## IND Wizard Module Version History

### CURRENT VERSION: INDWizardFixed.jsx (Version 5.0) - May 5, 2025

- IndWizardPage.jsx - Early prototype with basic functionality

## Version Control Strategy

To prevent future issues with losing work or reverting to old versions, we have implemented the following strategy:

1. **Clear Version Markers**: All components now include explicit version markers in file headers and import statements

2. **Warning Comments**: Warning comments have been added to critical areas of the code to prevent accidental reversion

3. **File Deletion**: All outdated implementations have been permanently deleted to prevent confusion

4. **Documentation**: This VERSION.md file serves as permanent documentation of the correct versions

5. **Consistent Naming**: The INDWizardFixed.jsx file uses a unique name to distinguish it from previous versions

## Best Practices for Future Development

1. **Never recreate old file names**: Do not create files with names matching the deleted versions

2. **Always build on the current version**: All new features should extend INDWizardFixed.jsx

3. **Update version numbers**: When making significant changes, increment the version number in the file header and this document

4. **Document changes**: Add detailed change notes to this VERSION.md file when updating components

5. **Include warning headers**: Always include warning comments when creating new major versions
