# eCTD Co-Author Module - User Workflow Guide

## Overview

The eCTD Co-Author Module revolutionizes regulatory document authoring by seamlessly integrating Microsoft Word with domain-specific AI to streamline the creation of submission-ready documents. This guide explains the end-to-end user workflow.

## Key User Workflows

### 1. Document Creation & Editing

**User Need**: Medical writers and regulatory professionals need a familiar, powerful editor to create high-quality documents while accessing specialized AI assistance.

**Workflow**:
1. User selects document type from regulatory templates (Module 2.5, 2.7, etc.)
2. System generates document structure based on selected regulatory region (FDA, EMA, PMDA)
3. User edits in Microsoft Word with all familiar features (formatting, track changes, comments)
4. Right panel provides context-sensitive AI assistance throughout the creation process
5. Document auto-saves to secure vault every 30 seconds

**Value**: Familiar Microsoft Word interface eliminates learning curve while providing specialized regulatory assistance.

### 2. Real-time Compliance Checking

**User Need**: Ensuring documents meet regulatory requirements before submission to avoid costly delays.

**Workflow**:
1. User clicks "Check Compliance" in editor toolbar
2. System analyzes document against regulatory frameworks (ICH, FDA, EMA)
3. Issues are highlighted directly in document with severity indicators
4. Each issue includes specific guidance and one-click fix options
5. Compliance score updates in real-time as issues are addressed

**Value**: Proactive compliance verification during authoring process reduces rework and submission delays.

### 3. Collaborative Review & Approval

**User Need**: Efficient cross-functional team review with clear accountability.

**Workflow**:
1. User assigns document sections to team members for review/approval
2. Reviewers receive email/notification with direct link to their section
3. Reviewers add comments or track changes directly in Microsoft Word
4. AI assistant suggests resolution options for each comment
5. Final approver can view all changes, accept/reject, and lock document

**Value**: Streamlines review process, reduces email chains, and provides audit trail.

### 4. Literature & Data Integration

**User Need**: Efficiently incorporating clinical data and literature with proper citations.

**Workflow**:
1. User highlights text requiring supporting evidence
2. AI panel suggests relevant literature and internal data from knowledge base
3. User selects appropriate references with one click
4. System automatically formats citations per style guide
5. Full bibliography is generated and maintained automatically

**Value**: Drastically reduces time spent searching for and formatting references.

### 5. Submission Package Assembly

**User Need**: Creating complete, validated eCTD submission packages.

**Workflow**:
1. User selects documents for submission from vault
2. System verifies completeness against eCTD requirements
3. Missing components are flagged with recommended actions
4. System generates proper XML backbone and metadata
5. Final package is validated and prepared for submission

**Value**: Eliminates technical complexity of eCTD preparation and ensures compliant submissions.
