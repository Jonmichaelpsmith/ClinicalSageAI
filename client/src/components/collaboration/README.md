# Project Collaboration Hub

This is a high-performance collaboration hub that integrates with all modules of the TrialSage platform. The hub provides real-time messaging, task management, milestone tracking, approval workflows, and AI-powered suggestions.

## Key Features

- Real-time team communication in project context
- AI-powered smart suggestions and task recommendations
- Milestone tracking with manager approval workflows
- Task management with priority-based organization
- Performance-optimized with code splitting and lazy loading

## How to Integrate

To add the collaboration hub to any module, wrap your page component with `OptimizedCollaborationLayout` and provide your current project information:

```jsx
// Example usage in CERV2Page.jsx or any other module
import OptimizedCollaborationLayout from '@/components/layout/OptimizedCollaborationLayout';

const YourModule = () => {
  const projectId = 'prj-001';
  const moduleName = 'cer';
  const currentUser = {
    id: '0',
    name: 'Current User',
    avatar: '/avatars/user.jpg',
    role: 'Regulatory Affairs Specialist'
  };

  return (
    <OptimizedCollaborationLayout
      projectId={projectId}
      moduleName={moduleName}
      currentUser={currentUser}
    >
      {/* Your existing module content */}
      <div>Your module content here</div>
    </OptimizedCollaborationLayout>
  );
};

export default YourModule;
```

## Performance Considerations

The collaboration hub is designed to have minimal impact on initial page load performance:

1. **Lazy Loading**: The collaboration hub is only loaded when the user expands it
2. **Code Splitting**: Components are split into smaller chunks loaded on demand
3. **Optimized Rendering**: Only necessary components are rendered based on the active view
4. **Efficient Icon Loading**: Icons are only imported when needed

These optimizations ensure that even large pages like CERV2 (4400+ lines) maintain good performance while still providing collaboration features.

## Integration with AI Services

The collaboration hub integrates with TrialSage's AI services to provide context-aware suggestions:

- Identifies missing information in regulatory documents
- Suggests next steps based on project stage and timeline
- Highlights potential compliance issues and offers mitigation strategies
- Recommends optimal task assignments based on team expertise

## Default User Interface

When first loaded, the collaboration hub appears as a narrow sidebar with just an icon. When the user clicks the icon, the full hub expands with tabs for:

- Activity Feed (team messages and AI suggestions)
- Tasks (grouped by status)
- Milestones (with progress indicators)
- Approvals (pending and completed)

Users can collapse the hub at any time to maximize screen space for the main application.
