PROTOCOL SUMMARY SNAPSHOT
================================

STUDY TITLE: 
Phase 2b Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of LTG-137 for Treatment of Refractory Psoriatic Arthritis

SPONSOR:
LumenBio Therapeutics

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:
To evaluate the efficacy of LTG-137 compared to placebo in subjects with moderate to severe psoriatic arthritis who have had an inadequate response to at least one conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (csDMARD).

POPULATION:
Adult patients aged 18-75 with active psoriatic arthritis diagnosis for ≥6 months who have failed at least one csDMARD therapy.

SAMPLE SIZE:
240 patients (1:1:1 randomization)

TREATMENT ARMS:
- LTG-137 150mg once daily
- LTG-137 300mg once daily
- Placebo

DURATION:
24-week treatment period with 4-week follow-up

PRIMARY ENDPOINT:
ACR20 response at Week 16

KEY SECONDARY ENDPOINTS:
- Change from baseline in HAQ-DI at Week 16
- PASI75 response at Week 16 (in subjects with ≥3% BSA)
- Resolution of enthesitis at Week 16
- Proportion of subjects achieving MDA at Week 24

RISK ASSESSMENT:
- Moderate dropout risk (expected 15%)
- Clear primary endpoint with established regulatory precedent
- Well-defined patient population with unmet need
- Competitive efficacy targets based on similar mechanism agents

INVESTMENT RECOMMENDATION:
POSITIVE - Protocol design demonstrates strong alignment with regulatory expectations, competitive positioning, and efficiency in execution.
