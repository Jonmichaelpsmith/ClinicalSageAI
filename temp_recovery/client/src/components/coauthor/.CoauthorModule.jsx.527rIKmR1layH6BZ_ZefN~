## 2.7.1 Summary of Biopharmaceutic Studies and Associated Analytical Methods

The biopharmaceutic development program for ENZYCURE (enzabidol) comprised a comprehensive set of studies designed to characterize the formulation's performance across various conditions.

### Bioavailability
Single-dose bioavailability studies demonstrated that ENZYCURE achieves therapeutic plasma concentrations within 2.1 ± 0.3 hours post-administration. The absolute bioavailability was determined to be 78.4% (90% CI: 74.2%-82.6%), indicating good oral absorption.

### Comparative BA/BE Studies
Bioequivalence was demonstrated between the clinical trial formulation and the commercial formulation, with the 90% confidence intervals for AUC and Cmax ratio falling within the accepted range of 80-125%.

## 2.7.2 Summary of Clinical Pharmacology Studies

### Mechanism of Action
ENZYCURE is a selective alpha-glucosidase inhibitor that acts by competitively blocking the enzyme responsible for carbohydrate digestion in the small intestine. This mechanism results in delayed glucose absorption and reduced postprandial hyperglycemia.

### Drug-Drug Interaction Potential
In vitro studies identified ENZYCURE as a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein. Clinical studies confirmed that no dosage adjustments are required when co-administered with common medications including metformin, glyburide, and simvastatin.

## 2.7.3 Summary of Clinical Efficacy

The clinical development program for ENZYCURE included 4 Phase 1 studies, 2 Phase 2 studies, and 3 pivotal Phase 3 studies. In total, 3,247 subjects participated across all studies, with 1,892 subjects receiving ENZYCURE at the proposed therapeutic dose.

### Study ENZ-301
This pivotal 26-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 734 patients with Type 2 diabetes. ENZYCURE demonstrated statistically significant reductions in HbA1c compared to placebo (-0.8% vs -0.1%, p<0.0001).

## 2.7.4 Summary of Clinical Safety

The safety profile of ENZYCURE has been characterized across 9 clinical studies involving 2,418 subjects exposed to the drug. The most common adverse events (≥5% and greater than placebo) were gastrointestinal in nature, including flatulence (12.3%), diarrhea (8.7%), and abdominal discomfort (6.4%).

No deaths were attributed to the study medication.`;
