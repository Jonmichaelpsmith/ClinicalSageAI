Here’s what I recommend we build next to turn your CER Generator into a truly world-class, end-to-end Co-Author and document management experience:

---

## 1. “Generate Full CER” Demo Button  
- **UI:** Add a prominent “Generate Sample CER Report” button at the top of the CER module.  
- **API:**  
  - **POST** `/api/cer/generate-full`  
    - Takes the current Device Info, PubMed searches, FDA AE pulls, etc.  
    - Returns a PDF or HTML draft of a complete Clinical Evaluation Report.  
- **UX:** Clicking it spins up a loading indicator, then displays an inline preview (PDF viewer) and a “Download Report” link.

---

## 2. “Past Reports” History Panel  
- **UI:** New collapsible sidebar on the CER page labelled **“Your CER Library”** showing a folder-style list of previous CER drafts and final reports.  
- **API:**  
  - **GET** `/api/cer/reports` → returns `[{ id, name, createdAt, status }]`  
  - **GET** `/api/cer/reports/:id/download` → streams the PDF  
- **UX:**  
  - Users can filter by date, status (draft vs final), or playbook template.  
  - Clicking a report drills in to preview or redrill into the Co-Author canvas for that section.

## 3. Deep Vault Integration  
Embed our TrialSage Vault into every module so that any report, section draft, or data source can be pulled directly from your secure document repository.  
- **UI:** “Attach from Vault” buttons on the Device Info panel, PubMed search results or AE tables.  
- **API:** Proxy `/api/vault/list` and `/api/vault/download/:fileId`.  
- **UX:** Instant retrieval and in-place insertion into your Co-Author or CER report.

---

## 4. Active-Learning Feedback Loop  
Enable “Approve” / “Reject” controls on any AI-generated draft block so that your corrections become part of the model’s memory:  
- **UI:** “👍 Approve” / “✍️ Edit & Retrain” toggles on each section.  
- **API:**  
  - **POST** `/api/ai/feedback` `{ sectionId, feedback: “approve”|"reject", editedText }`  
- **Model:** We’ll batch these feedback events and fine-tune an in-house LLM every night, so the AI gets smarter with your team’s style.

---

## 5. Pre-Built Templates & One-Click Submission  
- **Templates:** Three JSON playbooks (Fast IND, Full NDA, EMA IMPD) that users can import as starter projects—auto-wiring CMC, Clinical, Nonclinical, eCTD section skeletons.  
- **Validator:** Embed FDA’s eCTD validator JS client-side to catch XML/schema errors before export.  
- **Gateway Hooks:**  
  - **ESG (FDA):** Call `/api/cer/submit/esg` to push your package directly into eSubmit Gateway.  
  - **CESP (EMA):** Call `/api/cer/submit/cesp` with the eCTD package.

### Next Immediate Task  
Let’s implement **Step 2: the Past Reports History Panel** first, since that ties the module back into our Vault and showcases the end-to-end document management promise.  

1. **Data model:** Add a `CerReport` table/collection (`id, module, section, filename, status, createdAt, vaultFileId`).  
2. **Server:**  
   - Create `/api/cer/reports` (list) and `/api/cer/reports/:id/download`.  
3. **Front-end:**  
   - Build a `<CERHistoryPanel>` component in `client/src/components/cer/`.  
   - Wire it into `CERV2Page.jsx` alongside the tabs.  
   - Style it as a collapsible folder tree.  

Once that’s live, you’ll be able to see your past work in one place—and from there we’ll layer in the “Generate Full CER” button and Active-Learning loop.

Does that sound like the right next move? If so, I’ll drop in the file skeletons and get coding!
