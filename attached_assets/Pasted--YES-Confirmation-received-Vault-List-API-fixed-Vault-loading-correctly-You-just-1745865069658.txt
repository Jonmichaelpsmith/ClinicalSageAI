# ðŸ“£ Immediate Next Big Focus:

ðŸ‘‰ Now that Vault is live,  
âœ… we can move to the **AI Regulatory Advisor** layer inside the IND Wizard:

| What It Does | Value |
|:-------------|:------|
| Detects missing modules dynamically | âœ… |
| Warns user if CMC incomplete, Nonclinical missing, CSR missing | âœ… |
| Predicts Submission Readiness Score (e.g., 65% Ready) | âœ… |
| Gives real-time advice like \"Upload Stability Study\" or \"Draft Clinical Overview.\" | âœ… |

âœ… This will make TrialSage **not just a portal** â€”  
âœ… But a **real intelligent submission accelerator.**
