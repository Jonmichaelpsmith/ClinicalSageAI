Instructions for your Replit agent:

Insert this Markdown above the Bundles section in your landing page component (e.g. components/LandingPage.jsx inside a <Markdown> or next‑mdx block).

Ensure styling matches your theme (e.g., striped row backgrounds or subtle separators).

Verify mobile responsiveness so the table scrolls horizontally on small screens.

Add anchor link #how-it-works so you can link to this section from nav or CTAs.

Update bundle cards (as you’ve already scaffolded) to follow immediately after this table.

This “Solution Tour” will clearly tell the complete story of every tool in your platform, show how they fit together, and naturally lead prospects into the bundle entry points and live demos.
