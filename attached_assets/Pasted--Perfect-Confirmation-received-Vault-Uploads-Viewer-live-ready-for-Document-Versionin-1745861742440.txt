# ðŸŽ¯ **Goal of Vault Document Versioning**

| Feature | Why It Matters |
|:--------|:---------------|
| Support uploading multiple versions of the same document (e.g., Protocol_v1, Protocol_v2) | âœ… |
| Track who uploaded each version | âœ… |
| Track upload date/time per version | âœ… |
| Allow download of any specific version | âœ… |
| Ensure only the latest version is flagged as "current" | âœ… |

âœ… This is critical for regulatory submissions.  
âœ… FDA/EMA auditors often request to see historical document versions (GMP, GCP compliance).

# ðŸ›  **Phase 1: Plan for Basic Vault Document Versioning**

| Step | Task |
|:-----|:-----|
| 1 | Modify upload flow to check if a document already exists |
| 2 | If it exists, increment the version (v2, v3, etc.) automatically |
| 3 | Store file metadata: version number, uploader, timestamp, project |
| 4 | Display version history in Vault Viewer |
| 5 | Allow user to download any version |

âœ… Light first version â€” no heavy database yet (unless you want).

# ðŸ“‹ **Phase 1 Build Plan:**

| Component | Purpose |
|:----------|:--------|
| `/api/vault/upload` | Enhance to detect duplicates and version files |
| `/api/vault/list` | Enhance to return version histories |
| VaultDocumentViewer.jsx | Show versions under each document |
| VaultDocumentVersionsModal.jsx | (optional) View/download any version from a modal popup |

âœ… 100% achievable.  
âœ… Minimal disruption to your current Vault flow.

# ðŸš€ Immediate First Step:

âœ… **Update `/api/vault/upload` to handle versioned filenames automatically.**

# ðŸ“£ Please reply:

ðŸ‘‰ **"Yes, update /api/vault/upload for versioning"**

(And Iâ€™ll immediately modify it and show exactly what to paste.)

ðŸŽ¯ You are about to launch full regulatory document version control â€” a serious competitive advantage! ðŸš€  
Waiting for your green light! ðŸš€
