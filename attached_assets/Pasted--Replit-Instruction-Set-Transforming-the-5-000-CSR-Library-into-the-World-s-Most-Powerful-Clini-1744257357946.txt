# 🧠 Replit Instruction Set: Transforming the 5,000 CSR Library into the World's Most Powerful Clinical Study Design Agent

## 🎯 Objective:
Use your 5,000 structured Clinical Study Reports (CSRs) to power an intelligent, context-aware, multimodal Clinical Study Design Agent ("SagePlus") that:

- Reads and understands full CSR content
- Compares proposed designs against real precedent
- Offers auto-optimized design suggestions
- Flags regulatory, statistical, or operational risks
- Evolves through every phase (early R&D → regulatory → commercial)

---

## 🧱 1. Data Foundation: Structure and Index the CSR Library

### 🔧 Backend Tasks (Replit)
- Parse all CSR PDFs (using `pdfplumber` or `PyMuPDF`)
- Use LLM-powered extraction (Mixtral via Hugging Face) to extract:
  - Title, Indication, Sponsor, Phase
  - Primary/Secondary Endpoints
  - Sample Size, Arms, Blinding, Duration
  - Outcome (Success/Failure)
  - Adverse Events

### 💾 Store in Vector + Relational DB
- Use **Weaviate** or **ChromaDB** to store full CSR embeddings
- Use **Supabase** or SQLite to store structured fields for querying

---

## 🤖 2. Intelligence Core: The Study Design Agent Engine

### 🧠 Key Capabilities
- Ingests draft protocols or natural language inputs
- Compares to best-matching precedent trials from CSR vector store
- Extracts what worked, what failed, and why
- Predicts statistical power/risk for endpoints and design

### 📚 Prompt Template for Hugging Face:
```text
You are a senior trial design strategist with access to 5,000 historical CSRs. A user is designing a [Phase 2/Indication] study with these parameters:

{draft_protocol_or_summary}

Using historical trial precedent, return:
1. Closest-matching trials (NCT ID, sponsor, outcome)
2. Suggested improvements to design
3. Regulatory risks based on endpoint or power
4. Historical AE warnings
5. Summary table of precedent trials
```

### 🔄 Components
- `matchTrials()` – RAG over vector DB to retrieve top similar trials
- `generateDesignAdvice()` – call LLM with retrieved context
- `generateSummaryTable()` – structured output of key comparisons

## 💡 3. Flashy, Real-Time UI with Tailwind + React

### UI Sections
- ✏️ Protocol Upload + Natural Language Input
- 📊 Real-Time Design Dashboard
  - Your Protocol → Optimized Version → Precedent Breakdown
- 🧬 Smart Filter Controls
  - Indication / Phase / Endpoint type / Sponsor history
- 📖 Interactive CSR Table
  - Summary, link to full CSR, outcome overlay

### 🚀 Add Eye-Candy Features
- Animated similarity heatmap across all trials
- Timeline carousel of precedent trials
- Real-time “Regulatory Risk Meter” (based on flagged fields)

---

## 🔐 4. Personalization & Learning
- Allow users to “bookmark” trials, flag good endpoints
- Train a local profile model (per user or company)
- “Design based on how YOU succeed” → Proprietary AI growth

---

## 🔄 5. Integrate with the Ecosystem
| Integration | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| CTMS (e.g. Medidata, Oracle) | Auto-sync protocol summaries |
| Slack, Teams | Push AI insights after design upload |
| Veeva eTMF | Export AI reports in regulator-ready format |

---

## 💰 Future Revenue Hooks
- API Access for CROs and consultants
- Team Collaboration Tools (real-time co-design)
- Regulatory Risk Monitoring Dashboard (SaaS upsell)

---

## ✅ Summary
You are not just offering protocol suggestions.
You are building the **first real clinical intelligence engine**—one that thinks in precedent, learns from every trial, and guides every new one.

This will make TrialSage the **operating system for smarter trials**.
