# 📈 **Detailed Step-by-Step Tasks for Sprint 1:**

---

## 🛠 Step 1: Update and Expand UnifiedTopNavV3

✅ Add Breadcrumb Trail Below the Top Navigation Row:

| Example: |
```
🏠 Home > Regulatory Intelligence Hub > Risk Heatmap
```

✅ Breadcrumb Updates Dynamically Based on Page.

✅ Use small, clean TailwindCSS typography for breadcrumbs.

---

## 🛠 Step 2: Smooth Page Transition Animations

✅ On tab switch or page navigation:

| Add: |
```css
transition-all duration-500 ease-in-out
```
✅ To main containers like `<div className="p-8 space-y-6 transition-all duration-500 ease-in-out">`

✅ Gives a soft fade or slide transition.

✅ No more jarring view changes.

✅ Professional SaaS visual movement.

---

## 🛠 Step 3: Button + Tile Hover/Active Feedback Everywhere

✅ On all buttons:

| Add: |
```css
hover:bg-indigo-100 hover:text-indigo-700 transition-colors duration-200
```

✅ On all tiles (RiskHeatmap, Timeline Simulator):

| Add: |
```css
hover:scale-105 hover:shadow-lg transition-transform duration-300
```

✅ Smooth micro-interactions that **feel luxurious**.

✅ Users feel like the system is **fast, intelligent, and alive**.

---

## 🛠 Step 4: Mobile/Tablet Responsive Checks

✅ Adjust UnifiedTopNav:

| For smaller screens: |
- Stack rows vertically (Back | Forward | Home button row first)
- Tabs become horizontally scrollable (overflow-x-auto)

✅ Ensure RiskHeatmap wraps dynamically on narrow devices.

✅ Timeline Simulator slider collapses vertically.

✅ Ask Lumen AI chat panel collapses nicely into a modal/chat drawer.

✅ Regulatory executives use iPads — must look perfect!

---

## 🛠 Step 5: Consistent Font + Color Branding

✅ Finalize brand palette:

| Element | Color |
|:--------|:------|
| Main Accent (Buttons, Highlights) | #6366F1 (Indigo 500) |
| Critical Risk | #EF4444 (Red 500) |
| Medium Risk | #F59E0B (Amber 400) |
| Low Risk | #10B981 (Emerald 400) |
| Text Standard | #374151 (Gray 700) |

✅ Finalize font choices:

- Titles: Bold (20px+)
- Sections: Medium (16px)
- Body Text: Regular (14–16px)

✅ Consistent typography improves perception of stability and trust.
