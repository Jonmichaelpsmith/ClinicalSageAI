What I am about to fix:
âœ… Your current /server/server.js is serving hardcoded static files (like portal.html).

âœ… We need it to properly serve your React App (inside /client/build) for ALL routes except API endpoints.

âœ… After this fix:

Going to /client-portal will load your real React portal.

Clicking module tiles will go to your working placeholders.

Backend API /api/... routes will still function correctly.

âœ¨ Full Corrected server.js
Please copy this entire code into your /server/server.js in Replit:

javascript
Copy
Edit
// /server/server.js

const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');
const app = express();

// API routes
const projectsStatusRoutes = require('./routes/projectsStatus');
// (you can import other API routes like next-actions, vault, analytics here)

app.use('/api/projects', projectsStatusRoutes);
// Example: app.use('/api/next-actions', nextActionsRoutes);

// Serve React frontend
const clientBuildPath = path.join(__dirname, '../client/build');
app.use(express.static(clientBuildPath));

// Serve index.html for all non-API requests
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  if (req.originalUrl.startsWith('/api/')) {
    res.status(404).json({ message: 'API endpoint not found' });
  } else {
    res.sendFile(path.join(clientBuildPath, 'index.html'));
  }
});

// Start the server
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
ðŸ“‹ Important Notes About This server.js:

Feature	What It Does
/api/projects/... and future API routes	Still served separately by Express
/client-portal, /ind-wizard, /csr-analyzer, etc.	Served by React frontend (correctly)
Any other frontend route (*)	Falls back to React index.html
No static portal.html, no dead templates	âœ… Killed â€” forever
âœ… This is the modern correct setup.

âœ… This is how all real SaaS platforms work (React SPA + API server).

ðŸ“£ How to Apply:

Step	Action
1	Open /server/server.js in Replit
2	Select All (Ctrl+A or Cmd+A) and Delete
3	Paste the new clean code above
4	Save
5	Open Terminal and run:
bash
Copy
Edit
cd client
npm run build
(to build the React app into /client/build)

| 6 | Go back to root directory (/), restart the server ("Stop" then "Run") |

âœ… Now your app will serve the real intelligent Client Portal.

âœ… Clicking modules will work.
âœ… Smart project manager grid will appear.

ðŸš€ After this:
âœ… You will finally see all of our hard work show up properly.
âœ… No more old portal garbage.
âœ… Real TrialSage SaaS platform operational!

ðŸ“£ Please reply after you complete this:
ðŸ‘‰ "Server.js fixed and app rebuilt"

Then I will immediately help you connect your first live backend API (/api/projects/status) to your frontend grid.

(Almost there. You're doing this exactly right.) ðŸš€
Waiting for your update! ðŸŽ¯
