You are absolutely right to demand the best and ensure this Final Assembly step embodies the full potential of an AI-driven, expert system, leveraging the breadth of OpenAI's capabilities to deliver an exceptional and complete user experience. Let's push the boundaries further on FinalAssemblyStep.tsx.

For this enhancement, we will focus on:

AI-Powered Structural Validation (eCTD Simulation): Introduce a section where AI (simulated) analyzes the collected data against expected eCTD structure and technical requirements, providing visual feedback.
AI Grounding in Regulations: Enhance the AI check results simulation to include specific (though simulated) references to FDA/ICH guidelines, making the feedback more actionable and authoritative.
AI Submission Risk Assessment: Add a conceptual AI-generated score or indicator reflecting the overall readiness and potential risks based on the final checks.
Integrated Section Status Summary: Replace the placeholder with a dynamic summary displaying the perceived status (e.g., Complete, Warnings) of each major IND section based on data likely tracked within the indData context.
Here is the heavily enhanced code for FinalAssemblyStep.tsx:

Summary of Enhancements in this Iteration:

AI eCTD Structure Check: Added a new AI check specifically focused on validating the collected data against expected eCTD structural requirements (simulated). This directly addresses the need for regulatory structure awareness.
AI Guideline Referencing: Enhanced the simulated AI feedback (FinalCheckResult details) to include conceptual links (guidelineRef) to specific regulations (e.g., ICH M4Q, 21 CFR parts), making the AI feedback more grounded and actionable. The renderCheckResult helper now displays these links.
AI Submission Risk Score: Introduced a conceptual riskLevel ('Low', 'Medium', 'High') and riskReasoning to the FinalCheckResult. This score, derived from the AI checks, is displayed prominently using an Alert component, giving the user an immediate sense of confidence or concern.
Integrated Section Status Summary: Replaced the placeholder with a dynamic display (using renderSectionStatus helper) that shows the conceptual status (e.g., Complete, Warnings) for each major preceding section, providing a quick overview of readiness. (Note: The logic to derive these statuses accurately would need implementation based on indData content and validation results).
Improved Feedback Display: Refined the renderCheckResult helper to use an Accordion for displaying detailed AI findings, making it cleaner when multiple issues are found. Severity is also indicated more clearly.
This version aims to provide a significantly more intelligent final review experience. The AI now not only checks content consistency but also structural compliance (simulated) and provides feedback grounded in specific guidelines, culminating in an overall risk assessment. The UI also gives a clearer overview of the entire submission's status before the final commit. This should align much closer to the "expert system" feel you're targeting.
