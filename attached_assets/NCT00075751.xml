  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining bortezomib with gemcitabine and&#xd;
carboplatin in treating patients who have advanced or recurrent non-small cell lung&#xd;
cancer that has not been previously treated with chemotherapy. Drugs used in&#xd;
chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop tumor&#xd;
cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor&#xd;
cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. Bortezomib may also help&#xd;
gemcitabine and carboplatin kill more tumor cells by making the cells more sensitive to&#xd;
the drugs</textblock>

    <textblock>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xd;
&#xd;
I. To assess overall survival in chemo-naÏŠve patients with advanced non-small cell lung&#xd;
cancer (NSCLC) treated with combination of gemcitabine, carboplatin and PS-341.&#xd;
&#xd;
SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xd;
&#xd;
I. To assess response rate (confirmed plus unconfirmed, complete plus partial), in the&#xd;
subset of patients with measurable disease, progression-free survival and quantitative&#xd;
toxicities in this group of patients treated with this regimen.&#xd;
&#xd;
II. To investigate in an exploratory manner, the association of levels of hypoxia-induced&#xd;
secreted proteins and tumor DNA in plasma levels of apoptosis-associated proteins in&#xd;
tumor tissue, and the changes in the levels of PS-341 modulated proteins in peripheral&#xd;
white blood cells with patient response and survival.&#xd;
&#xd;
OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xd;
&#xd;
Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, carboplatin IV over&#xd;
15-30 minutes on day 1, and bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11.&#xd;
Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression&#xd;
or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease may continue to&#xd;
receive bortezomib alone on the above schedule for up to 1 year at the discretion of the&#xd;
treating physician.&#xd;
&#xd;
Patients are followed every 6 months for up to 3 years after registration.&#xd;
&#xd;
PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 99 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 months.</textblock>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>Inclusion Criteria:&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically proven selected stage IIIB (T4&#xd;
     lesion due to malignant pleural effusion) or stage IV, advanced non-small cell lung&#xd;
     cancer or recurrent disease after previous surgery and/or radiation&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  Patients with known brain metastases are not eligible for this clinical trial&#xd;
     because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive&#xd;
     neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other&#xd;
     adverse events; all patients must have a pretreatment CT or MRI scan of the brain to&#xd;
     evaluate for CNS disease within 28 days prior to registration&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  Patients must have measurable OR non-measurable disease documented by CT, MRI, or&#xd;
     x-ray; measurable disease must be assessed within 28 days prior to registration and&#xd;
     non-measurable disease must be assessed within 42 days prior to registration;&#xd;
     pleural effusions, ascites and laboratory parameters are not acceptable as the only&#xd;
     evidence of disease&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  Patients must not have received any prior systemic chemotherapy or biological agent&#xd;
     for non-small cell lung cancer; prior radiation is permitted; however, two weeks&#xd;
     must have elapsed since the completion of prior radiation therapy and patients must&#xd;
     have recovered from all associated toxicities at the time of registration;&#xd;
     measurable or non-measurable disease must be outside the previous radiation field or&#xd;
     a new lesion inside the port must be present&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  At least two weeks must have elapsed since surgery (thoracic or other major&#xd;
     surgeries) and patients must have recovered from all associated toxicities at the&#xd;
     time of registration&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  Serum creatinine =&lt; the institutional upper limit of normal OR a creatinine&#xd;
     clearance >= 60 cc/min; these tests must have been performed within 28 days prior to&#xd;
     registration&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  ANC >= 1500/ul obtained within 14 days prior to registration&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  Platelet count >= 100,000/ul obtained within 14 days prior to registration&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  Serum bilirubin =&lt; institutional upper limit of normal obtained within 28 days prior&#xd;
     to registration&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  SGOT or SGPT =&lt; 2.5 x the institutional upper limit of normal obtained within 28&#xd;
     days prior to registration&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  All patients must have a Zubrod performance status of 0-1&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  Peripheral neuropathy, if present, must be =&lt; grade 1 (NCI Common Terminology&#xd;
     Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0)&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  Correlative science studies: Institutions must have IRB approval of S9925 (the Lung&#xd;
     Cancer Specimen Repository); patients must be offered participation in S9925; with&#xd;
     the patient's consent, tumor tissue, blood and plasma will be submitted for testing&#xd;
     via S9925; patients must be registered separately to S9925 in order for institutions&#xd;
     to receive credit for specimen submissions&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  Patients known to be HIV positive and receiving anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) are&#xd;
     not eligible for this study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  Patients must not be planning to receive any other concomitant anticancer treatment&#xd;
     including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, biologic agents or any other&#xd;
     investigational drugs&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  Patients should not have known hypersensitivity to boron, mannitol, or PS-341; if&#xd;
     day 28 or 42 falls on a weekend or holiday, the limit may be extended to the next&#xd;
     working day; in calculating days of tests and measurements, the day a test or&#xd;
     measurement is done is considered day 0; therefore, if a test is done on a Monday,&#xd;
     the Monday four weeks later would be considered day 28; this allows for efficient&#xd;
     patient scheduling without exceeding the guidelines&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated&#xd;
     basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated&#xd;
     stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission or&#xd;
     other cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for 5 years&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  Pregnant or nursing women may not participate in this trial because of the increased&#xd;
     risk of fetal harm including fetal death from the chemotherapeutic agents; women/men&#xd;
     of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an&#xd;
     effective contraceptive method&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must sign&#xd;
     and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal&#xd;
     guidelines&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  At the time of patient registration, the treating institution's name and ID number&#xd;
     must be provided to the Data Operations Center in Seattle in order to ensure that&#xd;
     the current (within 365 days) date of institutional review board approval for this&#xd;
     study has been entered into the data base</textblock>
