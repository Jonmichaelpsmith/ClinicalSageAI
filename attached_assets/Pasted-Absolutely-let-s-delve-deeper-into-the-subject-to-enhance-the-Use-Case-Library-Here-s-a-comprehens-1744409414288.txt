## 🔍 Industry Challenges in Clinical Trial Protocol Design

### 1. **High Costs and Complexity**
- **Average Cost per Patient:**Approximately $41,413 ([Anju Software](https://www.anjusoftware.com/insights/eclinical/clinical-trial-costs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Daily Cost of Clinical Trials:**
  - **Phase I:**$7,829 per da
  - **Phase II:**$23,737 per da
  - **Phase III:**$55,716 per day ([Applied Clinical Trials](https://www.appliedclinicaltrialsonline.com/view/how-much-does-a-day-of-delay-in-a-clinical-trial-really-cost-?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 2. **Regulatory and Financial Reporting Challenges**
- **FASB Guidelines:**Under ASC 730, most R&D costs must be expensed as incurred unless they have an alternative future use ([PwC Viewpoint](https://viewpoint.pwc.com/dt/us/en/pwc/accounting_guides/property_plant_equip/property_plant_equip_US/chapter_7_other_asse_US/73_research_and_deve_US.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Tax Implications:**The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act requires capitalization and amortization of R&D costs over five years, impacting cash flow and financial statements ([RSM US](https://rsmus.com/insights/services/business-tax/faq-capitalization-and-amortization-of-r-d-costs-under-new-section-174-rules.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
