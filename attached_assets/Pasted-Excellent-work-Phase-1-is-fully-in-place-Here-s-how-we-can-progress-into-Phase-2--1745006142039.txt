Excellent work—Phase 1 is fully in place!  Here’s how we can progress into **Phase 2**:

## Phase 2: Full CTD Module Support & Versioning

### 2.1 Build Out Templates for Modules 1–5
- **Module 1 Forms:**  
  – Create Word/Jinja templates for FDA Form 1571, 1572, 3674 and cover letters.  
  – Auto‑populate sponsor, drug, protocol, investigator data from your data model.  
- **Module 2 Summaries:**  
  – Stub in simple narrative templates (to be replaced by AI later).  
  – Hook up your CER engine or basic text placeholders so the summaries render.  
- **Module 4 & 5 Templates:**  
  – Design templates for nonclinical study summaries and clinical protocols/IBs.  
  – Include Jinja loops for study tables or protocol sections.

### 2.2 Hook Up Real Data Sources
- **Benchling API Integration:**  
  – Replace the stub in `benchling_connector.py` with live HTTP calls (using your API key).  
  – Map real Benchling fields into your IND schema.  
- **LIMS/CSV Import:**  
  – Add an upload endpoint or connector to pull in QC/stability CSVs from your manufacturing system.

### 2.3 Version Control & Sequence‑Number Logic
- **Sequence Tracking:**  
  – In your FastAPI service, maintain a table (or JSON file) of the last used serial number per IND project.  
  – Every time you generate an initial IND or an amendment, auto‑increment (0000 → 0001 → …) and embed that in Form 1571 and your eCTD folder name.  
- **Git‑Backed or DB Versioning:**  
  – Commit each document generation run to a lightweight Git repo (or store a version record in your database) so you can roll back or diff between sequences.

### 2.4 Extend the React UI
- **Module Selector:**  
  – On the IND Automation page, add a dropdown or checklist to pick which module(s) to generate (1–5).  
- **Form Fillers for Module 1:**  
  – Render the 1571/1572/3674 forms in the UI for review before download.  
- **Version History View:**  
  – Add a “History” tab showing past sequence numbers, generation dates, and download links.

**Which of these would you like to tackle first?**  
1. Spinning up Module 1 form templates and auto‑filling them?  
2. Wiring the real Benchling API connector?  
3. Implementing sequence‑number tracking and version control?  
4. Expanding the UI for multi‑module generation and history?
