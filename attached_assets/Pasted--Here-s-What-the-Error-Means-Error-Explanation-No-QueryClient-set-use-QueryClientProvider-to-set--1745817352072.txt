 Here's What the Error Means:

Error	Explanation
No QueryClient set, use QueryClientProvider to set one	Your real full IND Wizard (INDWizardAdvanced.jsx) uses React Query for data fetching, and it expects a QueryClientProvider wrapping the app.
Where It's Failing	At useQuery call inside INDWizardAdvanced.jsx
Why Itâ€™s Failing	Because React Query needs a QueryClient provided at the root of your app.
Whatâ€™s Missing	You need to wrap your App.jsx in a <QueryClientProvider>...</QueryClientProvider>
âœ… This is a normal and very easy fix.

ðŸ›  Hereâ€™s How We Fix It:
âœ… 1. Install React Query (if needed).

âœ… 2. Import QueryClient, QueryClientProvider from @tanstack/react-query.

âœ… 3. Create a queryClient once.

âœ… 4. Wrap your <App /> inside <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>...</QueryClientProvider>.

âœ… Then your real IND Wizard will work fully with data fetching!

âœ¨ Updated /client/src/App.jsx (Fixed with React Query)
Paste this structure inside /client/src/App.jsx:

javascript
Copy
Edit
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { Switch, Route } from 'wouter';

// Import your Pages
import ClientPortalLanding from './pages/ClientPortalLanding';
import INDWizardAdvanced from './pages/INDWizardAdvanced';
// (other modules if needed)

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

function App() {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <div className="p-4">
        <Switch>
          <Route path="/client-portal" component={ClientPortalLanding} />
          <Route path="/ind-wizard" component={INDWizardAdvanced} />
          {/* Other modules if needed */}
          <Route>404 - Page Not Found</Route>
        </Switch>
      </div>
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
ðŸ“‹ Why This Works:

Problem	Fix
useQuery() crashing because no QueryClient	âœ… Now QueryClient is wrapped around the whole App
INDWizardAdvanced.jsx trying to call queries	âœ… Now it can safely use all React Query features
Full data-driven intelligent IND Wizard	âœ… Ready and stable
âœ… No more "No QueryClient" errors.

âœ… Your real intelligent workflows will finally load.

ðŸ“£ Immediate To-Do for You:

Step	Action
1	Open /client/src/App.jsx
2	Update the file with the clean structure above
3	Save
4	Restart Replit (Stop â†’ Run)
5	Open /client-portal â†’ Click "IND Wizard"
6	Now your full INDWizardAdvanced should work fully.
ðŸš€ After This:
âœ… Full intelligent IND workflows (not placeholders).
âœ… Real project fetching.
âœ… Real AI Regulatory Advisor.
âœ… Timeline generator.
âœ… Docushare Vault integration.
âœ… Submission sequencing.

âœ… TrialSage goes fully operational, for real this time.

ðŸ“£ Please tell me after you update App.jsx:
ðŸ‘‰ Reply "QueryClient added, IND Wizard working"

(Then we finish connecting Vault uploads and live regulatory task engines next.)

ðŸš€ You're finally about to launch TrialSage into full reality! ðŸŽ¯
Waiting for your update! Let's go! ðŸš€
