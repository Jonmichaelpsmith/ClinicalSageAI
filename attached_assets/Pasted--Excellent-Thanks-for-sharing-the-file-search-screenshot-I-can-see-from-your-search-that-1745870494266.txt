âœ… Excellent â€”  
âœ… Thanks for sharing the file search screenshot.

I can see from your search that your project already has some Heatmap components like:

- `RiskHeatmap.jsx`
- `TagCorrelationHeatmap.tsx`
- `EndpointFrequencyHeatmap.tsx`

âœ… This is fantastic because it means you already have **heatmap visualization capabilities** wired into your React project!

# ðŸŽ¯ **Hereâ€™s How We Should Leverage This Properly for TrialSage AI Advisor:**

---

# ðŸ“‹ **Plan to Build RiskHeatmapDashboard for Regulatory Intelligence**

| Step | Purpose |
|:-----|:--------|
| 1 | Use the existing `RiskHeatmap.jsx` component |
| 2 | Feed dynamic Risk data into the Heatmap (Red, Yellow, Green zones) |
| 3 | Map CTD Sections to Risk Zones based on Readiness Data |
| 4 | Display an interactive CTD Risk Heatmap Sidebar/Dashboard |
| 5 | Clicking a Red Risk zone could even navigate to the missing CTD module (future enhancement) |

âœ… Real-time visual intelligence.

âœ… Clients **instantly SEE** where their submission risks are.

âœ… Immense strategic value for Biotechs, CROs, Pharma.

# ðŸ“ˆ **Example TrialSage Risk Heatmap for IND/NDA Submission:**

| CTD Module | Risk Color |
|:-----------|:-----------|
| Module 1: Administrative | ðŸŸ¢ (Complete) |
| Module 2: Common Summaries | ðŸŸ¡ (Medium Risk - Nonclinical Overview missing) |
| Module 3: CMC Quality | ðŸ”´ (High Risk - Missing Stability Study) |
| Module 4: Nonclinical | ðŸŸ¡ (Medium Risk - Missing Genotoxicity Report) |
| Module 5: Clinical Reports | ðŸ”´ (High Risk - Missing Clinical Study Report) |

âœ… Visual.  
âœ… Instant diagnosis.  
âœ… Strategic action driver.

# ðŸš€ **Immediate Execution Plan:**

âœ… Step 1: Open `RiskHeatmap.jsx` and review current props expected.  
âœ… Step 2: Feed AdvisorSidebar Readiness/MissingSections/RiskLevel dynamically into RiskHeatmap.  
âœ… Step 3: Render it cleanly inside `/client-portal` or `/ind-wizard`.

âœ… Fully integrated real-time Regulatory Heatmap.

# ðŸ“£ Immediate Question:

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to:

- **A. Enhance and reuse RiskHeatmap.jsx directly?**  
  *(Fastest path â€” leverage what you already have.)*

or

- **B. Build a new AdvisorRiskHeatmap.jsx specialized for Regulatory Risk?**  
  *(Keeps separation clean if you want different heatmaps later for CERs, NDAs, INDs, etc.)*

âœ… Both are possible â€” itâ€™s just about how cleanly you want to structure your future system.

# ðŸ“£ Please reply:

ðŸ‘‰ **"A. Enhance RiskHeatmap.jsx directly"**  
or  
ðŸ‘‰ **"B. Build new AdvisorRiskHeatmap.jsx specialized"**

ðŸŽ¯ You are literally one build step away from having live dynamic Regulatory Heatmaps inside TrialSage! ðŸš€  
Waiting for your decision! ðŸš€
