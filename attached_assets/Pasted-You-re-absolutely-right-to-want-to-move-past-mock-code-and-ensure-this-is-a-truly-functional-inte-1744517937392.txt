You're absolutely right to want to move past "mock code" and ensure this is a truly functional, integrated application‚Äî**not just disconnected components that look good.**

Let me give you a fully clear, precise, and Replit-developer-friendly checklist and instruction set that ensures the **front-end and back-end are 100% wired together, tested, and functional.**

## ‚úÖ Replit Development Integration Instructions for Full Deployment

### üß± Goal:
Ensure every front-end component in `ProtocolPlanningDashboard.jsx` connects to its live, functioning backend route‚Äîand that data is flowing, responses render correctly, and reports are downloadable and emailable.

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Required Backend Routes (All Must Be Live)

| Endpoint | Purpose | Connected Component |
|----------|---------|----------------------|
| `POST /api/analytics/upload-protocol` | Accepts file upload and returns AI analysis | `ProtocolUploadPanel.jsx` |
| `POST /api/analytics/sample-size` | Returns calculated sample size | `SampleSizeCalculator.jsx` |
| `POST /api/analytics/dropout-estimate` | Predicts dropout risk | `DropoutEstimator.jsx` |
| `POST /api/analytics/success-probability` | Predicts trial success likelihood | `TrialSuccessPredictor.jsx` |
| `GET /api/intel/scheduled-report` | Triggers PDF report and email | Button in `ProtocolPlanningDashboard.jsx` |
| `/static/latest_report.pdf` | Hosts exported PDF for download | PDF download link |

‚úÖ All of these must return valid JSON and not 404 or error out.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Front-End Verification Checklist

| Component | Action Needed |
|----------|----------------|
| `ProtocolUploadPanel.jsx` | Ensure fetch uses correct `FormData()` and handles `.txt` or `.docx` type |
| `SampleSizeCalculator.jsx` | Inputs must convert to float/int correctly before POST |
| `DropoutEstimator.jsx` | Text inputs must POST JSON with all required fields (duration, control, arms) |
| `TrialSuccessPredictor.jsx` | Checkbox must POST as `has_biomarker: true/false`; numeric fields validated |
| `ProtocolPlanningDashboard.jsx` | Confirms that the email button triggers the `/scheduled-report` GET |

## üõ† Additional Instruction for Replit Team

> **Please confirm the following integration logic is respected throughout:**

1. The UI components are registered under your React app with working routes
2. All API fetch calls return live, correct data (not 500 or mock responses)
3. Static file serving is enabled (`/static/`) and `.pdf` is generated post-analysis
4. The user can:
   - Upload a protocol
   - View analysis
   - Predict dropout, success, sample size
   - Download and email PDF report
5. PDF generator script (`pdf_exporter.py`) must be run on analysis to ensure updated `latest_report.pdf`

## ‚úÖ 3. Test Instructions

Before calling this feature ‚Äúcomplete,‚Äù Replit should run this test:

| Action | Expected Result |
|--------|------------------|
| Upload `protocol.txt` | Summary + CSR match + confidence score appear |
| Click "Predict Success" | Probability and verdict shown |
| Click "Email Report" | Alert confirms delivery, PDF exists at `/static/latest_report.pdf` |
| Sample size input | Valid input returns `n` values |

---

## Final Note:
**No front-end feature should appear without a fully functional backend route and actual data flow.** TrialSage is not a concept demo‚Äîthis is a tool for real-world biotech decision-making.
