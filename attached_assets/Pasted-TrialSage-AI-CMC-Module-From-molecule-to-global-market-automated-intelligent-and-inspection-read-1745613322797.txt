Automatically formatted Word/PDF/eCTD-compatible files

Optional auto-diagramming:

Uses OpenAI Vision + SVG generation to produce:

Process flow diagrams

Reaction schemes

Equipment layout illustrations

AI Innovations:
Fine-tuned GPT prompts + training on validated CMC examples

Uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to cite regulatory precedent from prior CSRs or health authority documents

Offers in-line citations, glossary standardization, and regulatory justification language

Value Added:
Reduces weeks or months of writing time to hours

Provides standardized, validated, submission-ready text that regulatory affairs can refine

Avoids duplication across product lines by reusing components (e.g., if excipients or methods are shared)

2. AI Change Impact Simulator (AICIS)™
"Before making a CMC change, simulate its risk across global markets and systems."

Key Functions:
Select from 100+ predefined CMC change types (e.g., new API supplier, process scale-up, excipient replacement)

Upload impacted documents or parameters

Simulator returns:

Regulatory impact by market (notification, variation, resubmission)

Predicted timeline impact and dossier sections affected

Recommended bridging studies, justifications, or comparability data

Risk score with rationale

Draft HA response if questioned

Smart link to QMS: trigger change controls or validation plans automatically

AI Innovations:
Trained on global health authority variations databases (e.g., EMA Type IA/B, FDA supplements)

NLP engine reads historical submissions to predict HA concerns

Generates decision trees dynamically—"If X, then Y required in Japan, Z in FDA"

Value Added:
Empowers teams to make faster, safer, globally aligned decisions

Prevents last-minute delays caused by unanticipated regulatory hurdles

Turns change management into a regulatory-strategic function

3. Manufacturing Intelligence Tuner™
"Benchmark and improve your process using AI + global precedent mining."

Key Functions:
Upload or connect to:

Batch records (CSV, XML, PDFs)

Equipment logs, SCADA output

Lab notebooks or data tables

Tuner compares your process against:

Thousands of semantically parsed CSRs

Global submissions with similar compounds/processes

Produces:

Benchmark reports (yield %, deviation trends, step risk)

Flagged inefficiencies (e.g., step with excessive variability)

Suggested SOP improvements

Revised control strategies and validation summaries

AI Innovations:
Semantic similarity matching of process narratives + yield data

Embedding engine maps similarity in unit operations, equipment, excipients, even molecule class

GPT suggestions auto-generate improved language and control logic

Value Added:
Transforms manufacturing documentation into a competitive asset

Enhances tech transfer readiness and process standardization

Identifies risk and waste before regulators or inspectors do

4. Preclinical-to-Process Translator™
"Instantly scale lab discoveries into commercial process frameworks."

Key Functions:
Upload preclinical protocols or lab-scale formulations

Outputs:

AI-drafted scale-up strategy

Equipment and facility requirements

Potential failure points or red flags (e.g., toxic solvents, filtration incompatibility)

Draft validation protocols

Manufacturing batch instructions (draft MBR)

AI Innovations:
Uses AI process simulation logic to map small-scale data to commercial requirements

Learns from industry precedent + ICH Q8/Q11/Q12 guidance

Flags items with no scale-up precedent or toxicological concerns

Value Added:
Accelerates IND and Phase 1 readiness

Prevents failed tech transfer due to overlooked incompatibilities

Aligns CMC early with clinical and regulatory planning

5. Global Compliance Auto-Match™
"Write once, file anywhere—AI maps CMC data across global HA formats."

Key Functions:
Start with a base Module 3 document

AI remaps content to:

FDA, EMA, PMDA, NMPA, ANVISA, Health Canada

Local structure and formatting standards

Adjusts:

Terminology (e.g., “drug substance” vs “active ingredient”)

Referencing standards

Units and justifications

Provides:

Change tracking log per region

Auto-generated regional annexes (e.g., Japanese stability protocols)

AI Innovations:
Trained on regulatory formatting rules, dictionaries, and prior filings

Uses translation + rewriting models for localization

Cross-validates document versions against regional HA templates

Value Added:
Avoids duplication, inconsistency, and translation risks

Speeds up global filings by 80%

Enables small teams to act like global regulatory powerhouses

6. Real-Time Audit Risk Monitor™
"Stay inspection-ready with AI-powered audit simulations and gap detection."

Key Functions:
Constantly analyzes all CMC documents and SOPs

Detects:

Outdated or contradictory information

Missing links between validation studies and final specs

Gaps in document lineage (e.g., missing change logs)

Maps findings to known FDA/EMA/PMDA findings

Generates:

Risk heatmaps per document or product

Remediation task list

Inspector Q&A simulator (predicts likely inspector questions)

AI Innovations:
Uses FDA 483 and EMA non-compliance databases to identify pattern risks

Employs AI chain-of-trust logic to trace document integrity

Simulates regulatory review mindset (what a reviewer might question)

Value Added:
Turns reactive gap finding into proactive readiness

Ensures nothing is missed before an inspection or submission

Offers unprecedented peace of mind to compliance and QA leaders

Bonus Innovation: CMC CoPilot™
