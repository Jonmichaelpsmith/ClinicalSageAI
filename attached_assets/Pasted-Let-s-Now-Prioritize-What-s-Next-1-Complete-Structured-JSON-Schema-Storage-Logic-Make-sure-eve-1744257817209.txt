Letâ€™s Now Prioritize What's Next
ðŸŸ¨ 1. Complete Structured JSON Schema & Storage Logic
Make sure every extracted CSR outputs a consistent JSON structure:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "csr_id": "A0081186",
  "title": "...",
  "indication": "...",
  "phase": "Phase 2",
  "arms": ["Placebo", "50mg", "100mg"],
  "primary_endpoints": ["Change in EDSS score"],
  "outcome": "Positive (p<0.01)",
  "adverse_events": [{ "event": "Nausea", "grade": 2, "count": 8 }],
  "raw_text": "...",
  "vector_summary": "...",
  "embedding": [0.234, 0.554, ...]
}
âœ… Next: Validate and normalize schema in csr_extractor.py, and store full JSON in /data/processed_csrs/.

ðŸŸ¨ 2. Plug Vector Store + Metadata into Search Layer
Use chromadb or weaviate to store vectorized summaries

Store csr_id, phase, indication, success flags, etc., in SQLite or Supabase for filtering

âœ… Next: Create csr_search.py to run queries like:

python
Copy
Edit
search_by_embedding("Phase 2 NSCLC trial with ORR endpoint")
search_by_field(phase="Phase 3", indication="Ulcerative Colitis")
ðŸŸ¨ 3. Expose API for Frontend and SagePlus AI Agent
Create /api/csrs/query endpoint that accepts:

text_query (semantic search)

filters (indication, phase, etc.)

optional draft protocol for similarity scoring

âœ… Next: Scaffold csr_api.py using FastAPI or Flask

ðŸŸ© 4. Pipeline Enhancements (LLM-powered Extraction)
In csr_extractor.py, improve accuracy with:

Mixtral or Phi-2 prompt to label sections

Section-to-field mapping (via keyword + prompt combo)

Error recovery + logging

ðŸŸ¦ 5. Real-Time UI for Monitoring + Querying
React/Tailwind dashboard to:

View ingested CSRs

Search by keyword/filters

Visualize vector matches (e.g. cosine similarity)

âœ… Next: Start building csr_dashboard.jsx with filters + table view

ðŸ§  Optional Enhancements to Queue Up
Feature	Benefit
ðŸ“ˆ Auto-Fail Classifier	Flag high-risk trials (design pitfalls, AE load, etc.)
ðŸ§ª Interactive Protocol Comparison Tool	Match draft to N top similar CSRs
ðŸ§­ Timeline Viewer	Show trial journey from CSR summary
ðŸ§¬ Endpoint Frequency Map	Guide endpoint selection per indication
ðŸ“¤ Export to Notion, Slack, PDF	Instant protocol support tool
ðŸš€ Your Suggested Next Move
Would you like me to now:

Generate csr_search.py for filtering + embedding search?

Build the FastAPI backend (csr_api.py) for frontend/agent access?

Create the csr_dashboard.jsx interface?

You're building what will be the clinical search engine of recordâ€”letâ€™s make it tangible.
