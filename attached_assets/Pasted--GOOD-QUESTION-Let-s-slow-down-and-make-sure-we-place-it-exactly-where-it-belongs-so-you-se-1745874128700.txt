âœ… GOOD QUESTION â€”  
âœ… Let's slow down and make sure we place it exactly where it belongs, so you see it correctly.

# ðŸŽ¯ **Where AdvisorRiskHeatmapV2 Should Be Visible**

| Correct Placement | Why |
|:-------------------|:---|
| Inside the **AdvisorSidebarV3** | The Heatmap is a key part of the Regulatory Intelligence Advisor Panel. |
| AdvisorSidebarV3 should be already mounted onto main pages | `/client-portal`, `/ind-wizard`, `/vault`, and inside each CTD Module page if you want full real-time guidance. |

âœ… So Heatmap must be **embedded inside AdvisorSidebarV3.jsx**.

âœ… NOT its own separate page.

âœ… Itâ€™s PART of the real-time Advisor Panel showing Readiness, Risk, Next Actions â€” and now **Visual Risk Zones** (Heatmap).

---

# ðŸ“‹ **How It Should Be Wired (Simple and Clean):**

âœ… Inside `/client/src/components/advisor/AdvisorSidebarV3.jsx`:

- After you show **Critical Gaps**
- Before or after you show **Next Best Actions**

âœ… Import AdvisorRiskHeatmapV2:

```javascript
import AdvisorRiskHeatmapV2 from './AdvisorRiskHeatmapV2';
```

âœ… Then **embed it into your JSX** inside AdvisorSidebarV3:

```javascript
{/* Risk Heatmap */}
<AdvisorRiskHeatmapV2 missingSections={readiness.missingSections || []} />
```

âœ… Now whenever AdvisorSidebarV3 loads,  
âœ… It passes the live `missingSections` list into the Heatmap,  
âœ… Heatmap paints real-time regulatory risks dynamically.

# ðŸ“£ **Quick Visual Placement Example:**

```jsx
<div className="p-6 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md space-y-6 w-full">
  <PlaybookSelector currentPlaybook={selectedPlaybook} onSelectPlaybook={setSelectedPlaybook} />

  {/* Progress Circle */}
  {/* Risk Level */}
  {/* Estimated Filing Date */}
  {/* Active Playbook Display */}

  {/* Critical Gaps */}
  <div>
    <h3 className="text-sm font-semibold mt-6">Critical Gaps:</h3>
    <ul className="mt-2 list-disc list-inside text-xs text-red-500 space-y-1">
      {readiness.missingSections.slice(0, 5).map((gap, idx) => (
        <li key={idx}>{gap}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  </div>

  {/* Risk Heatmap */}
  <AdvisorRiskHeatmapV2 missingSections={readiness.missingSections || []} />

  {/* Recommended Actions */}
  {/* Estimated Financial Delay */}
</div>
```

âœ… Very clean.

âœ… Very SaaS-grade.

âœ… Immediate real-time visualization for the user.

# ðŸš€ After You Embed It:

âœ… Open `/client-portal` or `/ind-wizard`.

âœ… On the right side, in the Advisor Sidebar,  
âœ… You will now see:

- Progress Circle
- Risk Badge
- Estimated Filing Date
- Active Playbook
- Missing Critical Gaps
- ðŸ“ˆ **AND the New AdvisorRiskHeatmapV2 Dynamic Grid**!

âœ… Showing Red, Yellow, Green risk zones per missing CTD section.

# ðŸ“£ Immediate Action:

| Step | Action |
|:-----|:-------|
| 1 | Open `AdvisorSidebarV3.jsx` |
| 2 | Import `AdvisorRiskHeatmapV2.jsx` |
| 3 | Embed `<AdvisorRiskHeatmapV2 missingSections={readiness.missingSections || []} />` into sidebar |
| 4 | Save |
| 5 | Refresh `/client-portal` or `/ind-wizard` |

âœ… TrialSage will now show full dynamic risk visualization properly.
