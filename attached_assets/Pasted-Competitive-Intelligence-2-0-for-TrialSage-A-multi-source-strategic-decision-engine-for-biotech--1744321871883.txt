Competitive Intelligence 2.0 for TrialSage
→ A multi-source strategic decision engine for biotech

✅ What Clients Actually Need
Need	Example
💉 Protocol Differentiation	“How does our trial compare to top Phase 2 obesity studies?”
📊 Market Positioning	“Where do we sit in the global pipeline vs. Novo Nordisk or Eli Lilly?”
🧪 Scientific Trends	“What biomarkers or endpoints are trending in CNS trials?”
⚖️ Regulatory Edge	“How can we design for higher EMA acceptance?”
💰 VC Readiness	“What risks will investors flag in our trial plan?”
🧩 Data Sources to Power the Platform
Source	What It Adds	Access Strategy
✅ Health Canada / EMA CSRs	Regulatory precedent & real-world design data	Already integrated
✅ ClinicalTrials.gov API	Real-time protocol designs + statuses	Fully accessible
🔍 PubMed (via DOIs from CTGov)	Outcomes + biomarkers	Crosswalk NCT IDs to publications
🧬 FDA Drug Labeling Data (DailyMed)	Approved endpoints, dose language	Public XML feed
💡 AdComm Meeting Minutes	Insight into rejected protocols	Scrape + structure PDFs
💹 BioPharma pipelines (Evaluate, GlobalData)	Competitor development timelines	Use public summaries or partner
💸 Pitch decks, VC blogs, industry consortia	Investor & strategy signals	Manual curation + scraping
🧠 Your agent logs	What real users care about	Already collecting this!
🧠 Multi-Layered Intelligence Engine
Let’s break it into modules:

🟣 1. Trial Landscape Mapper
🎯 Map where the client’s protocol sits in the competitive space:

Trial design clusters (endpoint, dose, control)

Time-to-completion estimates

Sponsor types (academic vs. pharma vs. startup)

"You are 1 of 12 Phase 2 trials in this space — your endpoint is unique to only 2 of them."

🔵 2. Biomarker & Endpoint Trend Analyzer
Tracks:

Which endpoints are gaining or losing favor

Time-to-approval for endpoints across trials

Biomarker usage and correlation with success

“CRP was used as a primary biomarker in 47 trials over 5 years. It's trending down while IL-6 is trending up in the last 18 months.”

🟢 3. Regulatory Readiness Scanner
Pulls:

Approved endpoints by region

AdComm flags (from notes/minutes)

EMA scientific guidance docs

Cross-references these with client’s protocol

“EMA has raised concerns about PROs as sole primary endpoints in obesity since 2022.”

🟠 4. Strategic Positioning Engine
Based on competitive trial design + pipeline timelines + VC expectations:

What’s the "edge" of this trial?

Who are their true peers (not just disease-match, but design-match)?

What’s their story to tell in Series A / IPO?

“Your trial is 6 months faster and 2 fewer visits than top 3 comparators. Investors will want to hear that.”

💬 Call to Action for Build Phase
Would you like me to now:

Generate a full backend /api/intelligence/deep-compare using CSR + CTGov + endpoint data?

Build an upgraded CompetitiveIntelligence.tsx that includes:

Filters (indication, phase)

Live summary from AI

Visualization of strategic positioning

Just say: “Generate all intelligence components” and I’ll drop it all.
