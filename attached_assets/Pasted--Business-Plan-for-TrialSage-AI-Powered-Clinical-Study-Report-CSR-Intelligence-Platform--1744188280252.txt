**Business Plan for TrialSage: AI-Powered Clinical Study Report (CSR) Intelligence Platform**

---

**Executive Summary**
TrialSage is an AI-powered SaaS platform that extracts, organizes, and commercializes structured insights from publicly available Clinical Study Reports (CSRs). Targeted at early-stage biotech startups, CROs, and investors, the platform provides a fast, searchable, and filterable interface to analyze historical clinical trials. By streamlining access to study designs, endpoints, and regulatory outcomes, TrialSage helps de-risk new trials, accelerate protocol development, and improve regulatory alignment.

**Problem**
Early-stage biotechs waste significant resources designing trials from scratch or relying on generic consulting. Critical trial intelligence is buried in lengthy CSR PDFs, which are:
- Hard to find
- Difficult to search or parse
- Inaccessible without proposal processes (e.g., CSDR, YODA)
- Not structured or filterable

---

**Solution**
TrialSage turns publicly available CSRs into structured, searchable intelligence. It offers:
- A clean user interface to explore, search, and filter CSR data
- Structured extraction of endpoints, populations, outcomes, safety profiles
- AI-powered protocol generator based on historical trials
- Competitive benchmarking tools for design differentiation

**Market Intelligence**
- ~6,000–10,000 biotech startups globally
- 40,000+ clinical trials per year worldwide
- $60B–80B annual biotech investment globally
- $10M–$20M average cost of Phase 2 trial
- $100K–$500K average spend on protocol design consultants

**Total Addressable Market (TAM):**
Conservative B2B SaaS market of $500M+ annually for structured trial intelligence and protocol design tools.
