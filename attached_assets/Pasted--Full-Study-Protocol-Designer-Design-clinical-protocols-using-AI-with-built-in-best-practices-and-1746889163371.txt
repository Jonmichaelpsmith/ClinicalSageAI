Investigator-Initiated Clinical Trial Road Map
TrialSage™ streamlines the complex clinical trial process with intelligent automation at each critical stage.

How TrialSage Accelerates Clinical Development
The road from protocol development to trial operations typically takes 12-18 months. TrialSage™ reduces this timeline by:

Automating Protocol Development

Our Study Architect™ tool generates protocols with pre-validated elements that ensure regulatory compliance.

Streamlining Ethics Applications

IND Wizard™ pre-validates documents to ensure compliance with ethical review requirements.

Expediting Registration

Automated registration document generation with ICH compliance verification saves weeks of preparation time.

Breaking the 10% Success Barrier
Traditional clinical development has a 90% failure rate due to poor study design and execution. TrialSage™ tools are designed to elevate success rates at each critical phase.

Phase I
First-in-human (20-80 subjects)
70% Success
Phase II
Efficacy testing (100-300 subjects)
33% Success
Phase III
Confirmatory (1,000-3,000 subjects)
25-30% Success
90% FAILURE RATE
Only 10% of drug candidates ultimately receive regulatory approval
How TrialSage™ Improves Success Rates
TrialSage™ addresses the core reasons for clinical trial failures through:

Optimized Protocol Design

Our AI analyzes thousands of successful studies to design protocols with higher probability of success.

Precise Patient Selection

Machine learning algorithms identify optimal inclusion/exclusion criteria that correlate with successful outcomes.

Early Risk Detection

Predictive analytics flag potential safety and efficacy issues before they become critical failures.

Success Story:
A mid-sized biopharma client achieved 42% higher Phase II success rates using TrialSage™ optimized protocols.

How TrialSage™ Supports Your Regulatory Journey
TrialSage™ modules map directly to these regulatory activities, providing intelligent assistance at every phase:
