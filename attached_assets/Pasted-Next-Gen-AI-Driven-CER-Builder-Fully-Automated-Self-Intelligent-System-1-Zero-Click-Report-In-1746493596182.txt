📁 Vault stores every version with:

Timestamps

Redline diffs

Author log

🧭 6. AI Guidance & Real-Time Q&A
AI explains every section with citations:

“Why is this risk considered low?”

GPT-4 answers with:

“Based on 1.2% AE rate across 3 comparator studies and no FAERS death reports, this risk is classified as low.”

Interactive Q&A panel appears next to preview

📊 7. Risk Intelligence Dashboard
Live chart of:

Risk scores by severity

Comparator class benchmarks

Timeline vs. regulatory deadline

Heatmap flags high-risk gaps

GPT suggests mitigation or updated positioning

🛡 8. Full Audit + Submission Automation
Every generation and edit is timestamped

Audit logs exported with submission

Optional EUDAMED-ready metadata format

Upload gateway to:

Notified Bodies

US FDA (via eSTAR format)

Future: PMDA, TGA, Health Canada

Here is a full description of the user workflow and the corresponding system (AI/automation) workflow inside the TrialSage CER Generator — as it's now designed to function as a complete, intelligent, end-to-end CER automation platform.

👤 USER WORKFLOW vs 🤖 SYSTEM WORKFLOW
Goal: Generate a fully compliant, regulator-ready Clinical Evaluation Report (CER) with near-zero manual effort.

🧭 Step 1: Project Kickoff – “Create New CER”
👤 User Action	🤖 System Behavior
Clicks "Create New CER"	Initializes new report instance with unique ID
Enters product name (e.g., “Stentra LX”)	Auto-fetches regulatory metadata: UNII, ATC class, GMDN, MoA
Selects device type & regulatory region	Pre-loads section requirements based on EU MDR / FDA track
Clicks “Begin”	Launches Section Generator and triggers FAERS ingestion

🧱 Step 2: Core Section Generation
👤 User Action	🤖 System Behavior
Chooses section (e.g., Safety Profile)	Retrieves relevant data context (FAERS, comparators, clinical)
Provides optional context or files	Auto-parses content using NLP/OCR
Clicks “Generate”	GPT-4o writes full section with formatted content and citations
Reviews, edits, and confirms	Stores section in report draft state

🧬 Step 3: Automated Data Intelligence
👤 User Action	🤖 System Behavior
[No input]	System auto-fetches FAERS data via OpenFDA
Maps product → UNII → FAERS → AE profiles
Scores risk (weighted algorithm: death, hospitalization, etc.)
Identifies comparators by ATC class
Fetches comparator risk scores and writes summary language
Opens “Preview” tab	CER preview shows all sections, FAERS tables, and risk charts

📚 Step 4: Literature Review (Optional / Recommended)
👤 User Action	🤖 System Behavior
Uploads PDFs or searches studies	AI extracts methods, endpoints, sample size, and outcomes
Reviews summaries and selects studies	GPT-4o generates Literature Review section with citations
Adds to report	Automatically inserted into CER draft

⚖️ Step 5: Regulatory Scoring & Validation
👤 User Action	🤖 System Behavior
Clicks “Validate CER”	System checks compliance: EU MDR Annex XIV, ISO 14155, FDA flags
Identifies missing sections, low-quality data, non-compliant phrasing
Auto-fixes minor gaps (e.g., missing rationale for equivalence)
Views dashboard	See pass/fail, score % by section, suggested remediations

📤 Step 6: Export, Archive, Submit
👤 User Action	🤖 System Behavior
Clicks “Export PDF” or “Export Word”	Generates formatted file: TOC, FAERS tables, citations, appendices
Clicks “Save to Vault”	Saves version with timestamp, author, and hash
(Optional) Sends to reviewer/client	System generates share link (public or role-protected)

🧠 Optional: AI Q&A Review
👤 User Action	🤖 System Behavior
Clicks “Ask about this section”	GPT explains AI’s reasoning, justifies risk assessments
Types question (e.g., “Why is risk low?”)	Answers using real-world data, studies, and regulatory logic

🔁 SYSTEM WORKFLOW SUMMARY (Behind the Scenes)
🔧 System Task	Description
FAERS Pull	Product → UNII → FAERS search → Risk scoring → Store in DB
Comparator Analysis	ATC class match → Pull peer substances → Score → Compare
Literature AI	PubMed & PDF upload → GPT summarization → Evidence table → AI drafting
Clinical Ingestion	CSV, XLSX parsing → Endpoint detection → Table generator
Section Generation	GPT-4o prompt → Context → Formatting → Markdown → Save
Compliance Engine	Rule engine: EU MDR, ISO 14155 → Flag → Remediate → Score
Export System	Render full report in PDF/Word, inject TOC, charts, annexes
Document Vault	Store per version, track redlines, attach authorship metadata
Q&A Chat	Contextual chat over section with justification, citations, GPT-4

Would you like me to now create a workflow diagram, or begin finalizing the Literature Review tab with PDF upload + AI summary?
