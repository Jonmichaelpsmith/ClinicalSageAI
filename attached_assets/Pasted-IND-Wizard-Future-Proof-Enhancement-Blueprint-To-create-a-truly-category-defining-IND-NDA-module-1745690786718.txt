IND Wizard — “Future-Proof” Enhancement Blueprint
To create a truly category-defining IND/NDA module (well beyond Veeva Vault Submissions and Certara Synapse), we need to weave together deep automation, structured data, AI copilots, and regulatory tech standards. Below is a next-generation roadmap that adds 10× value on top of today’s build.

0 · Architectural Shift

Change	Why
Move from document-first to data-first	Store every section as structured JSON (markdown, tables, datasets) → render to any output (PDF, DOCX, eCTD XML, ESG ZIP, EDMS view).
Event-driven micro-services	Use Supabase realtime channel or NATS: on SectionSaved → triggers AI validation, knowledge-graph update, reviewer notification.
Graph engine	Neo4j (Aura) or pg_graph: links drug → batch → stability → study ➜ enables cross-section consistency checks.
1 · Hyper-Smart Authoring

Feature	How It Works
Contextual AI Copilot	GPT-4o w/ RAG over Vault + public guidance. Prompts adapt to region, drug class, First-in-Human vs 505(b)(2).
Auto-Population Rules	“If stability study STB-123 exists → pre-fill Module 3.2.P.8.1 summary table.” DSL stored in authoring_rules.
Interactive Templates	TipTap + React Hook Form: dynamic placeholders ({{DrugName}}, {{ExcipientRatio}}) validated live.
Inline Citations	AI returns <sup data-cite="doc123#p4">1</sup>; hover shows PDF snippet.
2 · Deep Regulatory Intelligence

Need	Solution
Guidance delta tracking	nightly crawler of FDA, EMA Q&A, ICH Q-docs. Flag if submission cites superseded guidance.
Region-aware validator	XSLT + Schematron rules for eCTD v4 EU, US, CH. Real-time linter pane shows XPath to error.
Gap Matrix	Pivot table: section × study × dataset. Shows at a glance what’s missing for each indication or formulation.
3 · Collaborative & Controlled Workflow
Branching & Merge
– Writers can branch a Module, work in isolation, PR-style merge back (Yjs snapshots diff).

Comment → Task conversion
– Any inline note can be promoted to a task with assignee, due date, SLA.

e-Sign
– Dual authentication pop-up, hashed to audit-ledger; meets 21 CFR 11.

Live presence & cursor roles
– Distinct colors per role (CMC, Non-Clinical, Clinical, Regulatory).

4 · Submission Packaging & Gateway Integration

Layer	Detail
eCTD 4.0 Composer	Builds full backbone.xml, moves assets to /m1/us/ etc., computes MD5, builds index-md5.txt.
FDA ESG / CBER NextGen	SFTP or AS2 upload, poll for ACK 1/2/3, auto-attach to Vault.
Validation Stack	BEFORE upload run: (1) GlobalSubmit Validator CLI, (2) Lorenz eValidator API.
One-click archive to Vault	Final ZIP pushed to “Submissions / {{ year }} / IND-{{ seq }}” folder, status = submitted.
5 · Intelligence & Analytics
Time-to-submit KPI – per section, per author, per study.

AI Effort-Saved Meter – tokens vs human typed chars.

Deficiency Predictor – model trained on FDA RTF letters; flags high-risk sections.

6 · Security / Compliance

Area	Hardening
Field-level RLS	Only Non-Clinical team can edit Module 4; CMC sees 3.x only.
Immutable ledger	Hash-chain all Yjs snapshots → Postgres Ledger; optional anchor to BTC-OP_RETURN (monthly).
PHI Redaction	Policy engine scans uploads; PHI redacted or encrypted before AI context ingestion.
Disaster Recovery	Daily S3 Cross-Region replication of submission ZIPs; point-in-time DB recovery.
7 · Adoption Path & MVP Slices

Sprint	Deliverable	Time (wks)
1	Replace PDF generator with data-first TipTap markdown → PDF-Lib pipeline.	2
2	AI Copilot with inline citations for Modules 2.7 & 2.5.	3
3	Region validator (XSD + Schematron) & real-time linter pane.	2
4	Multi-user Yjs presence, comments, branch/merge snapshots.	3
5	eCTD composer & ACK ingestion.	2
6	e-Sig & immutable ledger.	2
Exact Next Steps
Confirm which sprint(s) to code first.

I’ll drop a complete canvas module for that sprint: DB schema, Node routes, React components, cron jobs, tests.

Iterate until all seven layers are live.

Tell me:
“Start with Sprint 1 and 2” or “Build validator first” — and we’ll begin concrete implementation immediately.
