Increasing the intensity of an exercise intervention has been proposed as one method for rescuing NRs by producing beneficial changes. However, this theory has not been tested on NRs classified using glycemic outcomes. This study will evaluate if increasing the intensity of an exercise intervention will elicit a response within previous exercise NRs.","detailedDescription":"Exercise can effectively slow the progression towards Type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, data suggest large interindividual variability exists in glycemic response to exercise, resulting in a subset of individuals known as exercise non-responders (NRs). Emerging research proposes that altering the parameters of an exercise intervention to provide a sufficient stimulus can elicit a response in those previously identified as NRs. To date, no research has attempted to rescue previously classified NRs based on glycemic outcomes by altering the parameters of an exercise intervention.\n\nThis study will implement an exercise program targeted at achieving the Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines, and calculate the number of NRs. We will then evaluate if increasing the intensity of exercise will elicit response to the treatment in the NRs.\n\nSixty adults living with prediabetes or T2D will be recruited into one of a control group, or an exercise group. The exercising participants will begin a 16-week exercise intervention, targeted at achieving 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity (equating to 4.5 METs) aerobic physical activity per week. Following the 16-week exercise program, participants will be randomized into two groups, each completing an additional 12 weeks of exercise. The first will maintain the same time and intensity, while the other will complete the 150 minutes per week at an intensity equal to 6.0 METs. Randomization will occur in blocks in order to ensure an equal number of NRs in each group."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["PreDiabetes","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2","Exercise","Physical Activity"],"keywords":["Exercise Response","Interindividual Variability"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Participants will first be randomized as controls or exercisers.
