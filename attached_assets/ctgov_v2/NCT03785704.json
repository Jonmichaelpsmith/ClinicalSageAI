The present study was aimed to observe and evaluate the effect of Xinmailong injection on reducing cardiovascular toxicity associated with adjuvant chemotherapy after breast cancer surgery. The primary endpoint was 6 months of cardiac safety. Secondary endpoints included 3 months of cardiac safety, adverse events (AE), severe adverse events (SAE), and DFS.","detailedDescription":"After signing the informed consent, the patients in the control group will receive Epirubicin 45mg/m2 d1, 2 + cyclophosphamide 600mg/ m2 d1, repeated every 14 or 21 days for 4 cycles, followed by paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 (or docetaxel 75 mg/m2) on day 1, repeated every 21 days for 4 cycles. Patients in the Xinmailong group were given 5 mg/kg of Xinmailong injection every cycle on d0, d1, d2, d3, d4 on the same chemotherapy regimen as those in the control group. The patients-general condition, vital signs, blood routine, liver and kidney function, electrocardiogram, myocardial enzymes, troponin, BNP and echocardiography should be examined every week. Breast ultrasound were performed every week. Chest CT were evaluated after 8 cycles of chemotherapy.\n\nAfter adjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant radiotherapy and endocrine therapy were given according to the situation, and long-term survival was observed.\n\nThe patients will be followed up for 5 years, once every 6 months with in 1-3 years, once every 12 months within 4-5 years."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Breast Neoplasms","Cardiac Event","Chemotherapeutic Toxicity"],"keywords":["Xinmailong injection","anthracycline induced cardiac toxicity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Totally 60 subjects will be included in the study.Random assignment was 1:1 to Xinmailong injection group and control group.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Xinmailong injection group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"given 5 mg/kg of Xinmailong injection every cycle on d0, d1, d2, d3, d4 on the same chemotherapy regimen (EC-T) as those in the control group.","interventionNames":["Drug: Xinmailong Injection"]},{"label":"control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"receive conventional EC-T regimen chemotherapy (Epirubicin 45mg/m2 d1, 2 + cyclophosphamide 600mg/ m2 d1, repeated every 14 or 21 days for 4 cycles, followed by paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 (or docetaxel 75 mg/m2) on day 1, repeated every 21 days for 4 cycles)."}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Xinmailong Injection","description":"Xinmailong injection is extracted, separated, purified and refined from Periplaneta americana.
