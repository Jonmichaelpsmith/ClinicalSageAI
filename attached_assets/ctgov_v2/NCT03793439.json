The primary endpoint for this study is a 50% or greater reduction in corticosteroid requirement.","detailedDescription":"Primary Objectives:\n\nObjective 1: Test the hypothesis that the addition of tofacitinib will allow patients with sarcoidosis to have 50% or greater reduction in their corticosteroid requirement without a significant decrease in pulmonary function testing, and with a similar quality of life as measured by a validated questionnaire (1).\n\nObjective 2: Test the hypothesis that the addition of tofacitinib will result in significantly decreased expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1 dependent gene expression.\n\nOutline:\n\nThis is a 16-week open-label, interventional, proof of concept, hypothesis-generating study. All subjects will receive Tofacitinib 5mg twice daily for 16 weeks. After four weeks on Tofacitinib, the corticosteroid will be tapered per a pre-defined protocol; once a reduction of 50% has been achieved, any further taper will be per physician discretion. After 16 weeks, subjects who meet the primary end-point will be permitted an optional one year open-label extension."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Sarcoidosis, Pulmonary","Sarcoidosis Lung","Sarcoidosis"],"keywords":["Sarcoidosis","Corticosteroid dependent sarcoidosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Open-label, interventional, proof of concept, hypothesis-generating study","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":5,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Open-label treatment","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"All subjects will receive tofacitinib 5mg twice daily from week 0 to week 16, and a corticosteroid taper starting at week 16.
