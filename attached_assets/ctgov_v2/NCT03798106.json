Pro-angiogenic factors suppress various immune functions whereas antiangiogenic agents have potential to modulate the tumor microenvironment and improve immunotherapy. An analysis of patients with RCC treated with pazopanib demonstrated that elevated expression of PD-L1 correlates with shorter PFS. Investigator also identified 43% of PD-L1 expression in STS and PD-L1 expression had worse overall survival (5-year survival rate: 48% in PD-L1 positive vs. 68% in PD-L1 negative, p=0.015). In detail, PD-L1 expression was reported 52.6% in synovial sarcoma, 37.6% in rhabdomyosarcoma, and 100% in epithelioid sarcoma. For this orphan tumor, STS, PD-L1 targeting may be a promising strategy and favorable toxicity may warrant further combination."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Sarcoma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":46,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"durvalumab+pazopanib","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Durvalumab 1500mg IV 1hr q3weeks Pazopanib 800mg QD PO q3wwks","interventionNames":["Drug: Durvalumab, pazopanib"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Durvalumab, pazopanib","description":"Durvalumab 1500mg IV 1hr q3weeks Pazopanib 800mg QD PO q3wwks","armGroupLabels":["durvalumab+pazopanib"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Objective Response Rate","description":"antitumor efficacy of durvalumab and pazopanib","timeFrame":"12 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
