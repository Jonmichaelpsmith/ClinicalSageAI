Reframing the Use Case Library: “Strategic Displacement Engine”
🔍 Every Use Case Must Now Show:
Section	Content
🎯 Problem in Industry	How this challenge is currently solved (consultants, CROs, slide decks, spreadsheets)
💸 Cost of Legacy Approach	Example cost: $35K consultant + 4 weeks = slow and shallow
🔍 Pain	Lack of precedent, risk of rejection, opaque decision logic
🔁 TrialSage Solution	Which modules activate (CSR search, predictor, optimizer, SAP)
🧠 Intelligence Output	What the user sees + what TrialSage decides
📈 ROI / Value	Time saved, quality increased, compliance improved
🧾 FASB Value	Does this output count toward asset development? (capitalizable, deferrable)
📄 Deliverables	PDF report, SAP section, design optimization table
▶️ Try This Use Case	Launch into TrialSage workflow
📥 Download Sample Report	Live preview of what you’d get
🧠 Example: “Phase 1 IND Justification (Biotech Founder)”
🎯 Industry Status Quo
“Founders spend $20K–$50K on consultants to design a Phase 1 study — mostly from templates — and still get challenged by FDA.”

💸 Cost
$35K consultant

6 weeks to deliver

Limited to 2–3 slides with static precedent

🔁 TrialSage
Module	Value
CSR Benchmark	Extracts Phase 1 precedents from 186 similar trials
AI Risk Predictor	Trained on >2,000 CSRs
Optimizer	Adjusts sample size + AE capture logic
SAP Generator	Writes adaptive dose logic aligned with 2023 EMA trends
📈 ROI
Time saved: 5 weeks

Cost avoided: $38K

FASB: Yes — protocol justification and SAP can be capitalized as R&D assets

Risk mitigated: Avoided FDA protocol hold (3 month delay)
