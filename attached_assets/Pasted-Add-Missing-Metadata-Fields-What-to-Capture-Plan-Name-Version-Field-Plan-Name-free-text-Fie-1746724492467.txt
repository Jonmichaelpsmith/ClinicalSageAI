Add Missing Metadata Fields
What to Capture
Plan Name & Version

Field: “Plan Name” (free text)

Field: “Plan Version” (auto-increment or semantic versioning control)

Author Name & Role

Auto-populate from the logged-in user’s profile

Allow override in case a delegate is entering the data

Date Created / Last Updated

Read-only timestamp fields

Linked CER Version

Dropdown showing current CER draft versions (e.g. “v2.3”)

Ensures traceability: this QMS plan applies specifically to that document

How It Interoperates
UI: These fields appear in a header bar of the QMS Plan tab.

Reporting: On export, they form the top “Title block” of the QMS section.

Audit Trail: Any change to these fields triggers a log entry (older version → newer version).

2. Enhance Quality Objective Cards
For each Objective card in the QMS Plan:

New Fields & Controls
Scope Selector

Multi-select list of CER sections (Safety, Literature Review, Benefit-Risk, etc.)

Ties the objective back into the Section Generator’s available section types

Mitigation / Control Actions

Larger free-text box describing “What we will do” (e.g., “Run data consistency script weekly”)

Optionally attach SOP references or checklists

Objective Status Badge

States: Planned / In Progress / Complete / Blocked

Color-coded (e.g. gray, blue, green, red)

Interactions
Drag-and-Drop Reordering so users can prioritize objectives.

Inline “Add CtQ” Button that opens a mini-form directly under the objective.

Interop
Compliance Engine: Reads each objective’s scope to know which sections to evaluate.

Dashboard Metrics: Totals objectives by status and shows percentage completed.

3. Build Gating Logic in the Section Generator
Pre-Generation Validation
High-Risk CtQ Check

Before a user clicks “Generate Section,” if any High-risk CtQ factors tied to that section are unmet, show a modal:

“Warning: 2 High-risk factors for ‘Safety Profile’ are not yet satisfied. Proceed?”

Offer “View CtQ Details” → scrolls the QMS panel to those factors.

Mandatory CtQ Enforcement

Optionally, make this gating strict: disable “Generate” button until all mandatory CtQs for that section show green “Satisfied” status.

How It Works
Data Flow: The Section Generator queries the QMS datastore for CtQs where associatedSection == currentSection.

UX: The Generate button shows a tooltip if gating conditions are unmet:

“Cannot generate – resolve CtQ factors.”

4. Surface Audit-Trail Icons & eSign-Off
Audit Trail
Per-Change Badges

On each Objective/CtQ card, a small clock icon that, when hovered, shows:

“Last edited by Jane Doe on 2025-05-10 14:23”

Global Change Log View

A collapsible panel at the bottom of the QMS Plan tab listing every modification in chronological order.

eSignature
Sign-Off Button

After finalizing objectives and CtQs, an orange “eSign QMS Plan” button appears.

Signature Dialog

Prompts user to re-enter password or use biometric (depending on your auth stack)

Captures signer name, role, date/time, and version of QMS Plan being signed

Lock-Down

Once signed, the plan becomes read-only; any further edits require a new version (incrementing Plan Version).

5. Wire QMS Plan into Export Templates
Document Structure
Insert QMS Section

After “Evaluation Plan” in the table of contents, add “3. Quality Management Plan.”

Render Plan Metadata

Plan name, version, author, date, CER version, signature block.

List Objectives & CtQs

A two-tiered table:

Tier 1: Objectives table (ID, Description, Scope, Risk, Mitigation)

Tier 2: For each Objective, a nested table of CtQs (Name, Description, Associated Section, Risk, Mitigation, Status)

Hyperlinked Anchors

Each “Associated Section” cell in the CtQ table hyperlinks to the corresponding heading in the main CER.

How It Integrates
Export Engine merges this QMS content into the Word/PDF builder pipeline.

Version Control stamps the QMS section with the Plan Version and adds it to the document’s metadata.

6. Hook Compliance Engine & AI Prompts
AI Prompt Enrichment
Context Block

When generating a section, prepend the AI prompt with a summary of relevant Quality Objectives and CtQs in plain language:

“Quality Objective: Ensure Clinical Data Integrity. CtQ Factors: ‘Literature Search Comprehensiveness’ (High risk)…”

Instruction Injection

Include: “When drafting the Safety Profile, ensure you address all High-risk CtQs: [list].”

Compliance Validation
Automated Rules

The Compliance module runs a final pass reading the QMS Plan:

Checks if each High-risk CtQ has “Satisfied” status.

Verifies that all Associated Sections exist and contain content.

Reporting

If a CtQ is unsatisfied, the compliance report flags it as an open non-conformity with a remediation suggestion.

7. Scheduler & “Living CER” Banner
Scheduler
Risk-Based Frequencies

High-risk CtQs → every 90 days

Medium → every 180 days

Low → yearly

UI Scheduling Controls

In the QMS Plan tab, show next review date per CtQ.

Allow override of schedule on a per-CtQ basis.

Living CER Banner
Banner Text

At top of CER Builder:

“Living CER: Last updated 2025-05-07. Next scheduled review: 2025-08-05.”

New Data Alerts

If new FAERS or literature arrives before next review, change banner to:

“New data available – click to refresh QMS Plan and CER.”

Bringing It All Together
By executing each of these richly detailed steps, you’ll transform the QMS Plan from “nice-to-have” into a fully integrated, audit-ready, risk-managed backbone that:

Governs every data pull, AI generation, and compliance check

Provides clear traceability from quality objectives to report sections

Surfaces status and accountability at every stage

Automates your reminders so the CER remains genuinely “living”

This not only meets the letter of ICH E6(R3) and EU MDR but elevates your CER Module to industry-leading, quality-by-design sophistication.
