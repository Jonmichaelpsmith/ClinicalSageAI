Okay, moving on. We've established the MilestoneTracker component as a template for the quality and interactivity we're aiming for.

The next logical step is to continue building out the PreIndStep.tsx component, incorporating the other required elements for the "Initial Planning & Pre-IND" stage with the same enterprise-grade approach.

Let's enhance the "Pre-IND Planning" section within PreIndStep.tsx by adding more detailed fields for meeting preparation, using react-hook-form, zod, and shadcn/ui components. We'll add fields for:

Meeting Objectives
Proposed Agenda Topics
Key Attendees
I'll update the PreIndStep.tsx code, integrating these new fields into the form schema and UI.
Enhanced Pre-IND Step Component (React/TS/shadcn)
Apr 21, 10:31 AM

Key Enhancements in this Version:

Detailed Pre-IND Fields: Added specific fields for Meeting Objectives, Agenda Topics, and Attendees.
Dynamic Lists: Implemented simple input + button logic to manage arrays for Agenda Topics and Attendees directly within the form state using react-hook-form's setValue. Displayed items using shadcn/ui Badges.
Integrated MilestoneTracker: The MilestoneTracker component is now properly integrated. Its state changes are synced back to the main form's state using the onMilestonesChange callback, ensuring milestones are part of the overall step data.
Schema Update: The zod schema (preIndStepSchema) is updated to include the new fields and the milestones array.
Contextual AI Triggers: Added AI help tooltips (HelpCircle icon) next to relevant fields like Project Name and Objectives, calling the handleAiTrigger function.
UI Structure: Used Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardDescription, CardContent, Separator to better organize the sections within the step.
This PreIndStep.tsx component is now significantly more detailed and functional, aligning better with the enterprise-grade requirements for this specific stage.

What would you like to focus on next? We could:

Refine the state management (e.g., implement actual API calls for saving drafts via TanStack Query mutations).
Build out the AI Co-Pilot panel interaction logic.
Move on to designing the next step in the wizard (e.g., Nonclinical Data Collection).
Further enhance the MilestoneTracker (e.g., add inline editing).

Note that we are leveraging all OPENAI Solutions for this project to. Also enhance your last work. I expect better.




Show thinking
Okay, I understand. You want to push beyond the current implementation of PreIndStep.tsx towards a truly dynamic, interactive, and AI-infused experience that feels less like a static form and more like an intelligent assistant, leveraging the full potential of OpenAI solutions.

Let's enhance PreIndStep.tsx further by focusing on:

Proactive AI Suggestions: Implementing UI elements and simulated workflows for the AI Co-Pilot to actively suggest content (e.g., agenda topics).
Server State Management: Integrating useMutation from TanStack Query for saving data, providing user feedback on save operations.
Richer List Management: Improving the UI for handling lists like Agenda Topics and Attendees.
Loading/Feedback States: Incorporating visual feedback for asynchronous operations like AI suggestions or saving data.
First, ensure TanStack Query is set up with a QueryClientProvider higher up in your application tree, as shown previously.

Here's the enhanced PreIndStep.tsx code, updating the existing immersive artifact:

Summary of Enhancements:

TanStack Query Integration:
Added useMutation (mutation) for handling the save operation (apiSavePreIndData simulation). The main onSubmit function now calls mutation.mutate(values).
Added useQuery (initialData) example for fetching initial draft data (currently disabled but shows the pattern).
Included loading (mutation.isLoading) and error (mutation.isError) state display from the mutation for user feedback.
The "Save and Next" button in the main layout should now trigger form.handleSubmit(onSubmit) to initiate the save process.
Proactive AI Suggestions:
Added "AI Suggest Topics" and "AI Suggest FDA Questions" buttons.
Implemented fetchAndShowAiSuggestions to simulate calling a backend AI service (apiFetchAiSuggestions).
Used AlertDialog from shadcn/ui to display loading states (Loader2) and the fetched suggestions.
Added functionality (addSuggestionToForm) to allow users to directly add AI-suggested agenda topics to the form.
Richer List Management:
Switched to using useFieldArray from react-hook-form for managing Agenda Topics and Attendees. This provides a more robust way to handle dynamic arrays within the form.
Rendered each item with an Input field and a "Delete" (Trash2) button for better editing and removal.
Loading/Feedback:
Added loading skeletons (Skeleton) for the initial data fetch state.
Used Loader2 icon and disabled state for AI suggestion buttons during loading.
Utilized use-toast for success/error feedback on save operations and AI suggestions.
This version integrates asynchronous operations (saving, AI suggestions) with user feedback and provides more direct AI assistance, moving closer to the dynamic, enterprise-grade experience you described. We can continue refining this step or move to the next stage of the IND wizard.
