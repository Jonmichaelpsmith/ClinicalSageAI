Below is an in‑depth explanation and design plan for **Number 2: Data Integration and Normalization**. This phase is the vital bridge between raw data collection and advanced analytics/narrative generation. Its purpose is to take the diverse, multi‑source data obtained (via web scraping, APIs, etc.) and transform it into a unified, standardized format that can be easily analyzed and reported in your CER.

## Overview

Data Integration and Normalization involves:
- **Consolidating Data:** Merging information from sources such as the FDA Device Complaint Database, EU Eudamed, and FDA FAERS.
- **Standardizing Formats:** Converting data fields (dates, identifiers, terminologies) into a consistent format.
- **Mapping and Reconciling Fields:** Aligning the different field names and structures (e.g., complaint date vs. receipt date) to a common schema.
- **Aggregation & Summarization:** Grouping and summarizing data, such as counting the number of complaints per device or adverse event.
- **Error Handling:** Logging, handling missing values, and ensuring data quality.

## 1. Data Sources and Their Challenges

### A. FDA Device Complaint Database  
- **Data Type:** HTML-based, scraped data  
- **Challenges:**  
  - Varying layouts and field names  
  - Missing fields or inconsistent formats  
  - Need to convert narrative text into structured information (e.g., complaint ID, device name, complaint date)

### B. EU Eudamed  
- **Data Type:** Partially available, web-based or API if available  
- **Challenges:**  
  - Incomplete dataset and possible differences in terminology compared to FDA sources  
  - Less standardization and potential for additional missing data

### C. FDA FAERS  
- **Data Type:** Often delivered as JSON via OpenFDA API  
- **Challenges:**  
  - Large volume of records  
  - Complex nested fields  
  - Need to map adverse events to standardized vocabularies (e.g., MedDRA)

## 2. Establishing a Common Data Model

Before you can combine data from these sources, you need to define a target schema that covers the necessary fields in your CER. An example schema might include:

- **Identifier Fields:**  
  - `source` (e.g., FDA_Device, EU_Eudamed, FDA_FAERS)  
  - `record_id` (unique identifier from the source)

- **Product/Device Information:**  
  - `device_name` or `drug_name`  
  - `device_code` or `ndc_code`  

- **Complaint/Event Details:**  
  - `event_type` (e.g., complaint, adverse event)  
  - `event_description` or narrative  
  - `event_date` (normalized to a standard ISO format)  

- **Quantitative Metrics:**  
  - `count` (if applicable; e.g., number of occurrences)

- **Additional Fields:**  
  - Demographics (if available)  
  - Source metadata (e.g., retrieval timestamp)

This schema becomes the blueprint into which all raw data is transformed.

## 3. The ETL Pipeline

The process typically involves three main steps:

### A. Extraction  
Each data source is queried by its dedicated module (for example, using web scraping for FDA device complaints or API calls for FAERS data). Each module outputs data in its native format.

**Example:**  
For FAERS data using the OpenFDA API (in JSON), you would use:
```python
import requests

def extract_faers_data(drug_code, limit=100):
    url = f"https://api.fda.gov/drug/event.json?search=openfda.product_ndc:{drug_code}&limit={limit}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json()
```

### B. Transformation  
This is where normalization happens:
- **Date Conversion:**  
  Transform dates into ISO 8601 format.  
  ```python
  from datetime import datetime

  def normalize_date(date_str):
      # Example: Convert "01/02/2023" to "2023-01-02"
      try:
          return datetime.strptime(date_str, "%m/%d/%Y").isoformat()
      except Exception:
          return None
  ```
- **Field Mapping:**  
  Rename keys to match the common schema (e.g., "complaint_date" → "event_date").  
- **Value Standardization:**  
  Apply consistent representations (e.g., standardizing "complaint" vs. "adverse event", converting texts to lowercase/uppercase if needed).
- **Aggregation:**  
  If multiple records refer to the same product or event, aggregate them accordingly.

**Example Transformation Function:**
```python
def transform_record(raw_record, source):
    # Define common mapping based on source
    if source == "FDA_Device":
        return {
            "source": "FDA_Device",
            "record_id": raw_record.get("complaint_id", None),
            "device_name": raw_record.get("device_name", "").strip(),
            "event_type": "complaint",
            "event_description": raw_record.get("narrative", "").strip(),
            "event_date": normalize_date(raw_record.get("complaint_date", "")),
            "count": 1  # Each complaint is counted as 1
        }
    elif source == "FDA_FAERS":
        # Adjust based on the FAERS data structure:
        return {
            "source": "FDA_FAERS",
            "record_id": raw_record.get("safetyreportid", None),
            "drug_name": raw_record.get("openfda", {}).get("brand_name", [""])[0],
            "event_type": "adverse_event",
            "event_description": raw_record.get("patient", {}).get("reaction", [{}])[0].get("reactionmeddrapt", ""),
            "event_date": raw_record.get("receiptdate", None),  # Might need normalization
            "count": raw_record.get("count", 1)
        }
    # Additional sources would have analogous mapping
```

### C. Load  
After transforming the data, load it into a central repository or a persistent cache (using Redis for temporary caching and a database for long-term storage). This normalized data then becomes the source for subsequent analytics and report generation.

**Example Load Step (using Redis):**
```python
from redis_cache import set_cache

def load_normalized_data(key, data, ttl=600):
    # Save the normalized data in cache for 10 minutes
    set_cache(key, data, ttl)
```

---

## 4. Data Merging Across Sources

Once each source is normalized to the common schema, the next challenge is to combine them:

- **Deduplication:**  
  Identify and merge duplicate records that might appear in more than one source. For instance, if a complaint is reported by both FDA and Eudamed, you’d merge details into a single record.
  
- **Aggregation:**  
  Summarize data by product codes. For example, count total complaints/adverse events, compute the median event date, etc.
  
- **Contextual Linking:**  
  Link data from drug and device sources if there’s overlap (for example, a drug administered via a device might show signals in both FAERS and device complaint databases).

**Example of Aggregation:**
```python
def aggregate_data(records):
    aggregated = {}
    for record in records:
        key = record.get("device_code") or record.get("drug_code")
        if key not in aggregated:
            aggregated[key] = {
                "total_complaints": 0,
                "events": []
            }
        aggregated[key]["total_complaints"] += 1
        aggregated[key]["events"].append(record)
    return aggregated
```

---

## 5. Handling Data Quality and Errors

- **Validation:**  
  Check that each transformed record contains mandatory fields (e.g., an event date, event type).  
- **Error Logging:**  
  Log records that fail transformation for later review.  
- **Flexibility:**  
  Design the transformation functions to handle missing values gracefully, allowing downstream modules (analytics, narrative generation) to adapt accordingly.

---

## 6. Scheduling and Automating the Integration

- **Regular Updates:**  
  Use background tasks or a scheduler (e.g., Celery Beat) to periodically run the extraction and transformation processes.  
- **Caching Strategies:**  
  Cache the transformed data to minimize repeated extraction operations, especially if the underlying data does not change frequently.

**Example Scheduler Setup (Pseudo-code):**
```python
from celery import Celery
from celery.schedules import crontab

celery_app.conf.beat_schedule = {
    'update-fda-device-data-every-hour': {
        'task': 'tasks.update_fda_device_data',
        'schedule': crontab(minute=0, hour='*'),  # every hour
    },
    'update-faers-data-every-hour': {
        'task': 'tasks.update_faers_data',
        'schedule': crontab(minute=0, hour='*'),
    },
}
```

## Summary

The **Data Integration and Normalization** phase is about taking the raw, heterogeneous data collected from public sources and transforming it into a unified, standardized format. This allows your automated CER module to perform accurate analysis, generate compelling visualizations, and build a compelling narrative that regulators and clinicians can trust.

Key steps include:

- **Extraction:** Retrieve data via web scraping or API access.
- **Transformation:** Clean, map, and standardize data fields, ensuring consistent formatting (e.g., dates, event types).
- **Loading:** Store the normalized data—using persistent caches (like Redis) and possibly a long-term database.
- **Merging and Aggregation:** Combine data from multiple sources and aggregate statistics, resolve duplicates, and create a unified data model.
- **Automation and Quality Checks:** Schedule regular data refreshes, handle errors gracefully, and log transformation issues for continuous improvement.

This standardized data is then ready to feed into analytical models, narrative generation processes, and ultimately form the backbone of your comprehensive CER.
