  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>This study will evaluate brain pathways involved in feeling pain and pain relief&#xd;
following administration of pain medication. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be&#xd;
used to measure brain activity at sites that become more active following oral surgery&#xd;
and then to see if the activity changes after pain medication is administered. MRI&#xd;
combines a powerful magnet with an advanced computer system and radio waves to produce&#xd;
detailed pictures of organs and tissues. During the scan, the subject lies on a table in&#xd;
a narrow cylinder containing a magnetic field. He or she can speak with a staff member&#xd;
via an intercom system at all times during the procedure.&#xd;
&#xd;
Healthy dental patients recruited through the NIH Clinical Research Volunteer Program may&#xd;
enroll in this study. Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures in two&#xd;
clinic visits:&#xd;
&#xd;
Visit 1 - Sensitivity Testing&#xd;
&#xd;
Participants are tested for sensitivity to warm and hot temperatures. A probe is applied&#xd;
to the skin (usually the forearm) and heated to temperatures ranging from room&#xd;
temperature to that of a hot cup of coffee. Participants rate the temperature using a&#xd;
scale ranging from "no pain" to the "worst pain imaginable" and rate the unpleasantness&#xd;
of the heat using a similar scale. The probe is applied up to 30 times, using random heat&#xd;
intensities. Participants are also asked compare the heat intensity to varying levels of&#xd;
sounds and to rate the magnitude of different sensations they have experienced in the&#xd;
past, such as the brightness of the sun and the loudness of a jet plane. A blood sample&#xd;
of about 2 ounces is also collected at this visit for DNA analysis to look for genes&#xd;
related to pain.&#xd;
&#xd;
Visit 2 - Oral Surgery&#xd;
&#xd;
Under local anesthetic, participants undergo extraction of their lower right wisdom&#xd;
tooth. After surgery, the patient is moved to the MRI scanner for brain imaging over 1-2&#xd;
hours while the local anesthetic wears off. Patients may request a postoperative pain&#xd;
drug (Toradol) during the procedure, if needed. When the scan is complete, patients are&#xd;
dismissed from the clinic with additional pain medication (flurbiprofen) to use at home&#xd;
as directed.</textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>Functional neuroimaging provides a powerful tool for understanding how the brain may be&#xd;
involved in the perception of pain. It has made it possible to identify areas of the&#xd;
brain that are involved in the perception of experimental pain but very few studies have&#xd;
evaluated the sites in the brain that are activated during clinical pain and the effects&#xd;
of analgesic drugs. The proposed study will use the surgical removal of an impacted third&#xd;
molar as a model of acute clinical pain to identify sites that are activated following&#xd;
the offset of local anesthesia and to examine the effects of the NSAID analgesic&#xd;
ketorolac on attenuating sites that are activated as pain is relieved. Scans will be&#xd;
performed under non-pain baseline conditions, and again immediately following surgery as&#xd;
the local anesthetic wears off, clinical pain occurs, and following administration of the&#xd;
NSAID ketorolac. Differences among subjects in the amount of pain reported and brain&#xd;
activation will be compared to subjects' prior ratings of experimental pain and the&#xd;
presence of any genetic polymorphisms that are related to pain perception, inflammation,&#xd;
known pain pathways, or psychological factors related to pain. The findings from this&#xd;
research may help to reveal how pain is appreciated in the central nervous system,&#xd;
pharmacologically modified by NSAID analgesics and differs among individuals due to&#xd;
genetic factors.</textblock>

&#xd;
Subjects will be a convenience sample selected from the pool of 500 - 700 new patients&#xd;
screened annually for acute pain studies. Inclusion and Exclusion criteria will be&#xd;
applied to result in a homogeneous population of subjects with respect to the surgical&#xd;
difficulty of the tooth being extracted, a single lower right third molar.</textblock>
