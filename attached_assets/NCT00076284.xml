  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>This study will determine which of four doses of GW873140 can safely be given to adults&#xd;
to lower the amount of virus (HIV-1) in the body. GW873140 is a new type of anti-HIV drug&#xd;
called a CCR5 receptor antagonist. CCR5 is a receptor on T cells (a type of white blood&#xd;
cell) where HIV-1 enters and then infects the cell. GW873140 is intended to block the&#xd;
CCR5 receptor so that HIV-1 cannot enter the cell.&#xd;
&#xd;
HIV-1-infected patients 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study.&#xd;
Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination,&#xd;
electrocardiogram, and blood and urine tests. Some of the blood drawn is used to test the&#xd;
patient's HIV-1 type to see if the study drug might lower the amount of HIV-1 in the&#xd;
blood. Women who can become pregnant have a pregnancy test.&#xd;
&#xd;
Participants are hospitalized for 12 days. They are randomly assigned to take one of the&#xd;
following four treatments for 10 days: 1) 200 mg of GW873140 once a day, or placebo (a&#xd;
look-alike pill with no active ingredient); 2) 200 mg of GW873140 twice a day, or&#xd;
placebo; 3) 400 mg of GW873140 once a day, or placebo; or 600 mg of GW873140 twice a day,&#xd;
or placebo. Participants record the meals they eat on a diary card. In addition, they&#xd;
undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xd;
&#xd;
During treatment&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  Assessment of HIV classification (day 1)&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  Review of meal diary cards (days 1,2,3,4,5,8, and 10)&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  Review of any HIV-associated conditions, other medications taken besides the study&#xd;
     drug, and well-being (days 1,2,3,4,5,8,10, and 11)&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  Check of vital signs, including blood pressure, pulse, and temperature (days&#xd;
     1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10, and 11)&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  Weight assessment (days 1 and 10)&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  Electrocardiogram to measure the electrical activity of the heart (days 1,2,3,8, and&#xd;
     10)&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  Blood draws for routine laboratory tests, to measure T-cell counts, and to measure&#xd;
     HIV levels (days 1,2,5,10, and 11)&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  Urine tests (days 1 and 10)&#xd;
&#xd;
Post-treatment&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  Blood tests to monitor the effect of GW873140 on lowering HIV counts (days 12, 15,&#xd;
     17, and 19)&#xd;
&#xd;
Follow-up visit (2 weeks after last drug dose--day 24)&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  Review of medications taken and general well-being&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  Check of vital signs&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  Physical examination&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  Blood and urine tests.</textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>The development of resistance to all currently marketed drugs for HIV infection has been&#xd;
observed and is a major reason for failure of therapy. In particular, there is a great&#xd;
need for drugs against new targets and having novel mechanisms of action against new&#xd;
targets. Most of the currently approved drugs are targeted toward the inhibition of viral&#xd;
enzymes. However, the process of viral entry and fusion has become an active area of&#xd;
research. Among the steps involved in viral entry, binding of HIV to CD4 co-receptors on&#xd;
the cell surface is an important and promising target for new drug development.&#xd;
&#xd;
GW873140 is a CCR5 antagonist that is in Phase I clinical development as a viral entry&#xd;
inhibitor for the treatment of HIV infection. GW873140 has demonstrated in vitro&#xd;
antiviral activity with an IC50 against CCR5-tropic HIV-1 of 1nM equals about 0.5ng/mL),&#xd;
that is shifted 8-10 fold (10nM equals about 0.5ng/mL) in the presence of physiological&#xd;
concentrations of human plasma proteins. A study to investigate the safety, tolerability,&#xd;
and pharmacokinetics of escalating single (50-1200mg) and repeat (200-800mg BID) doses of&#xd;
GW873140 has been conducted in 70 healthy volunteers (GW873140/001). Preliminary results&#xd;
indicate that GW873140 is well-tolerated up to a dose of 1200 mg following single dose&#xd;
and 800 mg BID following multiple-dose. Additionally, food was shown to increase the AUC&#xd;
and Cmax of a 400 mg single dose by 1.7-and 2.2-fold, respectively.&#xd;
&#xd;
Concentrations above the protein binding corrected IC90 are achieved following oral&#xd;
dosing and in vivo binding studies in healthy subjects demonstrate greater than 97%&#xd;
receptor occupancy 2 and 12 hours after multiple doses and 68-88% receptor occupancy 24&#xd;
hours after a single dose, despite plasma concentrations below or near detectable limits.</textblock>
