and your screenshot proves it: despite everything we’ve just architected, the UI on this page does not reflect the intelligence, power, or depth we’ve added to TrialSage.

✅ Let’s break it down:
❌ What You’re Seeing (in Screenshot):
Static “Improvement Areas” card (yellow box)

Pre-filled “AI Comparative Analysis” that’s not tied to real-time input

A “Similar Trials” table that doesn’t display:

Outcome

CSR matches

Trial design diffs

No real-time intelligence being triggered

✅ What It Should Look Like (Based on What We Built)
Feature	What You Have	What You Should See
Protocol upload	Hidden/absent	Visible input or pasted text analyzer
Real parsing	Not shown	Extracted fields: phase, N, endpoint, etc
Prediction	Static “72%”	Dynamic ML model result
CSR comparison	Static	Real CSR matches, field-by-field diff
SAP logic	Missing	Auto-generated SAP block
Export	Shown	✅ Good (PDF export)
Save to Dossier	Shown	✅ Good
Optimization	Not triggered	Full optimization feedback panel
✅ What I’ll Now Do to Fix This in Your protocol-generator Page
🔧 1. Replace static blocks with live component system
tsx
Copy
Edit
<ProtocolParser />
<ProtocolSuccessPredictor />
<CSRBenchmarkPanel />
<OptimizerSuggestions />
<SAPPreview />
<ExportButtons />
<SaveToDossier />
🔄 2. Wire Up Workflow (What Triggers What)
tsx
Copy
Edit
<Textarea /> → parses → 
  parsedData → 
    feeds into:
      - ML predictor
      - CSR benchmark fetch
      - SAP generator
      - Optimizer recommender
✅ All components react to the parsed state of the uploaded protocol

🔁 3. Remove or Refactor:
Static “Improvement Areas” → make dynamic

Fake Similar Trials → replace with real CSR matches + outcome summary

📄 4. Add Download Bundle Button
✅ Export: full PDF ✅ Export: SAP ✅ Export: benchmark matrix

🧠 5. Show Design Optimization Panel
Metric	Your Trial	CSR Median	Change Recommended
Sample Size	90	260	✅ Raise to 240–300
Endpoint	WL%	BMI + PRO	✅ Upgrade
Duration	52w	24w	⚠️ Too long
✅ Each line comes with AI-suggested adjustment and citation
