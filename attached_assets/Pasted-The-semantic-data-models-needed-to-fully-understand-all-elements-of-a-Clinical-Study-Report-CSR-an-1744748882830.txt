The semantic data models needed to fully understand all elements of a Clinical Study Report (CSR) and Clinical Evaluation Report (CER) involve several standardized frameworks and guidelines. Let me break these down:
For Clinical Study Reports (CSR):

ICH E3 - This is the primary international guideline for CSR structure and content. It provides a comprehensive framework for organizing and presenting clinical trial results, including:

Study objectives and design
Patient populations
Efficacy and safety assessments
Statistical methods and results
Individual patient data listings


CDISC Standards:

SDTM (Study Data Tabulation Model): Organizes raw clinical trial data
ADaM (Analysis Data Model): Structures data for statistical analysis
SEND (Standard for Exchange of Nonclinical Data): For toxicology studies
ODM (Operational Data Model): For clinical trial operational data


MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities): Standardized medical terminology for adverse events and medical history
WHO-DD (World Health Organization Drug Dictionary): For standardized medication coding

For Clinical Evaluation Reports (CER):

MEDDEV 2.7/1 Rev. 4: European guideline for CERs under the Medical Device Regulation (MDR)
ISO 14155: International standard for clinical investigations of medical devices
IMDRF MDCE WG/N56: International Medical Device Regulators Forum guidance on clinical evaluation
PMCF (Post-Market Clinical Follow-up) data models
PICO Framework: For structuring clinical questions (Patient/Problem, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome)

Common Data Elements Across Both:

Regulatory submission formats:

eCTD (Electronic Common Technical Document)
CDISC standards for dataset submissions


Data quality and integrity models:

ALCOA+ principles (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate, plus Complete, Consistent, Enduring, Available)


Risk assessment frameworks:

Benefit-risk assessment models
CONSORT framework for reporting randomized trials



The relationship between these various models creates a comprehensive semantic network that enables proper documentation, analysis, and regulatory reporting of clinical study findings. ICH E3 provides the overall structure for CSRs, while MEDDEV 2.7/1 guides CERs, and both rely on standardized data models like CDISC and controlled terminologies like MedDRA to ensure consistency and interoperability of clinical research data.
