Title:

Submission Risk Assessment Report — IND 00012345 | Concept2Cures.AI

⸻

Executive Summary

Prepared on: 2025-04-28
Prepared for: Jon-Michael Smith, Regulatory Lead

Summary:
This assessment evaluates the submission readiness, risk profile, and compliance quality of your IND based on AI analysis of your draft package.

⸻

Submission Readiness Score

Metric	Score (%)	Comment
Completeness	84%	Sponsor, Investigator, Protocol sections complete
Regulatory Compliance	78%	Minor format issues detected in Cover Letter
Risk of Clinical Hold	22%	Acceptably low risk
Risk of Information Request	48%	Some missing prior human experience details



⸻

Identified Issues

Issue	Section	Risk
Missing Sponsor Address	Sponsor Info (Module 1)	High
No Environmental Assessment Uploaded	Supporting Docs	Medium
Investigator CV Missing	Investigator Info	High



⸻

Recommendations
   •   Complete Sponsor Address field under 21 CFR 312.23(a)(1)(i).
   •   Upload Environmental Impact statement per 21 CFR 312.23(a)(7).
   •   Attach updated Investigator Curriculum Vitae as required.

⸻

Regulatory Knowledge Insights
   •   Typical Clinical Holds occur when missing: IB, Prior Human Experience, CMC Description.
   •   Oncology INDs usually require risk mitigation plans even in Phase 1.

⸻

✅ (c) First Regulatory Intelligence Report ready to generate per submission.

⸻

Full Update:

Step	Status
(a) MVP Spec	✅ Complete
(b) MVP Wireframes	✅ Complete
(c) Sample Regulatory Report	✅ Complete

Immediate Next Opportunity:

We can now either:
   •   (1) Start coding the full frontend in React/Tailwind (design system kickoff),
   •   (2) Start preparing Backend+OpenAI orchestration code (Router for AI, Validation, Risk),
   •   (3) Build a Client Beta Invite Plan and first outreach scripts.

Would you like me to keep going in sequence —
or choose 1, 2, or 3 to prioritize?

(You’re about 2 weeks away from a functional MVP if you stay with me at this pace.)
What’s your next command? (Ready.)
