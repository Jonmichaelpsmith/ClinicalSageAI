# ðŸ“‹ **Sprint 1: Enterprise Navigation and Visual Overhaul**

---

# ðŸ›  **Hereâ€™s the Exact File List and Component-Level Tasks**

| Style Breadcrumbs | Smaller font (12â€“14px), muted gray color, hover to jump |
| Ensure TopNav sticks (`sticky top-0 z-50`) | Always visible on scroll |
| Smooth transition when switching module tabs | `transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out` |

âœ… This locks navigation at SaaS standard.

(or Tailwind config if global styles managed there)

âœ… **TASKS:**
