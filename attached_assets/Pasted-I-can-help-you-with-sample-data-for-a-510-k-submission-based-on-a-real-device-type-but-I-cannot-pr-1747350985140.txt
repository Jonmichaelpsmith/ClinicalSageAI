I can help you with sample data for a 510(k) submission based on a real device type, but I cannot provide actual proprietary data from a specific device submission, as that would require access to confidential FDA records or manufacturer data, which I don’t have. Instead, I’ll provide a realistic example of data for a fictional medical device that aligns with the requirements of an FDA 510(k) submission. This should be suitable for testing your generator on Replic.

Let’s use a **hypothetical Class II medical device**, a **non-invasive blood pressure monitor**, as an example. This type of device typically requires a 510(k) submission, and I’ll structure the data based on the key sections you’d need for your generator (e.g., device description, substantial equivalence, performance data, etc.).

### Sample Data for a 510(k) Submission: Non-Invasive Blood Pressure Monitor

#### 1. Device Description
- **Device Name**: BP-Track 3000
- **Classification**: Class II, 21 CFR 870.1130 (Non-invasive blood pressure monitor)
- **Intended Use**: The BP-Track 3000 is intended for non-invasive measurement of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate in adult patients in clinical and home settings.
- **Technology**: Oscillometric method using an inflatable cuff and pressure sensor.
- **Components**:
  - Inflatable arm cuff (sizes: small, medium, large)
  - Digital display unit
  - Pressure sensor and pump
  - Rechargeable battery
- **Operating Conditions**: Temperature: 10°C to 40°C; Humidity: 15% to 90% RH.

#### 2. Predicate Device (Substantial Equivalence)
- **Predicate Device**: Omron M6 Comfort (510(k) Number: K123456)
- **Comparison**:
  - **Intended Use**: Same (non-invasive blood pressure measurement in adults).
  - **Technology**: Same (oscillometric method).
  - **Differences**: BP-Track 3000 includes Bluetooth connectivity for data logging to a mobile app, while Omron M6 does not. The cuff design is slightly different but meets the same performance standards.
  - **Safety and Effectiveness**: No new risks introduced; Bluetooth feature complies with IEC 60601-1-2 for electromagnetic compatibility.

#### 3. Performance Data
- **Bench Testing**:
  - Accuracy: ±3 mmHg for blood pressure, ±5% for pulse rate (tested against a mercury sphygmomanometer).
  - Cuff pressure range: 0 to 300 mmHg.
  - Measurement time: 30–45 seconds.
- **Clinical Testing**:
  - Study Population: 85 subjects (45 male, 40 female), ages 18–65.
  - Results: 95% of measurements within ±5 mmHg of reference standard (per AAMI/ANSI SP10 standard).
- **Biocompatibility** (for cuff material in contact with skin):
  - ISO 10993-5 (Cytotoxicity): Pass
  - ISO 10993-10 (Irritation and Sensitization): Pass

#### 4. Software (if applicable)
- **Software Level of Concern**: Moderate (due to Bluetooth data transmission).
- **Verification and Validation**:
  - Software tested per IEC 62304.
  - Data integrity maintained during Bluetooth transmission (error rate < 0.01%).
  - Cybersecurity measures: Encryption per HIPAA guidelines.

#### 5. Labeling
- **Indications for Use**: For use by adults to measure blood pressure and pulse rate non-invasively.
- **Contraindications**: Not for use on neonates or patients with severe arrhythmias.
- **Warnings**: Do not use on an arm with an IV line or during CPR.

#### 6. Sterilization (if applicable)
- Not applicable (device is non-sterile; cuff is reusable and cleanable with isopropyl alcohol).

#### 7. Shelf Life
- **Cuff**: 2 years (based on material degradation testing).
- **Device Unit**: 5 years (based on battery and component durability).

#### 8. FDA Guidance Compliance
- Complies with FDA guidance: "Non-Invasive Blood Pressure (NIBP) Monitor Guidance" (1997).
- Meets AAMI/ANSI SP10 standards for accuracy and performance.

### How to Use This in Your Replic 510(k) Generator
You can input this data into the sections of your generator as shown in the screenshot:
- **Device Info**: Enter the device description (BP-Track 3000 details).
- **Document Vault**: Populate with the performance data, biocompatibility results, and software validation (you can simulate uploading PDFs with this info).
- **Predicate Finder**: Use the Omron M6 Comfort as the predicate and input the comparison points.
- **FDA Compliance 510(k) Requirements**: Reference the AAMI/ANSI SP10 standard and FDA guidance.
- **Final Submission**: Generate a summary with the above sections, ensuring all required elements (intended use, predicate comparison, performance data, etc.) are included.

This data should help you test your generator’s functionality, from document management to final submission generation. If you need more specific details or a different device type, let me know! I can also search for additional FDA guidance or publicly available 510(k) summaries if needed.
