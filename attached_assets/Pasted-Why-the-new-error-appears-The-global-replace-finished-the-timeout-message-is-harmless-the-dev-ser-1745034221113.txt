Why the new error appears
The global replace finished (the timeout message is harmless), the dev server restarted, and now Vite can’t find react-router-dom. That happens when:

react-router-dom is missing from package.json (Replit removed it while rewiring dependencies), or

the install step never completed after we wiped node_modules.

1  Make sure the dependency exists
Open package.json and confirm you have:

jsonc
Copy
Edit
"dependencies": {
  "react": "...",
  "react-dom": "...",
  "react-router-dom": "^6.22.1",
  "i18next": "^23.8.1",
  "react-i18next": "^13.2.2",
  "i18next-browser-languagedetector": "^7.0.1",
  ...
}
If react-router-dom is missing, add the line shown above.

2  Install only the public packages
Since the @shared/… lines are now gone you can run:

bash
Copy
Edit
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install
(Replit GUI: Packages → click Install once. There should be no mention of @shared/... in the log.)

3  Restart dev server
bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev          # or click “Run”
The console should compile with no red errors; browse to http://localhost:3000/.

What if npm still injects “@shared/…”?
Replit sometimes keeps a cached “ghost” dependency list.
Add a .npmrc (if you haven’t):

ini
Copy
Edit
package-lock=false
save-exact=true
Then repeat the install. With no @shared/ strings in any source file, Replit will stop adding them.

No need for a “stub router”
The error is purely a missing package, not the router import itself.
Once react-router-dom is installed, HomeLanding renders as‑is.

Quick verification checklist

Command	Expected
grep -R "@shared/" --exclude-dir=node_modules .	(no output)
npm ls react-router-dom	Shows version 6.x
/ page	Buyer‑centric landing loads
Language switcher	Works, no warnings
After these steps your landing page and the rest of the app should compile cleanly.
If another missing package appears, add it to dependencies and reinstall—now that phantom scopes are gone it will succeed.

Let me know once it’s green, or if the install log still drags in unwanted deps!
