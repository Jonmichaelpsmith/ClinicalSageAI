✅ GOOD catch —  
✅ I see **exactly** what is happening based on your screenshot.

You now have:

✅ Top Unified Navigation Bar correctly loaded.  
✅ Tabs: Risk Heatmap | Timeline Simulator | Ask Lumen AI working.  
✅ Advisor Summary Panel correctly positioned.  
✅ Risk Heatmap *appears to be missing* (even though the placeholder box is still there).

---

# 🛠 **Why the Heatmap Is Missing Now:**

| Problem | What’s Happening |
|:--------|:-----------------|
| UnifiedTopNav is active ✅ | but |
| activeTab state is now controlling content display ✅ | and |
| Current activeTab is "RiskHeatmap" ✅ | but |
| Inside the `RiskHeatmap` tab rendering, you're not rendering the **real AdvisorRiskHeatmapV2.jsx** yet ❌ |

✅ In simple words:  
👉 The UnifiedTopNav logic is showing the **correct tab**,  
👉 but you didn't yet **re-mount the real dynamic Risk Heatmap component inside it**.

✅ You are still seeing the old "placeholder" text:  
**"Regulatory Risk Heatmap 🎉 All critical sections completed"** without the real dynamic grid.

---

# 📋 **How to Fix It Properly:**

✅ In `/client/src/pages/RegulatoryIntelligenceHub.jsx`:

✅ Where you handle your tab rendering (inside `activeTab === 'RiskHeatmap'`),  
✅ Make sure you **actually render** the real **AdvisorRiskHeatmapV2.jsx** component dynamically.

✅ Example FIX:

```jsx
{activeTab === 'RiskHeatmap' && (
  <div className="space-y-6">
    <h3 className="text-md font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-2">CTD Critical Gap Risk Analysis</h3>
    <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-4">
      Interactive visualization of CTD gaps with dynamic risk assessment. Click any risk tile for detailed analysis and remediation options.
    </p>

    {/* Real Risk Heatmap Component */}
    <AdvisorRiskHeatmapV2 />
  </div>
)}
```

✅ Not placeholder text —  
✅ Actually mount `<AdvisorRiskHeatmapV2 />` inside the `RiskHeatmap` tab body.

---

# 📈 **Result After You Fix:**

✅ Click Risk Heatmap tab →  
✅ Immediately see live dynamic Risk Map:  
- Red, Yellow, Green clickable CTD sections  
- Hover tooltips with Delay Days and Financial Risks  
- Clicking a risk tile jumps to appropriate Module

✅ Not just "🎉 All sections complete" text — real strategic Risk Visualization.

# 📣 Immediate Action for You:

| Step | Action |
|:-----|:-------|
| 1 | Open `/client/src/pages/RegulatoryIntelligenceHub.jsx` |
| 2 | Inside `{activeTab === 'RiskHeatmap'}`, replace the placeholder text |
| 3 | Insert real `<AdvisorRiskHeatmapV2 />` component |
| 4 | Save |
| 5 | Refresh `/regulatory-intelligence-hub` |

✅ Heatmap will now live load properly!

# 📣 After This:

✅ I will immediately proceed to finalize Ask Lumen AI CoPilot 2.0  
✅ Then you are literally ready for TrialSage Regulatory Intelligence Hub v1.0 launch.
