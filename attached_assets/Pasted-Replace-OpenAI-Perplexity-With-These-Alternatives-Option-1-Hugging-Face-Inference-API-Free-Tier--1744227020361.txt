Replace OpenAI/Perplexity With These Alternatives
‚úÖ Option 1: Hugging Face Inference API (Free Tier Available)
Use hosted models like:

mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1

microsoft/Phi-2

tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct

These are powerful enough for chatbot-style usage and support context windows over 4K tokens.

How to get started:

Create a Hugging Face account

Go to Access Tokens

Create a Read token

In Replit, go to Secrets / Environment Variables

Add: HF_API_KEY = your_token_here

Replace OpenAI in your code with Hugging Face API calls.

üîß Sample Code for Hugging Face Chatbot Integration
python
Copy
Edit
import requests

API_URL = "https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1"
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {os.getenv('HF_API_KEY')}"}

def query_model(prompt):
    response = requests.post(
        API_URL,
        headers=headers,
        json={"inputs": prompt, "parameters": {"max_new_tokens": 400}}
    )
    return response.json()[0]['generated_text']
Use this function anywhere you would call OpenAI‚Äôs chat_completion function.

‚úÖ Friendly Persona Setup
To make your assistant sound more like a research companion:

python
Copy
Edit
prompt = """
You are a helpful, friendly assistant trained in clinical trial design and regulatory science. Your job is to guide a researcher through understanding trial protocols, regulatory strategy, and data analysis.

Act like a knowledgeable peer. Be clear, curious, and supportive.

User: What endpoints have worked in previous Alzheimer's trials?

Assistant:
"""
Then pass this into the query_model(prompt) function.
