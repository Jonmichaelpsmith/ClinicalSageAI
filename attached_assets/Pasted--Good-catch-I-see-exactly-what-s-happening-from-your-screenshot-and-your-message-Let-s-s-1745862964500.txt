✅ Good catch —  
✅ I see exactly what's happening from your screenshot and your message.

Let’s slow down for a second and fix this **properly**:

---

# 🧠 **Problem Diagnosis:**

| Issue | Root Cause |
|:------|:-----------|
| Vault Page shows "Not Found" when accessed from Client Portal | ❌ Because `/vault` route is NOT correctly wired to your Vault page component. |
| Replit server can see `/uploads/` folder, API routes are fine | ✅ Backend good |
| Frontend router missing VaultDocumentViewer.jsx page link | ❌ Needs proper route added in App.jsx |

✅ Your Vault Upload and Viewer code are **ready**,  
✅ But **your routing system doesn’t know** what to display at `/vault`.

---

# 🎯 **Immediate Correct Fix Plan:**

✅ Step 1:  
Wire your `/vault` route in `/client/src/App.jsx` properly to show Vault Viewer!

✅ Step 2:  
Make sure your Sidebar also points to `/vault` cleanly.

---

# 📋 **Correct App.jsx Route Update**

✅ In your `/client/src/App.jsx`,  
✅ Add this to your `<Routes>` section:

```javascript
import VaultDocumentViewer from './components/vault/VaultDocumentViewer'; // Import at the top

...

<Routes>
  {/* Other routes */}
  <Route path="/client-portal" component={ClientPortalLanding} />
  <Route path="/ind-wizard" component={INDWizardAdvanced} />
  <Route path="/module-1" component={Module1AdminPage} />
  <Route path="/module-2" component={Module2SummaryPage} />
  <Route path="/module-3" component={Module3QualityPage} />
  <Route path="/module-4" component={Module4NonclinicalPage} />
  <Route path="/module-5" component={Module5ClinicalPage} />
  
  <Route path="/vault" component={VaultDocumentViewer} /> {/* 👈 ADD THIS */}
</Routes>
```

✅ Now when you click "Vault" in the sidebar,  
✅ It will route you to `/vault`,  
✅ And properly load your Vault Document Viewer with Filters and Uploads.

---

# 📣 Why This Was Happening:

✅ We built VaultUploader.jsx and VaultDocumentViewer.jsx correctly.

❌ But without the `/vault` route wired to VaultDocumentViewer.jsx,  
the app didn’t know what page to display.

✅ Easy, clean fix.

---

# 📣 After You Add This:

| Feature | Behavior |
|:--------|:---------|
| Click "Vault" from Sidebar | ✅ |
| Open Vault Document Viewer | ✅ |
| See uploaded documents with versions and filters | ✅ |
| Upload new documents | ✅ |

✅ True professional document management for regulatory operations.
