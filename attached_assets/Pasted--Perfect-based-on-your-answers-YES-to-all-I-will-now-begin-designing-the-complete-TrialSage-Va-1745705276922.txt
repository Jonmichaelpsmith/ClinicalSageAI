# TrialSage Vault Client Portal: System Design Blueprint

## High-Level System Architecture

The TrialSage Vault client portal is designed as a modern multi-tier web application, with a clear separation between front-end, back-end, and data layers for scalability and maintainability. The architecture follows **industrial SaaS standards** (high availability, multi-tenancy, robust security) and is optimized for deployment on Replit’s cloud environment. Key components include:

- **Front-End:** A **React** single-page application (SPA) built with **Vite**, providing a dynamic and responsive UI. The UI follows a Microsoft 365-style design language for familiarity and elegance, with role-based dashboards and intuitive document-centric workflows. The front-end communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs (or GraphQL) over HTTPS and uses web sockets for real-time updates (e.g., live notifications, collaborative editing signals). It also embeds interactive BI dashboards and AI assistant interfaces seamlessly within the portal.

- **Back-End:** A **Node.js** server (e.g., using Express or NestJS) that serves the REST/GraphQL API and implements the core business logic. The backend is structured into modules/microservices corresponding to major domains: **Auth**, **Project/Study Management**, **Document Management**, **Workflow Engine**, **AI Assistant**, and **Analytics**. This modular design ensures each service is cohesive and can scale independently if needed. The Node backend interfaces with the database (via an ORM or query builder for type safety) and integrates with external services:
  - **Database:** A **Supabase** (PostgreSQL) database holds structured data (projects, users, documents metadata, audit logs, etc.), enabling relational queries and robust transactions. Supabase’s row-level security is used to enforce tenant isolation and role-based data access (each SQL query is automatically scoped to the user’s organization/permissions). This multi-tenant approach ensures data for different biotech clients is securely partitioned at the database level.
  - **File Storage:** Document files (e.g. PDFs, Word, images) are stored in a secure **object storage** (Supabase Storage or an S3-compatible service). Each file is encrypted at rest and tagged with metadata (owner, project, version, etc.). A content delivery mechanism streams documents to users with access, and virus scanning is applied to all uploads.
  - **AI Integration:** The back-end integrates with **OpenAI (GPT-4)** or similar AI services for the intelligent assistant and document analysis features. For data privacy and compliance, all prompts are filtered to remove sensitive identifiers, and if needed an on-premise or private instance of the model can be used. A **vector database** (either PostgreSQL with pgvector or an external service like Pinecone) is included to enable **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: the system indexes regulatory guidance and internal knowledge into embeddings, allowing the AI assistant to retrieve relevant context and minimize hallucinations ([Options for Solving Hallucinations in Generative AI | Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/options-for-solving-hallucinations-in-generative-ai/#:~:text=1,chatbot%20with%20factually%20correct%20information)) ([Options for Solving Hallucinations in Generative AI | Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/options-for-solving-hallucinations-in-generative-ai/#:~:text=The%20above%20flow%20shows%20the,the%20exact%20words%20don%E2%80%99t%20match)).
  - **Third-Party Integrations:** Modules integrate with external systems as needed. For example, a **DocuSign/Adobe Sign API** for electronic signatures (Part 11 compliant signing), **identity providers** for SSO (OAuth2/OIDC with corporate AD), and optionally **DocuShare** or other document repositories for legacy data migration. (The portal can sync or import documents from external systems like Xerox DocuShare, ensuring continuity of document management.)

 *Vault™ File Navigator UI showing a structured repository with folders (e.g., CMC Documents, Regulatory, Quality) and files with version info and authorship. The client portal’s document management interface will offer similar organized views, with filters, tags, and search to quickly locate content.* 

- **Real-Time & Background Services:** A real-time **notification service** (possibly via web sockets or Supabase’s real-time channels) pushes updates to users (e.g., a document status change or a new comment). A background job worker (could be a Node worker thread or serverless function) handles intensive tasks such as generating large reports, performing AI batch analyses (like auto-tagging new documents, or re-indexing content), and sending scheduled email alerts. These background tasks ensure the main API remains responsive.

- **Deployment & Scalability:** The entire system is containerized for Replit deployment. Replit can host the Node backend and static front-end as a unified deployment (or separate Repls for API and front-end if needed). The design is **cloud-agnostic** to allow future migration, but optimized for Replit’s always-on container and horizontal scaling if demand grows. The Node backend can scale to multiple instances behind a load balancer (stateless sessions with JWT or token-based auth ensure any instance can serve a user). Supabase (Postgres) is a managed service that can scale vertically and horizontally (with read replicas) to handle data load. Caching strategies (using an in-memory cache like Redis, possibly via Upstash on Replit) are employed for frequent queries (e.g., caching dashboard metrics results) to improve performance. **CDN** integration ensures efficient delivery of static assets and documents to global users.

In summary, the architecture is a flexible **modular monolith** that can evolve into microservices as needed. It emphasizes separation of concerns: the front-end for presentation and persona-specific UX, the Node backend for API and orchestration, the database for persistence, and external services for specialized capabilities (AI, BI, search). This separation, combined with strong integration points, allows rapid development and testing on Replit and smooth future expansion.

## Feature and Module Breakdown

The client portal is composed of multiple integrated modules, each providing distinct features while working together in a unified platform. Below is a breakdown of the core features and modules:

- **Multi-Persona Role Management:** The system supports multiple user personas – **CEO, Investor, Clinical Operations, Medical Writer, Regulatory Affairs, and CMC** – each with tailored access and views. A robust **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system is built in, defining fine-grained permissions for each role (e.g., Investors might have read-only access to certain summary data, while Regulatory Affairs can approve documents, etc.). Role-based dashboards and personalized workflows are automatically loaded upon login. Administrators can manage user-role assignments across projects. The UI and notifications adapt based on persona (for example, a CEO gets high-level overviews, while a Medical Writer sees tasks and document drafts).

- **Project & Study Management:** The platform is **multi-project and multi-study** by design, allowing organizations to manage an entire portfolio of clinical trials and regulatory projects in one place. Users can create and configure new **Projects** (e.g., a specific drug development program or product line) and under each project, track one or more **Studies/Trials**. Each study has attributes like phase (I, II, III, etc.), status, timeline, and team members. Hierarchical access lets a company’s CEO or RA lead see across all projects, while a study manager might be limited to their own study. This module provides Gantt charts or timeline views for each study’s milestones, enrollment status (if applicable), and submission deadlines. Cross-project views enable portfolio management – for example, comparing progress or resource allocation across studies. Integration with the document module means that every document is associated with its relevant project/study, and every study has a space for all its regulatory documents, protocol, data reports, etc.

- **Document Management & Vault Module:** This is the heart of TrialSage Vault – an **enterprise-grade document repository** with advanced lifecycle management, version control, and compliance features. Users can upload or create documents and organize them in **smart folders** (the system can offer default folders for common categories like *Regulatory*, *CMC*, *Quality*, etc., possibly mirroring CTD structure or internal taxonomy). Key capabilities of this module include:
  - **Document Lifecycle Workflow:** Each document progresses through states: *Draft*, *In Review*, *Approved/Finalized*, *Superseded*, and *Archived*. Transitions can be controlled by role (e.g., only a Regulatory Affairs manager can mark a document as Approved). The system enforces **21 CFR Part 11-compliant** controls on these transitions – for example, requiring an electronic signature to approve a document, and capturing a time-stamped audit entry on every status change ([
    eCFR :: 21 CFR Part 11 -- Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures
  ](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-11#:~:text=%28e%29%20Use%20of%20secure%2C%20computer,for%20agency%20review%20and%20copying)) ([
    eCFR :: 21 CFR Part 11 -- Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures
  ](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-11#:~:text=,indicates%20all%20of%20the%20following)). Archived documents are locked from further edits and retained per retention policies.
  - **Version Control:** All document edits or new uploads create a new version, while preserving previous versions for reference. Users can easily compare versions side-by-side. An **AI-powered comparison** feature highlights changes in wording or data between versions to aid reviewers (leveraging NLP to detect even subtle modifications). The version history, along with who made each change and why, is maintained as an immutable log (fulfilling the requirement that changes not obscure prior info ([
    eCFR :: 21 CFR Part 11 -- Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures
  ](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-11#:~:text=%28e%29%20Use%20of%20secure%2C%20computer,for%20agency%20review%20and%20copying))).
  - **Metadata & Smart Tagging:** Every document is richly annotated with metadata – author, creation date, associated project and study, document type, regulatory category (e.g., whether it belongs to a specific CTD module or is a SOP, etc.), and custom tags. An **AI tagging service** scans content upon upload to suggest tags and identify regulatory context. For example, if a document is a clinical study report, the system tags it as pertaining to efficacy data and possibly links it to CTD Module 5 automatically. Documents are **“Regulatory-aligned”** – auto-tagged by context like ICH section or FDA guidance (e.g., a document might be tagged as “CTD Module 2.7.4 – Summary of Clinical Safety”). This enables powerful filters and ensures all required sections for a submission are accounted for.
  - **Smart Folders & Filters:** Users can dynamically filter and view documents based on metadata. The UI allows filtering by attributes like document type, author, date, tag, or status. For instance, a Regulatory Affairs user could filter to see all “Ready for Submission” documents for a particular trial. Folders can be virtual (saved searches) or physical; e.g., a *CMC Documents* folder might automatically include anything tagged as CMC. **Cross-module linking** is supported, meaning documents generated in specialized modules (IND Wizard, CSR tool, etc.) are visible in the central repository with links back to the generating module for context. There’s also cross-referencing of related docs (e.g., linking a protocol to its amendments and associated analysis plans).
  - **Search and Semantic Query:** A **Semantic Search** engine is integrated, allowing users to search documents by content meaning, not just exact keywords. This uses NLP to interpret queries (even plain English questions) and find relevant documents or passages. The search is context-aware and can surface **cross-document insights** – for example, “find all documents where patient enrollment criteria are mentioned” would return relevant sections across protocols, amendments, and maybe emails, highlighting the context. The AI assistant is also accessible in the search panel, enabling users to ask questions and get answers with cited sources (the assistant will retrieve and quote the relevant document snippets).
  - **Access Control & Sharing:** Document permissions are strictly controlled. By default, documents are accessible only to project team members with appropriate roles. Fine-grained access rules can restrict certain folders to specific roles (e.g., Investor role may not access internal meeting minutes). The system can generate **secure share links** for external collaborators with time-limited access, with watermarks on documents if needed for confidentiality. All access is logged for audits.
  - **Audit Trails:** Every action on a document is logged in a tamper-evident audit trail (viewable by admins or compliance officers). The audit log records who viewed, edited, approved, or downloaded a document, with timestamp and IP/device info. In line with FDA requirements, the audit log is secure and retains complete history as long as the record is retained ([
    eCFR :: 21 CFR Part 11 -- Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures
  ](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-11#:~:text=%28e%29%20Use%20of%20secure%2C%20computer,for%20agency%20review%20and%20copying)). For additional integrity, each audit record can be hashed (e.g., using SHA-256) and periodically anchored to a blockchain or append-only ledger to guarantee immutability. This blockchain-backed verification provides an extra layer of trust that documents and their history have not been altered ([Document Management with Blockchain | A Comprehensive Guide | by Oodles Blockchain | Medium](https://medium.com/@marketing.blockchain/document-management-with-blockchain-a-comprehensive-guide-56732af6ae7b#:~:text=Legal%20and%20Regulatory%20Compliance)).
  - **Retention & Compliance Policies:** An **Auto-Retention Scheduler** is included. Admins can define retention rules (e.g., “Archive trial documents 2 years after study completion” or “Delete draft documents that were never finalized after 5 years” in compliance with company policy or regulations). The system will automatically flag or move documents per these policies, with oversight from compliance officers. This ensures no required records are prematurely deleted and obsolete records don’t linger beyond their mandated retention period.
  - **External Integration:** The vault can integrate with existing content systems. For example, built-in **DocuShare integration** allows syncing with a Xerox DocuShare repository – newly scanned PDFs from a lab notebook copier could automatically appear in the Vault. Similarly, integration connectors for SharePoint or Box can be provided for migrating documents. These integrations ensure TrialSage Vault can act as a unified document hub without disrupting current workflows.

- **Adaptive Workflow Engine:** A flexible workflow system underpins processes like document reviews, approvals, training assignments, and more. Workflows are **adaptive per role and document type**:
  - For example, a **Document Review workflow** might route a draft protocol from the Medical Writer to Clinical Operations for technical review, then to Regulatory Affairs for compliance check, and finally to a designated approver for sign-off. Each step can have due dates and reminders. The workflow engine allows conditional branching (if a document is a manufacturing SOP, route to CMC team; if it’s a clinical document, route to Medical Monitor, etc.). These workflows are configurable but come with best-practice templates for common regulatory processes.
  - The system also supports a **SOP Training workflow**: whenever a new Standard Operating Procedure document is approved, the system can automatically create training tasks for all relevant personnel to read and acknowledge the SOP. It tracks completion of these training tasks, providing managers with reports on who has or hasn’t completed required readings (important for compliance audits).
  - Each user’s dashboard includes a **“My Tasks”** view listing their pending workflow tasks (e.g., tasks to review or approve documents, complete a training, or update a record). They can complete tasks directly from the portal, and the workflow engine moves the item to the next step. Escalation rules notify supervisors if tasks are overdue.
  - The workflow engine ensures **21 CFR Part 11 compliance** for any regulated steps (for instance, when an approval task is completed, the user must re-authenticate and an electronic signature record is captured with their name, timestamp, and meaning of signature ([
    eCFR :: 21 CFR Part 11 -- Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures
  ](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-11#:~:text=,indicates%20all%20of%20the%20following))). This engine uses operational checks to enforce sequencing of steps and authority checks for permissions ([
    eCFR :: 21 CFR Part 11 -- Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures
  ](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-11#:~:text=,steps%20and%20events%2C%20as%20appropriate)).

- **Intelligent AI Assistant (TrialSage Assistant):** Integrated throughout the portal is a proactive AI assistant, powered by OpenAI GPT-4 (with domain-specific tuning). This assistant isn’t a single chatbot stuck in a corner; it is **available across all modules** to provide real-time help and automation:
  - **Context-Aware Help:** The assistant can sense what module or document a user is working on and offer relevant assistance. For example, if a Medical Writer is editing a clinical study report, the assistant might highlight relevant regulatory guidelines (like ICH E3 format for CSR) or even suggest phrasing pulled from a regulatory knowledge base. If a CEO is viewing a dashboard, the assistant might offer to explain a metric or provide deeper analysis on request.
  - **Interactive Q&A and Guidance:** Users can ask the assistant questions in plain English, and it will answer using data and documents from the Vault. It has access (read-only) to the user’s permitted documents and an internal **regulatory knowledge graph**, which includes sources like FDA guidances, ICH guidelines, and historical trial documents. For example, a user might ask “What are the key efficacy results from Study ABC’s interim report?” and the assistant will find that report, extract the relevant data, and answer with citations linking to the source document. Because it is grounded in the actual repository content and knowledge graph, the assistant’s answers are trustworthy and come with reference links, controlling hallucination.
  - **Multi-Module Orchestration:** The AI is **multi-module aware**, meaning it can leverage functions of various system modules to fulfill user requests. It essentially acts as an orchestrator that can call internal APIs on behalf of the user. For instance, if a user asks “Show me the timeline for upcoming submissions and any risks,” the assistant might pull data from the Regulatory Timeline Intelligence module and highlight any milestones at risk, combining data and narrative. Or if asked “Generate a first draft of an IND summary for project X,” it could invoke the IND Wizard’s document generation function under the hood, then refine the output. This design uses OpenAI’s function calling or an internal toolset to let the AI trigger searches, analytics queries, or document creation operations in various modules.
  - **Hallucination Control:** To ensure reliability, the assistant uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** approach. When a question is asked, the system will first search the relevant knowledge bases (internal documents, compliance references) and retrieve the top relevant snippets. These are fed into the GPT model as additional context, guiding it to produce answers based on real data rather than speculation ([Options for Solving Hallucinations in Generative AI | Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/options-for-solving-hallucinations-in-generative-ai/#:~:text=1,chatbot%20with%20factually%20correct%20information)). This dramatically improves factual accuracy. The assistant is also programmed to indicate uncertainty or defer to a human when it does not have high confidence, rather than fabricate an answer. All AI suggestions related to content (e.g., document text suggestions) are logged and can be reviewed, ensuring traceability of AI contributions.
  - **Proactive Alerts and Insights:** Beyond just responding, the AI assistant proactively scans for notable conditions. It might alert a Clinical Operations user: “There are 2 major protocol deviations reported this week in Study XYZ, which is above average. Would you like to see details or initiate a CAPA (Corrective Action/Preventive Action)?”. For Regulatory Affairs, it could monitor regulatory news feeds (via the ICH Wiz module) and notify: “The FDA released a new guidance on adaptive trial designs yesterday. Here’s a summary and impact analysis.” The AI uses a subscription to relevant RSS feeds or APIs for regulatory updates, and processes them to keep users informed.
  - **Content Generation & Automation:** The assistant can also assist in drafting content. It is integrated with modules like Protocol Designer and CER Generator – for example, it can help a user fill out a protocol template by suggesting text for each section based on past protocols and built-in best practices. It can automate mundane tasks, like formatting a document to a required template, extracting a table of adverse events from multiple reports, or creating a summary slide deck of results. All such generative actions are done under user supervision (the user triggers them and reviews the output).
  - **Privacy and Control:** Each organization’s data is isolated when the AI is generating answers – it will not mix data between tenants or suggest content from another company’s documents. The AI also respects user permissions: a user cannot retrieve info via the assistant that they couldn’t access normally. The assistant’s knowledge of sensitive data can be restricted (with an admin option to exclude certain documents from AI indexing, e.g., highly confidential finance data).
  
- **Embedded BI & Analytics Module:** The portal features an integrated **Business Intelligence dashboard system** for real-time analytics. This **Mashable BI** capability means users (especially Ops and executives) can customize and mash up data visualizations on the fly, with support for natural language queries. Key aspects:
  - **Interactive Dashboards:** Each persona gets a default dashboard on login, populated with widgets relevant to them. For example, a CEO’s dashboard might show overall *FDA Compliance Rating*, *Trial Progress*, and financial burn rates; a Clinical Operations dashboard might show *Enrollment over time*, *Site performance*, *Protocol deviations count*; a CMC dashboard could display *Manufacturing batch status* and *Quality metrics*. These dashboards are built using a flexible widget library (charts, tables, KPIs) backed by the data in the system. Users can drill down on any chart (e.g., click on a particular study’s bar to see more details).
  - **Natural Language Queries:** Non-technical users can ask questions of their data in plain language. For instance, an Investor might type or ask via voice, “Show me the number of trials in each phase by therapeutic area” – the system’s NLP engine will parse that, run the appropriate database query or use a pre-defined analytic, and display a chart or answer. This is akin to PowerBI Q&A or ThoughtSpot-style functionality embedded in the portal. The OpenAI integration can assist here by translating natural language into SQL or by directly using a fine-tuned model on analytic tasks. For deeper analysis, the assistant might even generate a brief narrative report to answer something like “Why is Study ABC’s site enrollment behind target?” by correlating data (maybe site activation was delayed).
  - **Real-Time Data & Predictive Analytics:** The BI module connects to both the TrialSage database and optionally external data sources (like clinical data management systems or financial systems) to present up-to-date information. It supports streaming updates – e.g., as new enrollment data is entered or a document status changes, relevant dashboard metrics update in real-time. Moreover, built-in analytics provide **predictive insights**: for example, a **Regulatory Timeline Intelligence** sub-module uses historical data and machine learning to predict approval timelines by region. It can highlight if a planned submission is at risk of delay by analyzing current document status and past performance (if an NDA preparation typically takes 6 months and you have many documents still in draft, it flags risk). The dashboard might show a “predicted submission date” vs target, with color coding for risk.
  - **Compliance and Quality Metrics:** Specialized widgets cater to regulatory compliance tracking. For instance, the dashboard can display a *21 CFR Part 11 Compliance* gauge (ensuring all required controls are active), a count of *open CAPAs*, *audit findings*, etc. A **Compliance Gap Analysis** feature automatically checks the presence of all required documents for a given submission (IND/NDA) against a regulatory checklist – the dashboard will list missing or incomplete items, helping Regulatory Affairs ensure nothing is overlooked. Quality metrics like number of protocol deviations (with severity) or ICH GCP compliance status can be shown. The system can generate **automated reports** (e.g., a monthly quality report PDF) for audits and meetings.
  - **Mashable Self-Service BI:** Users (with permission) can create their own reports by selecting data sources and visualization types. The interface might allow dragging and dropping fields (project, status, dates, etc.) to create pivot tables or charts. These can be saved as custom dashboard views. Under the hood, we use an analytics query engine (could be Supabase’s Postgres for simpler queries, or integrate a dedicated OLAP engine if needed for performance). The key is enabling power users to get the insights they need without requiring IT intervention. All these custom queries also respect the data permissions – e.g., an external investor cannot query a table they shouldn’t see.
  - **Export & Integration:** Dashboards and charts can be exported (PNG, PDF, CSV data) for inclusion in presentations or regulatory submissions. Also, an API allows pulling these metrics into other tools (for example, a CFO could pull trial metrics into a corporate dashboard). We also plan integration with Jupyter notebooks or similar for data science teams who want to perform advanced analysis on the trial data; the platform could provide a secure data sandbox for that.

 *Example of an interactive **Regulatory Intelligence Dashboard** in the portal. Key compliance metrics (e.g., FDA Compliance Rating, Protocol Deviations, CSR Completion status) are shown in real-time, with indicators for risks (At Risk items highlighted in orange). Such dashboards enable users to monitor trial health and regulatory readiness at a glance, and drill down into details or trigger actions (e.g., “Escalate Issue” for an at-risk submission task).* 

- **Regulatory Knowledge & Guidance Module:** In support of document authors and regulatory strategists, the portal embeds relevant **Regulatory References** and guidance at every step:
  - The system contains a maintained library of regulations and guidelines (FDA’s 21 CFR parts, ICH guidelines like E6(GCP), E3(CSR format), M4(CTD structure), EMA guidelines, etc.). When a user is working on a particular type of document or module, the UI can show context-sensitive tips drawn from this library. For example, when editing an Investigator’s Brochure document, a side panel might show “**Relevant Guidances:** ICH E6(R2) section x.y recommends including these elements…” or when preparing an IND, it might list the sections as per the CTD format and 21 CFR Part 312.
  - **CTD Mapping:** The Vault has a built-in model of the **Common Technical Document (CTD)** structure (Modules 1-5) ([Common Technical Document (CTD) - ICH](https://www.ich.org/page/ctd#:~:text=The%20CTD%20is%20organised%20into,July%202003%2C%20the%20CTD)). For each regulatory submission project (like preparing an IND or NDA), users can map each uploaded document to a CTD section. The system visually shows a CTD hierarchy with check marks on sections that have documents and warnings on missing ones. It also supports multiple regional adaptations of CTD (eCTD), so Module 1 (region-specific) can be managed differently for FDA vs EMA, for instance. This mapping ensures completeness of dossiers and helps assemble submissions efficiently.
  - **21 CFR Part 11 Validation:** The platform itself is built to be Part 11 compliant, but the content can also be checked for compliance with other parts of 21 CFR. For instance, if an investigator brochure must comply with 21 CFR 312 (IND content requirements), the system could have a checklist and even use AI to validate that certain key statements or data are present in the document. The AI might analyze a clinical trial protocol and verify if all elements required by ICH GCP or FDA regulations (like safety monitoring plan, statistical methods, etc.) are covered, flagging omissions. This acts as a quality control for regulatory documentation.
  - **Regulatory Intelligence & Updates:** The **ICH Wiz™** component monitors changes in global regulatory standards. It tracks multiple agencies (FDA, EMA, PMDA, etc.) and can alert users about new or revised regulations that might affect their projects. These alerts link to the full text of the new guidance and summarize implications. In the portal, a Regulatory Affairs persona can view a feed of recent regulatory changes and, for each, see which current projects or documents might need updating due to the change (thanks to the system’s cross-reference of where certain regulations are cited or applicable).
  - **Expert Guidance & Templates:** When initiating a new document or process, the system can provide templates aligned to regulations. For example, if a Medical Writer starts a new CSR (Clinical Study Report), a pre-populated template structured per ICH E3 guideline is provided. The AI assistant can also fill in boilerplate text or adapt a previous similar document as a starting point, saving time while ensuring compliance. There is also an **interactive Q&A knowledge base** – users can ask, “What is required in section 2.7.3 of CTD?” and get an answer quoting the appropriate guidance.

- **Integration & Extensibility Module:** Recognizing that biotech companies often have existing systems, TrialSage Vault is extensible:
  - **API Access:** The platform exposes secure APIs for key functionalities, allowing external systems to push or pull data. For example, a laboratory information system could push a new stability report document via API into the Vault under the CMC folder, triggering a notification to CMC users. Or a corporate data warehouse could query the Vault for metrics on document cycle times for process improvement analysis.
  - **Plugin Architecture:** The front-end is built to accommodate plugin modules. If future modules are developed (say a **Risk Management tool** or an **eTMF – electronic Trial Master File** integration), they can be added and appear as new sections/tabs in the UI. The AI assistant’s knowledge can also be extended by adding new data sources (for instance, connecting a safety database so the assistant can answer pharmacovigilance questions).
  - **Single Sign-On (SSO) & Integrations:** OAuth2/OIDC support means the portal can integrate with enterprise SSO providers (Azure AD, Okta, etc.), simplifying login for users and aligning with IT security policies. Integration with Microsoft 365 is considered – e.g., users can directly open a document in online Word for editing or save an email from Outlook into the Vault via a plugin. The portal can also sync with calendar apps to populate key dates (like submission due dates or meeting reminders) on user calendars.
  - **Replit Deployment Considerations:** Since the target is deployment on Replit, the design emphasizes using Replit’s secrets management for API keys (OpenAI keys, DB connection strings), and its persistence for any needed state. All services and the DB are containerized so they can run within Replit’s environment. The solution can be deployed as a single Replit workspace (monorepo style), using environment variables for configuration (database URL, etc.). Logging and monitoring can leverage Replit’s console and any add-ons for observability, with the option to integrate external logging services if needed.

In summary, the TrialSage Vault portal’s feature set covers end-to-end needs: from managing multiple studies and their documents, ensuring compliance at every step, leveraging AI for intelligence and automation, to providing actionable insights via dashboards – all wrapped in a secure, user-friendly portal for biotech professionals.

## UX Journey per Persona

Each user persona will experience a customized journey through the portal, tailored to their goals and responsibilities. Below we outline the typical UX journey for each persona, highlighting their dashboard, key interactions, and the value they get from the system:

### CEO / Executive Persona
- **Dashboard & Overview:** Upon login, the CEO lands on an **Executive Dashboard** summarizing the entire portfolio. They see high-level metrics like the number of active projects, each project’s phase and status, upcoming major milestones (e.g., “IND submission for Project Alpha in 30 days”), and risk indicators (perhaps an overall *Compliance Health* score or any critical alerts). For instance, a widget might show “Overall FDA Compliance: 97.8%” indicating most required tasks are done, or highlight that one submission is flagged at risk.
- **Portfolio Drill-down:** From the dashboard, the CEO can click into any project to see more details. If they click on Project Alpha (say a Phase II trial for a new oncology drug), they get a snapshot: timeline of the trial progress, budget vs actual (if integrated), key documents status (e.g., CSR completion at 87%), and team contacts. They might not dive into individual documents often, but they have access to final reports or summary documents. The UI is oriented towards giving them confidence that things are on track or calling attention to problems.
- **AI Assisted Insight:** The CEO might use the AI assistant by asking strategic questions like “What were the major findings from our Phase II trial for Project Alpha?” The assistant provides a succinct summary pulled from the Clinical Study Report, with a link to the full CSR if the CEO wants to read more. If the CEO asks a forward-looking question, e.g., “How likely are we to meet our Q4 submission target?”, the assistant can aggregate data from the timeline intelligence module and reply with an assessment (perhaps “2 out of 10 tasks are behind schedule, indicating a moderate risk to the Q4 target, primarily due to a delay in CMC documentation. Recommend reallocating resources or adjusting timeline.”).
- **Investor Updates:** If the CEO needs to prepare an update for investors or the board, they can easily export a pre-formatted **executive summary report** from the portal. This could include key metrics and charts (auto-generated by the BI module) and a narrative overview drafted by the assistant. The CEO’s journey is streamlined and mostly read-only, focused on oversight and decision support, with minimal data entry. They also have the ability to approve high-level decisions or sign off on critical documents if needed (e.g., final approval on a submission package), which the system will present in a simple review workflow.

### Investor / External Stakeholder Persona
- **Secure Access & Limited View:** Investors (or partner stakeholders) log in via a special **Investor Portal** interface which is essentially a restricted view of the system. They only see the projects or data specifically shared with them (often high-level results and milestones, no granular operational data unless allowed). The UI for an investor is simplified: it may feature a **portfolio status page** and access to read-only documents like top-line reports, publications, or milestone reports.
- **Portfolio Status Page:** This page might show a list of investments (projects) with a brief status: e.g., “Project Alpha – Phase II completed, filing IND Q4 2025; Project Beta – Phase I ongoing, 50% enrolled.” Each entry could be expandable to show more, like key dates, any recent press releases or major findings. Investors can quickly grasp how each venture is progressing.
- **Document Access:** Investors might have access to select documents such as an **Investor Brief** (auto-generated periodic summary), key regulatory filings once public, or summary results. They can click to view these in the built-in viewer (with watermarks to discourage unauthorized sharing). All such access is tracked.
- **Interactive Queries:** An investor could query the AI assistant with something like, “What differentiates Project Alpha’s therapy from competitors?” If allowed, the assistant might draw on the project’s target product profile or public info to answer. Or they might ask, “Has the IND for Project Alpha been filed yet?” and the assistant will confirm status and date. The assistant will not reveal confidential details the investor isn’t permitted to see – if asked something beyond scope, it politely refuses or provides a high-level answer.
- **Ease of Use:** The investor persona is likely less tech-focused and uses the portal occasionally, so the design emphasizes clarity: minimal clutter, big picture visuals, and maybe an onboarding tip or two when they log in (like “Click here for the latest quarterly report”). They can set preferences to receive email notifications for major events (like “IND submitted” or “Clinical trial results available”) so they know when to log in. Overall, their journey is about staying informed and confident in their investment.

### Clinical Operations Persona
- **Operations Dashboard:** A Clinical Operations Manager’s home view is a **Trial Operations Dashboard**. This includes metrics such as enrollment figures (e.g., a live chart of patients enrolled vs target per study), site performance (which sites are meeting enrollment goals), protocol deviations count (with severity breakdown), and upcoming schedule (like patient visits or interim analysis dates, if tracked). It also shows any operational alerts, e.g., “Site X has 3 major protocol deviations – above threshold.”
- **Project Management View:** The Ops user can navigate to a detailed project Gantt chart or calendar that shows all ongoing activities across the trial(s). They can see tasks and milestones like “Site Initiation Visit”, “Database Lock”, “CSR Draft Complete” mapped on a timeline. Delays or dependencies are highlighted (e.g., if the database lock is delayed, how it affects CSR completion). They can update certain fields (like mark a milestone complete) which then reflect in timelines and possibly notify others.
- **Document Interaction:** Clinical Ops interacts with documents such as protocols, amendments, monitoring reports, and trial master file documents. In the Vault, they can quickly find the latest approved protocol or pull up an SOP for site monitoring. If a new amendment is needed, they might initiate it by copying the current protocol to a draft (the system versions it and maybe the assistant helps populate the amendment changes). They then collaborate with Medical Writers and Regulatory on finalizing it through the workflow.
- **Issue Management:** The portal might include a **Quality/Issue tracking** sub-module (or integrate with one). For example, if there’s a protocol deviation or a site issue, Ops logs it (or it’s logged via an integration with an EDC system). The dashboard and AI highlight these: “4 protocol deviations (1 Major, 3 Minor) detected.” The Ops person can click that to see details and decide if a CAPA is required. If yes, they can trigger a CAPA workflow (which could create tasks for CMC or others if it involves drug supply, etc.). This might tie into the Quality Events tracking mentioned in the Vault features.
- **AI Assistance:** The Clinical Ops user can ask the assistant for operational insights, like “Which sites are at risk of missing enrollment targets?” The assistant could analyze enrollment data and respond, e.g., “Site C is at 60% of the monthly target, significantly behind others; primary reason might be slower startup (site activated 1 month later) and smaller catchment area.” If the user asks, “What can we do to improve it?”, the assistant might reference strategies (perhaps from past data or knowledge base) such as increasing site staff or adding a new site – basically acting as a smart advisor.
- **Collaboration:** Ops often needs to coordinate between teams. The portal facilitates this with @mention comments on documents or tasks (e.g., on the monitoring report, they can mention @RegAffairs to review a particular issue). Notifications ensure the right people see it. There’s also integration with email or Teams/Slack for these mentions if configured.
- Overall, the Clinical Operations journey is about keeping the trial running smoothly: they use the portal to monitor progress, identify and mitigate issues, ensure that documents like protocols and reports are up to date, and orchestrate the many moving parts of trial execution.

### Medical Writer Persona
- **Writer’s Workspace:** Medical Writers see a **Document-Centric Dashboard**. It highlights documents currently “In Draft” or awaiting their action. For example, it may list “Draft CSR for Study XYZ – due 2025-04-30”, “Protocol Amendment 2 – in progress, last edited by Dr. Smith”, etc. They might also see a content calendar of upcoming deadlines (submissions or reports due).
- **Authoring Tools & Templates:** When the writer opens a document in the Vault, they get an integrated authoring experience. They can either use the built-in rich text editor (for simpler documents) or open in Word online via integration, while still saving versions back to the Vault. The system offers **templates and guidance**: a side panel could outline the required sections (say for a CSR) and track completeness. The Medical Writer can invoke the **AI assistant** within the document for help – e.g., “Insert a summary of efficacy results in this section” and the assistant will fetch from the stats outputs or earlier interim report and draft a paragraph (which the writer then edits to final voice).
- **Literature Search and References:** For documents like Clinical Evaluation Reports (CER) or investigator brochures, writers need to do literature reviews. The system’s **CER Generator** tools provide an interface to search external literature databases (integrations with PubMed or internal libraries). The assistant can run an **automated literature search** based on criteria and return relevant papers. It can even synthesize evidence or perform gap analysis as hinted by the product’s features (identifying where supporting data might be missing). Writers can import references with one click and have the system manage citations.
- **Collaboration on Documents:** Multiple writers or reviewers might collaborate. The portal shows who is currently viewing/editing a document (presence indicator), and supports comments and suggestions. For review, a writer can send the document into a *Review Round*, which notifies assigned reviewers. Reviewers make comments (the system might allow inline annotations similar to Word’s comments). The writer sees all feedback in one place and can respond or resolve them. The AI assistant can help by clustering similar comments or even proposing resolutions (for example, if two reviewers ask for the same clarification, the assistant might suggest a combined change).
- **Regulatory Compliance Checks:** Before finalizing, the Medical Writer can run an **“AI compliance check”** on the document. The assistant will cross-verify the content against a checklist (like if writing a protocol, did we include endpoints, statistical plan, etc. as per guidelines?). It might output a brief report: “Missing section: No text describing data monitoring committee – required by ICH E6 for trials with high risk. Consider adding.” This helps the writer ensure the document is complete and compliant.
- **Finalization and Handover:** Once the document is ready, the writer transitions it in the system to *Ready for Approval*. They may tag a Regulatory Affairs person for final approval. Because the system manages the flow, the writer doesn’t have to chase via email; they’ll get notified when it’s approved or if further changes are requested. After approval, the writer might use the system to generate different format outputs if needed (PDF, or splitting into CTD pieces).
- In sum, the Medical Writer’s journey is focused on **content creation and refinement**. The portal serves as an intelligent authoring environment that reduces drudgery (through templates, AI suggestions) and catches mistakes, allowing the writer to concentrate on quality of writing and accuracy.

### Regulatory Affairs Persona
- **Regulatory Dashboard:** The RA professional’s dashboard is tuned to **Regulatory Project Management**. It lists all submission projects (INDs, NDAs, amendments, etc.) and their status. A visual timeline might show each submission as a bar with key milestones: drafting, internal review, QC, submission to authority, and authority response. There’s likely a **“Dossier Completion”** indicator for each (e.g., IND Package for Project Alpha is 85% complete with 2 documents pending). The RA user sees tasks like “Review Module 2 summaries for Project Alpha” or “Prepare response to FDA query by Aug 10”.
- **Submission Assembly:** The portal assists in building the actual submission packages. The RA can use a **Submission Wizard** (akin to the IND Building Wizard) that walks through each required section of an application. It pulls in final approved documents from the Vault into the correct eCTD structure. The system might auto-generate certain administrative forms or cover letters using stored metadata. The RA can validate the package within the portal (checking format compliance, file nomenclature, etc.). Time-saving features like **auto-generating certain regulatory documents** (cover sheets, etc.) are included. The result is a ready-to-submit package (which can be exported in eCTD format for uploading to FDA gateways).
- **Compliance Monitoring:** Regulatory Affairs needs to ensure ongoing compliance. In the portal, they have access to the **Regulatory Intelligence** feed (from ICH Wiz and other sources). For instance, they see that ICH E6(R3) guideline was finalized and note that it affects trial oversight practices. The system might highlight which trials might need updated procedures due to the new guideline. They also see a **Compliance Scorecard** (like the FDA compliance rating in the dashboard) which aggregates how well each project meets various compliance criteria. If something is flagged (say, missing training records for a new SOP), they can drill in and initiate corrective action.
- **Review and Approval:** RAs often are approvers for content. They will use the portal to review documents like protocols, CSRs, etc., focusing on regulatory compliance. The portal’s review interface helps them by providing quick links to relevant regulations (for example, while reviewing a protocol, a one-click view of ICH E6 sections for protocols, to cross-check). They can add comments or directly require changes. When all is good, they use the system’s e-signature to approve the document. The system prompts for their credentials and captures the signature record, locking the document as final ([
    eCFR :: 21 CFR Part 11 -- Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures
  ](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-11#:~:text=,indicates%20all%20of%20the%20following)).
- **Interacting with Authorities:** Another aspect is handling correspondence with regulators. The portal can log regulatory communications (e.g., a letter from FDA or an email query from EMA). RA can upload these as records. The timeline for a submission includes these interactions. The assistant can help draft responses to regulator questions by finding relevant info in the Vault. Perhaps a future integration could even interface with regulatory submission portals for direct electronic submission and receiving acknowledgments.
- **Global Regulatory Management:** If the company is global, RA users might manage submissions to multiple agencies. The portal supports multiple **agencies and regions** configurations for each project. RA can switch context between, say, “FDA submission” and “EMA submission” for the same product, seeing separate progress. The knowledge base includes regional differences (like EMA’s Module 1 requirements vs FDA’s). RA’s journey often involves juggling these, and the system aids by keeping everything organized and by providing country-specific checklists.
- All in all, the Regulatory Affairs persona uses the portal as a **mission control for compliance and submissions** – ensuring every piece of documentation is in place, following up on outstanding items, staying ahead of regulatory changes, and ultimately compiling and sending off high-quality submissions with confidence.

### CMC (Chemistry, Manufacturing, Controls) Persona
- **CMC Dashboard:** The CMC manager or team member’s dashboard is focused on **Manufacturing & Quality Documentation**. It might show the status of various CMC documents (validation reports, manufacturing protocols, batch records, stability studies) required for regulatory filings. For example, a chart could track “Stability Studies: 3 ongoing, next report due in 2 weeks” or “Manufacturing Changes: 1 pending regulatory notification”. If the product has multiple formulations or production sites, those might be listed with their own statuses.
- **Document Generation & Automation:** The portal likely includes specialized tools (the **AI-CMC Blueprint Generator** or **CMC Automation Module**) that help create complex CMC documents. The CMC user can input data (like batch analysis results, manufacturing process details) and the system auto-generates draft documents (e.g., Module 3 sections of CTD) in a compliant format. For instance, generating an *Analytical Method Validation Report* or *Stability Protocol* from templates by filling in study-specific data. The AI can also simulate the impact of manufacturing changes globally – if a change is made in a process, it could highlight which regulatory filings in different regions need to be updated, as per the “simulate change consequences across global filings” feature.
- **Quality Events and CAPA:** CMC is closely tied to quality management. The portal’s Quality Events tracking (mentioned as CAPA management) is used by CMC persona to log any deviations in manufacturing or lab results, and manage the CAPA process. For example, if an equipment qualification failed, they log an event, the system assigns an investigation task, tracks completion of the fix, and ensures documentation of the resolution. The dashboard might show “Open CAPAs: 2 (1 overdue)”.
- **Collaboration with Regulatory:** The CMC team produces documents that go into submissions. Through the portal, they work closely with Regulatory Affairs. For example, once a batch record summary is finalized, they mark it ready, and RA gets notified to include it in the submission. If RA needs a change (maybe formatting or additional data), they comment and send it back. This back-and-forth is all tracked.
- **Data Integration:** Possibly, the portal integrates with lab systems or manufacturing execution systems for data. The CMC persona might receive an automated alert that new stability study data is available; they then use the portal to generate an updated stability report. The AI assistant can crunch numbers too: CMC might ask, “Show me trends in assay results over all batches in the last year” – the assistant could fetch data and maybe create a quick graph or summary (identifying any drift).
- **Regulatory Compliance for CMC:** The portal ensures the CMC docs meet ICH and local guidelines. For example, ICH Q-series guidelines (Quality) are part of the knowledge base. When writing a pharmaceutical development report, the system can remind about Q8 (pharma development) expectations. The CMC persona can run a validation to see if all required stability studies for the intended shelf-life are completed and documented. If an **AI-powered manufacturing process optimization** feature is present (as alluded in marketing), the portal might analyze process data to suggest optimizations or flag anomalies that need attention.
- The CMC user’s journey revolves around **documenting and ensuring the quality of the manufacturing process**. The portal reduces their paperwork by automation, provides clear linkages between processes and documents, and connects them with regulatory submission needs so nothing falls through the cracks.

Overall, the UX for all personas is unified in look and feel but **context-sensitive in content**. Each persona has a home base (dashboard) that surfaces what matters most to them and then easy navigation to deeper functionality. The AI assistant acts as a universal guide and helper across all personas, adjusting its role from a data analyst for the CEO to a writing assistant for the Medical Writer to a compliance checker for RA, etc. This ensures that despite the complexity of the system, each user feels it is **tailored to their needs**, improving adoption and satisfaction.

## Key Backend API Requirements

To support the rich functionality, the backend API will provide a comprehensive set of endpoints (or GraphQL resolvers). These are organized by module/domain. Below is an outline of the key API groups and their primary endpoints and capabilities:

- **Authentication & User Management API:** Endpoints for secure authentication, authorization, and user administration.
  - `POST /auth/login` – OAuth2/OIDC login handshake or username/password login (with MFA if enabled). Returns JWT or session token.

  - Possibly: `GET /studies/{studyId}/milestones` or incorporate milestones in study details.
  - `POST /studies/{studyId}/team` – Add a user to a study team with a specific role.
  - `GET /studies/{studyId}/documents` – Quick filter of documents by study.

- **Document Management API:** For all operations on documents and files in the Vault.
  - `GET /documents` – Search or list documents (with query parameters for filtering by project, type, status, etc.).
  - `POST /documents` – Upload a new document or create a document record (returns an ID and an upload URL or uses multipart upload directly). Could also support chunked uploads for large files.
  - `GET /documents/{docId}` – Get metadata and current version info for a document.
  - `PUT /documents/{docId}` – Update metadata or move document to a different folder/tags.
  - `DELETE /documents/{docId}` – Possibly to delete a draft document (if allowed) or flag as deleted/archived.
  - **Versions:** `GET /documents/{docId}/versions` – List version history; `GET /documents/{docId}/versions/{vNum}` – Download or view a specific version.
  - `POST /documents/{docId}/checkout` – Lock a document for editing (if using explicit check-out/in).
  - `POST /documents/{docId}/checkin` – Check-in a new version (with file attached or reference to an upload completed).
  - **Approval Workflow:** `POST /documents/{docId}/submit` – Submit document for review/approval.

  - **Audit:** `GET /documents/{docId}/audittrail` – Retrieve audit log for that document (admin or permitted users).
  - **Search:** `GET /search?query=...` – Search across documents; might integrate with AI so the result could include snippets or follow-up query suggestions.
  - **Tags & Folders:** `GET /tags` – list available tags; `PUT /documents/{docId}/tags` – update tags; `GET /folders/{folderId}/documents` – list documents in a given logical folder.
  - Note: File content retrieval might be direct from storage via pre-signed URLs to offload backend.

- **Workflow & Task API:** Manage workflow tasks (reviews, approvals, training tasks, etc.).
  - `GET /tasks` – List tasks assigned to current user (filter by status: pending, completed).
  - `POST /tasks/{taskId}/complete` – Complete a task (with payload if needed, e.g., approval decision).
  - `POST /tasks/{taskId}/delegate` – Delegate task to someone else (if allowed).
  - `GET /workflows/{workflowId}` – Get status of a workflow (e.g., see all steps and which are done).
  - `POST /workflows` – Possibly to initiate certain ad-hoc workflows (like create a CAPA or training workflow).
  - These APIs ensure the front-end can display and manage the to-do lists for users and trigger backend logic for moving things along.

- **AI Assistant API:** Endpoints facilitating AI queries and content generation.
  - `POST /ai/chat` – Main endpoint to converse with the AI assistant. The payload includes the user query and context info (which module the user is in, maybe an optional list of relevant IDs). The backend will handle calling OpenAI and returning the assistant’s answer, along with any suggested actions or references.
  - `POST /ai/action` – Endpoint for the assistant to request performing an action via a function call mechanism. For example, if using OpenAI function calling, the model might request an action “queryMetrics” or “fetchDocument(docId)” which the backend then executes via this endpoint and returns the result to the model before final answer. (This is more internal, could also be part of `/ai/chat` handling).
  - `POST /ai/summarize` – Convenience endpoint to generate a summary of a given document or set of documents. (The UI might call this when user clicks “Summarize” on a document).
  - `POST /ai/analyze` – Endpoint for analytic questions, which might take a natural language query and return data or a chart. Internally, this might translate NLP to SQL or use the BI engine. The result could be data that front-end visualizes or a textual analysis.
  - All AI endpoints will include the user’s auth context so the backend can enforce that AI only accesses allowed data. They might also stream responses if using a streaming API to allow partial results to show.

- **Analytics & Dashboard API:** Provide data for dashboards and allow queries.
  - `GET /analytics/metrics` – Returns a set of key metrics for the user’s org or project, used to populate dashboard widgets (e.g., enrollment numbers, number of open tasks, etc.). This could be pre-aggregated for performance.
  - `GET /analytics/project/{projId}/metrics` – Specific metrics for a project.
  - `GET /analytics/project/{projId}/timeline` – Data for Gantt chart or timeline visualization (milestones with dates and statuses).
  - `GET /analytics/search?question=...` – Accepts a natural language question and returns a result (similar to AI assistant, but maybe more structured). Alternatively, the front-end might just use the AI endpoint for this.
  - `GET /analytics/reports/{reportId}` – Fetch a pre-defined report’s data or a link if it’s a generated file.
  - Possibly endpoints for creating/updating custom charts if allowing custom dashboards (or that could be done via saving queries on front-end).
  - If using GraphQL, a unified query schema might cover these instead of multiple endpoints.

- **Regulatory & Reference API:** Manage regulatory knowledge base and mappings.
  - `GET /regulations` – List of regulatory references in system (like parts of 21 CFR, ICH guidelines).
  - `GET /regulations/{regId}` – Retrieve text or summary of a specific regulation/guidance.
  - `GET /regulations/updates` – List recent updates or changes (populated by an admin or external feed).
  - `GET /submissions/{subId}/checklist` – For a given submission project, get the checklist of required documents/sections and status (which docs are attached, which are missing). 
  - `POST /submissions/{subId}/assemble` – Generate a submission package (this triggers the IND/NDA assembly process).
  - `GET /submissions/{subId}/dossier` – Download an assembled package or get details (like a zip or directory structure listing).
  - `POST /regulations/validateDoc` – Validate a document against relevant regulations (could also be part of summarize or a different endpoint). E.g., input doc ID, it returns any compliance issues found.
  - These endpoints allow the front-end to present up-to-date regulatory info and ensure nothing is forgotten when preparing submissions.

- **Audit & Logging API:** For retrieving audit logs and system logs for compliance.
  - `GET /audit/trails` – For admins/compliance, retrieve audit trail entries system-wide or filtered (e.g., all actions by user X, or all changes to document Y). This could support pagination or streaming if large.
  - `GET /audit/trails/{entityType}/{entityId}` – Shortcut to get audit trail of a specific entity (project, document, user).
  - `GET /audit/login-history` – See user login history or access logs (for security monitoring).
  - Possibly an `Admin` API group also for configuration settings, etc., but focusing on key.

Each of these API endpoints will enforce authorization checks. We will leverage middleware (like JWT verification and role checking) to ensure only allowed roles can call certain endpoints or perform certain actions ([
    eCFR :: 21 CFR Part 11 -- Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures
  ](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-11#:~:text=,perform%20the%20operation%20at%20hand)). For example, only a user with an “Admin” or “Project Manager” role can call `POST /projects` to create a project; only a RA role can approve a document in the regulatory category, etc. These rules correspond to the role definitions established in the multi-persona support.

The API will be thoroughly documented (OpenAPI/Swagger or GraphQL schema docs) to facilitate integration and future extension. Also, since Replit implementation is intended, we’ll ensure the API can run on the provided environment (likely single-process Node, using libraries that work without native dependencies issues on Replit).

## Database Schema Suggestions

The system’s data model will be implemented in a PostgreSQL database (via Supabase). The schema is designed to support multi-tenancy (i.e., multiple client organizations), versioned documents, and complex relationships like many-to-many (users in projects, documents in tags). Below are the key tables (entities) and their core fields and relationships:

- **organizations** – Each row represents a tenant (a company or client using TrialSage Vault). Fields: `org_id` (PK), `name`, `subscription_plan`, `created_at`, etc. This allows isolating data by organization. Many tables will have an `org_id` foreign key to link records to the owning org, and row-level security will use this.
- **users** – Stores user accounts. Fields: `user_id` (PK), `org_id` (FK to organizations), `email`, `name`, `password_hash` (if not using external auth), `is_active`, etc. Additional profile info like title, department, etc., can be included. One user belongs to one primary organization (though we could allow a user to be invited to multiple orgs with different roles, but often for SaaS each user is primarily in one company; external collab could be modelled as separate user accounts or linking accounts).
- **roles** – A reference table listing possible roles/personas (e.g., CEO, Investor, ClinOps, MedWriter, RegAffairs, CMC, Admin). Fields: `role_id`, `name`, `description`. Pre-populated with those 6 personas and perhaps sub-roles like “Admin” or “Project Manager” etc. Alternatively, roles could be hard-coded and not a table, but having a table allows extension.
- **user_roles** – An association table mapping users to roles (and potentially scope):
  - Fields: `user_id`, `role_id`, `org_id`, `project_id` (nullable). This allows assigning roles either globally at org level or specific to a project. For example, a user could be a Medical Writer on one project and a Clinical Ops on another if needed. Or an Investor role might be tied to just one project they invested in. If role is organization-wide (like CEO), `project_id` is null. Composite primary key (user_id, role_id, project_id).
- **projects** – Represents a project or program under an organization. Fields: `project_id` (PK), `org_id` (FK), `name` (e.g., “Project Alpha – Oncology Drug X”), `description`, `status` (e.g., Active, Completed, On Hold), `start_date`, `end_date (or est_end_date)`, etc. Could also have fields for therapeutic area, indication, etc., depending on needs.
- **studies** – Represents an individual study or clinical trial, possibly linked to a project. Fields: `study_id` (PK), `project_id` (FK, could be null if a study stands alone, but likely each study belongs to a project), `org_id` (for quick access too), `name` (e.g., “Study ABC-123 Phase II”), `phase`, `status` (Planning, Ongoing, Completed, etc.), `indication`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `lead_id` (FK to users for study lead). If the distinction between project and study is not needed, we could simplify to just projects with a type; but likely needed to model multiple studies per project.
- **documents** – Represents a document (logical document with potentially multiple versions). Fields: `doc_id` (PK), `org_id`, `project_id` (FK, nullable if global), `study_id` (FK, nullable), `title` or `name`, `doc_type` (could be an enum or FK to a doc_types table, e.g., Protocol, CSR, SOP, etc.), `status` (Draft, In Review, Approved, Archived), `current_version_id` (FK linking to document_versions table for the latest version), `created_by` (FK to users), `created_at`, `regulatory_category` (could store something like CTD section mapping, e.g., “Module 2.7.3” or a reference to a separate table of sections). Also possibly a `external_ref` if linking to an external system (DocuShare ID etc.). The `documents` table holds metadata that persists across versions, while content and files go to versions.
- **document_versions** – Each row is a specific version of a document. Fields: `version_id` (PK), `doc_id` (FK to documents), `version_number` (1,2,3…), `file_path` or `storage_key` (to retrieve the file from storage), `uploaded_by` (FK user), `uploaded_at`, `change_summary` (text notes about what changed), `is_approved` (boolean, if that version was approved/final), `approval_signature_id` (FK to signatures if an electronic signature was captured for approval of this version), etc. This table allows retrieving old versions and their metadata.
- **document_tags** – Many-to-many linking for tags. Fields: `doc_id`, `tag` (or tag_id if tags are predefined in a table). Could also incorporate module links: e.g., linking a document to a module origin like “CSR Intelligence output”. If more complex taxonomy, we might have separate tables: e.g., **tags** (tag_id, label, maybe type), and a join **document_tag** (doc_id, tag_id).
- **folders** – (Optional) a table for user-defined folders or hierarchy. Might not be needed if we rely on tags and metadata. But if we want a fixed tree structure like shown (CMC Documents -> Validation), we can have a table for folder structure. Fields: `folder_id`, `org_id`, `parent_folder_id`, `name`, `project_id` (if folders can be per project or global). Another approach is to generate the folder tree based on document attributes (like a virtual hierarchy by type).
- **tasks** – Workflow tasks for users. Fields: `task_id` (PK), `org_id`, `workflow_id` (FK to a workflow instance table), `name` or `description` (“Review Document X”, “Complete Training Y”), `due_date`, `assigned_to` (FK user), `status` (Pending, Completed, etc.), `created_at`, `completed_at`, `related_entity_type` & `related_entity_id` (like if it’s linked to a document or other item for context). For training tasks, related_entity might be a document that needs reading.
- **workflows** – Table representing a workflow instance (like a specific document approval process or CAPA process). Fields: `workflow_id`, `type` (e.g., DocumentApproval, CAPA, Training), `status` (Active, Completed, Cancelled), `initiator_user_id`, `initiated_at`, `completed_at`, `context` (maybe JSON storing additional context like doc_id, etc. or foreign keys to link, e.g., `doc_id` if it’s a doc approval workflow).
- **comments** – Comments or annotations on documents (or could be generalized to any entity). Fields: `comment_id`, `doc_id` (or maybe `entity_type` & `entity_id` to reuse for other types), `author_id`, `created_at`, `text`, `reply_to` (for threaded comments), maybe `resolved` flag if using comments for issues that can be closed.
- **audit_logs** – Generic audit log table. Fields: `audit_id` (PK), `org_id`, `user_id` (who performed action, nullable if system), `timestamp`, `entity_type` (e.g., Document, User, Project, etc.), `entity_id`, `action` (string like “CREATE”, “UPDATE”, “DELETE”, “APPROVE”, “LOGIN”, etc.), `details` (JSON blob with specifics like changed fields or description). This table can grow large; partitioning by date or by org might be wise. It’s central for compliance, capturing all critical events. It should be append-only. We might have a separate **e_signatures** table for Part 11 signature records: capturing user, time, meaning of signature, linked to the thing signed (which could also reflect in audit, but having a table makes it easier to show signature manifests).
- **regulatory_refs** – Table of regulatory references and requirements. Could be structured as a hierarchy for CTD sections and regulations:
  - e.g., entries for each CTD section (Module 1, Module 2.7.3, etc.) with description, or each CFR part. Fields: `ref_id`, `category` (CTD, CFR, ICH Guideline, etc.), `name` (like “Module 2.7.3 Clinical Safety”), `description` or `text_ref` (maybe link to full text externally or summary).
  - Might also have **regulatory_checklist** – which ties a submission type to required items (mapping of what docs are needed). This could be a static knowledge base in code or data.
- **submission_projects** – If we explicitly track a submission (which might be a subset of a project or a milestone), this table could represent a regulatory submission instance (like “IND for Project Alpha to FDA”). Fields: `submission_id`, `project_id`, `type` (IND, NDA, CTA, etc.), `agency` (FDA, EMA…), `status` (In Preparation, Submitted, Approved, etc.), `target_date`, `submitted_date`, etc. This helps track each formal submission separately from the overall project.
- **submission_documents** – A join table linking required CTD sections (or submission content items) to actual documents in our system. Fields: `submission_id`, `ref_id` (link to regulatory_refs, e.g., a specific CTD section), `doc_id` (if fulfilled by an existing document), `status` (e.g., Draft, Finalized, Not started). This table essentially drives the UI for the submission assembly wizard, showing which sections have docs attached.
- **analytics_data** – We may not need a separate table if we compute on the fly, but possibly maintain some aggregated metrics or snapshots for performance. Alternatively, could integrate something like Supabase’s Data RLS or just use SQL views. However, if doing predictive analytics, maybe a table for predicted values (like predicted approval date, etc.) updated periodically.
- **AI_index** – If implementing our own vector search in DB, a table to store embeddings of documents or text chunks:
  - Fields: `embedding_id`, `org_id`, `doc_id`, `chunk_index`, `embedding` (vector type using pgvector), `content_excerpt`. This would allow similarity searches via SQL. If using an external vector store, this might not be needed in DB, but Supabase pgvector means we can keep it in Postgres.
- **ai_queries** (optional) – log of AI assistant interactions if we need to store them (for audit or improvement). Fields: `query_id`, `user_id`, `timestamp`, `question`, `answer`, `feedback` (if user rated it, etc.).

All relationships are properly indexed. For example, `documents` will be indexed by `project_id`, `study_id` for quick filtering; `audit_logs` indexed by `entity_id` and timestamp; `user_roles` by user and project for permission checks, etc. Where appropriate, we enforce cascade deletes carefully or use soft deletes (e.g., if a project is deleted, perhaps its documents are archived rather than hard-deleted, due to regulatory retention needs).

We also leverage PostgreSQL features:
- **Row-Level Security (RLS):** All queries append an `org_id = current_user.org_id` condition automatically (Supabase can do this via policies), ensuring one tenant never sees another’s data ([
    eCFR :: 21 CFR Part 11 -- Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures
  ](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-11#:~:text=,perform%20the%20operation%20at%20hand)). Additional RLS policies can restrict access further by role (e.g., only users with role allowing document view can select from documents table, etc. – though often easier to enforce in app logic).
- **JSON fields:** We might use JSONB columns for flexible data in some places (for example, storing the content of a regulatory reference, or extra metadata that varies by document type).
- **Full Text Search:** To aid search, Postgres’s full-text search or the Supabase FT index could be used on documents table (or maybe on an indexed table of text content if small docs). However, since we plan semantic search, we rely more on vector search and the AI. Still, text search can be a quick way to find simple keyword matches.

**Database Example:** Creating a new document would involve inserting into `documents` (with status Draft, version null initially) and then inserting the file info into `document_versions`. Approving a document updates `documents.status` to Approved, sets `current_version_id` to that version, and inserts an audit_log and signature entry. All these in a transaction ensure consistency.

The above schema covers the core entities. Additional tables might be introduced as we refine (for example, a `meetings` table if scheduling, or `external_links` if linking to external data systems). But this provides a strong backbone to implement the required features.

## OpenAI / AI Integration Strategies

The integration of AI (particularly OpenAI’s GPT-4 or similar models) is central to TrialSage Vault’s intelligent assistant and automation features. Our strategy is to harness AI in a controlled, context-rich manner to maximize usefulness while minimizing errors or “hallucinations.” Key strategies and design decisions include:

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** As noted, we implement a RAG pipeline for any queries that require factual answers from our data. This means before the AI formulates an answer, our system performs a **contextual search** across relevant data:
  - We use a combination of **semantic search** (via vector embeddings) and traditional keyword search to fetch snippets from documents, knowledge base entries, and database records that pertain to the user’s query ([Options for Solving Hallucinations in Generative AI | Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/options-for-solving-hallucinations-in-generative-ai/#:~:text=1,chatbot%20with%20factually%20correct%20information)) ([Options for Solving Hallucinations in Generative AI | Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/options-for-solving-hallucinations-in-generative-ai/#:~:text=The%20above%20flow%20shows%20the,the%20exact%20words%20don%E2%80%99t%20match)). These snippets (with sources) are provided to the GPT model as additional context in the prompt.
  - By grounding the AI’s input in real data, we significantly reduce hallucination and ensure answers can be traced back to authoritative sources. For example, if asked about a trial result, the model sees the actual result data paragraph from the CSR in the prompt, so its answer will closely reflect that.
  - We maintain an **embedding index** of all important textual data: regulatory guidelines text, past reports, knowledge articles, etc. This index is updated whenever new documents are added or updated. Vector similarity search finds relevant passages even if the query words don’t exactly match the text (capturing synonyms or related concepts).
  - RAG is a proven approach for enterprise AI to ensure factual accuracy ([Options for Solving Hallucinations in Generative AI | Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/options-for-solving-hallucinations-in-generative-ai/#:~:text=Achieve%20Performance%2C%20Cost%20Efficiency%2C%20and,Scalability%20with%20RAG)), and we will use it as the default for the assistant’s question-answering tasks.

- **Modular Prompt Engineering:** Depending on the function the AI is serving, we craft specialized system prompts and use fine-tuned models if necessary:
  - For the **Chat Assistant** that users converse with, we give it a role prompt like: *“You are TrialSage, an expert assistant in clinical trials and regulatory affairs. You have access to the user’s authorized documents and a knowledge base of regulations. Answer questions helpfully, citing document IDs where appropriate. If unsure or data is not available, say so or suggest an action.”* This ensures the AI’s tone and behavior are appropriate for enterprise (formal, helpful, concise) and that it knows to cite sources.
  - We might maintain separate prompts for different query types. For instance, a prompt template for **data analytic queries** which instructs the AI how to output a summary with possibly some statistics, versus a prompt template for **document drafting** which instructs on format and compliance.
  - If we find the base GPT-4 model is not sufficiently tuned to our domain, we may use **OpenAI’s fine-tuning** on a smaller model or employ few-shot examples in the prompt. Additionally, some open-source LLMs fine-tuned on medical/regulatory text could be hosted for certain tasks to avoid sending sensitive data outside.
  - We also utilize **function calling** feature of OpenAI: we define functions like `get_data(query)` or `submit_workflow(task)` that the AI can invoke. For example, if the user asks “How many documents are waiting for my approval?”, the AI could call a function that queries the DB for count of pending approvals for that user, then answer with that number. This ensures precision for such queries and offloads heavy data retrieval from the model to our deterministic logic.

- **Hallucination Mitigation and Verification:** Despite RAG, we put additional guardrails:
  - The assistant is instructed not to fabricate document references. It only cites something if it’s truly from a retrieved source. We can programmatically check the assistant’s output for any references and verify they exist in our database or knowledge set. If the assistant says “according to the protocol…” we ensure that protocol text was indeed in context. This can be done by scanning the answer for any identifiers and cross-checking, or by using OpenAI’s own content-filter tools.
  - If the model returns an answer with high uncertainty (some LLM APIs provide a logit confidence or we can parse for phrases like “I’m not sure”), we can have it either automatically append a suggestion to consult a human or we can choose to not show an answer and instead show “The assistant could not find a confident answer.”
  - For critical operations (like making a decision or providing advice that has regulatory impact), we can implement a double-confirmation. The assistant might provide an answer and then separately provide a rationale or steps for verification. We can show the user both: the answer and the supporting excerpts, so the user can verify themselves easily.
  - Over time, we plan to measure the assistant’s performance by capturing user feedback thumbs-up/down on answers. This feedback loop (stored in `ai_queries` table) will help fine-tune prompts or identify areas to improve.
  
- **AI for Document Processing:** Not all AI usage is via the chat interface. We also use AI behind the scenes:
  - When a new document is uploaded, an **AI document analyzer** runs (if enabled). It might extract key information: e.g., identify if it’s a protocol, extract the protocol title, phase, primary endpoints, etc., to populate metadata fields automatically. It can also generate a short summary for quick preview. These AI-generated metadata are stored for search and display (with manual review if needed).
  - The AI also flags potential issues (as described in compliance check). Technically, this could be implemented by having a set of QA prompts for different document types. For a protocol, a prompt to GPT might be: “You are an expert checking a clinical trial protocol for completeness. List any elements you think are missing or any glaring issues.” The response is then parsed into a checklist for the user.
  - AI is used in the **Semantic Search** feature by indexing and by possibly re-ranking search results. For example, after initial search results, an LLM can be asked to re-order or group them by relevance to the query intent.
  - Another use: **Translation or Localization** – if needed, the AI could translate text for multinational operations (e.g., translate a document summary to Japanese for PMDA). This could be an on-demand feature integrated via the assistant (“Translate this paragraph to Spanish”).

- **AI Modules Integration:** The platform’s specialized AI modules (IND Wizard, CER Generator, etc.) likely each have their own AI models or prompts. The client portal coordinates with them:
  - For instance, the **IND Wizard** might have an engine to generate draft IND sections. The portal will call that (which might itself call OpenAI with a prompt template for IND content) and then the result is stored as a document.
  - The **CSR Intelligence** module uses AI to answer questions across a large set of study reports. In practice, this might index all those reports and use an LLM to find answers. Our central AI assistant can channel queries into that module if it detects the question is specifically about historical data analysis (“3,217+ parsed clinical study reports” as per marketing). Implementation-wise, we could maintain one big vector index for all such reports and a specialized prompt for summarizing multiple documents if needed.
  - The key is our architecture allows **pluggable AI pipelines**. We might have different prompt configurations or even different models for each feature, but we unify access through the assistant interface or contextual UI actions. For example, a user in CER Generator clicking “Analyze gaps” triggers an AI routine specific to CER that eventually might respond via the assistant UI with results.

- **OpenAI API Usage and Limits:** We will use the OpenAI API with care for rate limits and cost:
  - The back-end may implement caching of frequent AI responses (especially for repeated questions like “what is 21 CFR Part 11?” which many users might ask – we can cache that answer). 
  - For large documents, instead of sending the whole text to the model, we use summarization or chunking strategies (embedding large docs and retrieving only relevant chunks for the prompt). This keeps prompts within token limits.
  - We’ll maintain a fallback plan: if OpenAI API is down or too expensive for some clients, the design can accommodate swapping to a local model. Possibly hosting a smaller LLM on the server for basic Q&A (with likely lower quality), or at least gracefully degrade by performing just keyword search and returning those results.
  - Data privacy: All prompts to OpenAI are stripped of personal data. Where possible, we avoid sending raw confidential document text. Instead we use vector similarity (which doesn’t reveal original text, just numerical embeddings) to find answers, or send only small relevant snippets. We also might use OpenAI’s **enterprise offering** which ensures data is not used for training and is kept private, or consider Azure OpenAI which offers more enterprise control.

- **Continuous Learning and Knowledge Updates:** We plan a mechanism to update the AI’s knowledge as regulations change or new internal learnings are available:
  - The regulatory knowledge graph can be periodically updated by ingesting new guidelines or QC-ing the AI’s outputs for accuracy. We might have an admin interface for a regulatory expert to input the official interpretation or summary of a new rule, which the assistant will then incorporate.
  - The assistant could also be used to draft internal knowledge articles (for example, an RA might formalize an answer the assistant gave into the knowledge base for everyone). Over time, the corpus the AI draws from gets richer and more tailored to the company’s processes.

In essence, our AI integration strategy is about making the assistant a **trusted co-pilot** for the users: always available to help, armed with the company’s and industry’s knowledge, but constrained by guardrails to avoid misguiding users. By combining retrieval techniques ([Options for Solving Hallucinations in Generative AI | Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/options-for-solving-hallucinations-in-generative-ai/#:~:text=1,chatbot%20with%20factually%20correct%20information)), targeted prompt engineering, and oversight, we leverage OpenAI’s power safely in a highly regulated domain.

## Security and Compliance Checklist

Security and regulatory compliance are paramount for an enterprise platform managing sensitive clinical and regulatory documents. Below is a checklist of the key measures and features we implement to meet **industrial-strength security** and compliance requirements:

- **Multi-Tenancy Isolation:** Each organization’s data is logically isolated. Every database query and file storage path is scoped to the organization. We enforce this through database row-level security and organization IDs in JWT claims. No user can ever access another tenant’s data – the API will verify the `org_id` on every request against the authenticated user’s org. This protects intellectual property in a multi-tenant environment as strictly as if each had a separate instance.

- **Strong Authentication (OAuth2/OIDC):** The system uses OAuth2 for auth, supporting integration with enterprise SSO providers (Azure Active Directory, Google Workspace, Okta, etc.). This enables multifactor authentication and policies like password rotation to be handled by the identity provider. For built-in auth, we enforce strong passwords, 2FA, and have measures against brute force (rate limiting login attempts, CAPTCHA if needed). Sessions use short-lived JWTs with refresh tokens to reduce risk. Logout and token revocation are handled properly.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Fine-grained permissions are defined for each role/persona. We have a centralized policy that dictates what each role can do in each module (e.g., Investors can only view specific dashboards and documents marked shareable; Medical Writers can edit draft documents but not approve; Regulatory Affairs can approve and see submission sections; CMC can only see CMC folder documents; etc.). The backend checks these permissions on every relevant endpoint. We also allow role combinations and custom permission tweaks for flexibility, but all are managed through an admin UI with audit logging of changes.

- **Least Privilege Principle:** Users only see and can do what they need. Within a project, if someone doesn’t need access to CMC docs, we can restrict that. Data views in the UI also respect this (e.g., an Ops user’s dashboard won’t show finance info if that’s not in their purview, and an Investor won’t see internal commentary). Administrative functions (user management, system config) are limited to admin roles.

- **Data Encryption:** All data in transit is encrypted via HTTPS/TLS 1.3. Replit deployment will use HTTPS for the domain and websockets secured accordingly. Data at rest in the database and storage is encrypted (Supabase provides encryption at rest on Postgres and Storage). For particularly sensitive fields (like passwords, API keys, or perhaps patient identifiers if any exist), we apply an extra layer of encryption or hashing at the application level. Document files in storage are encrypted and accessible only via secure signed URLs with short expiry when a user downloads/view them.

- **Audit Trails & Monitoring:** In compliance with 21 CFR Part 11, the system generates secure, computer-generated, time-stamped audit trails for all critical operations ([
    eCFR :: 21 CFR Part 11 -- Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures
  ](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-11#:~:text=%28e%29%20Use%20of%20secure%2C%20computer,for%20agency%20review%20and%20copying)). These logs include creation, modification, deletion (if allowed) of electronic records (documents, data entries) and are designed such that they cannot be altered without detection. The audit trail records are retained as long as the records themselves and are available for inspection ([
    eCFR :: 21 CFR Part 11 -- Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures
  ](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-11#:~:text=%28e%29%20Use%20of%20secure%2C%20computer,for%20agency%20review%20and%20copying)). We implement monitoring that alerts on suspicious activities (e.g., a user downloading a large number of documents in short time, or repeated failed login attempts which could indicate an attack). The platform can integrate with SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems, exporting logs for centralized monitoring by the client’s IT security team.

- **Electronic Signatures Compliance:** Where electronic signatures are used (approving documents, etc.), the system complies with FDA requirements. Each signature record captures the name of signer, date/time, and meaning of the signature (approval, review, etc.) ([
    eCFR :: 21 CFR Part 11 -- Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures
  ](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-11#:~:text=,indicates%20all%20of%20the%20following)). The signature is linked to the record such that it cannot be separated or altered ([
    eCFR :: 21 CFR Part 11 -- Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures
  ](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-11#:~:text=)). Users must re-authenticate (enter password or use 2FA) at the time of signing to verify identity. We maintain signature manifests that can be presented in human-readable form alongside the record, fulfilling §11.50 requirements ([
    eCFR :: 21 CFR Part 11 -- Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures
  ](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-11#:~:text=)). The system prevents signature reuse or delegation in ways not allowed (each electronic signature is unique to one individual) ([
    eCFR :: 21 CFR Part 11 -- Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures
  ](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-11#:~:text=Subpart%20C%E2%80%94Electronic%20Signatures)). We’ll also provide functionality to lock signed records from further editing.

- **System Validation and Documentation:** As an enterprise system for regulated use, TrialSage Vault will come with validation documentation (IQ/OQ/PQ – Installation/Operational/Performance Qualification) to satisfy audits. The development follows a **SDLC with validation** in mind: requirements traceability, documented testing (unit, integration, user acceptance tests), and change control procedures. We maintain system documentation (specifications, architecture, test evidence) under version control. This addresses regulatory expectations that the software itself is validated for its intended use.

- **Backups and Disaster Recovery:** Automated backups of the database and file storage are performed regularly (e.g., nightly full backups, and point-in-time WAL archiving for the database). These backups are encrypted and stored securely (possibly in a different region). We have a disaster recovery plan such that if Replit’s instance fails or data corruption occurs, we can restore with minimal data loss (target RPO of a few minutes) and minimal downtime (target RTO of a couple hours at most). The system can also export data in standard formats (e.g., all documents and metadata in a structured form) so clients can archive their data or migrate if needed, ensuring data portability.

- **Network Security & Isolation:** The backend will be configured to accept requests only from the front-end domain or authorized sources (CORS and auth tokens enforce that). Internally on Replit or any cloud, we use network policies so that the database is not openly accessible – ideally only the application server can talk to the DB (or using Supabase’s built-in API with secure keys). We keep all secrets (DB passwords, API keys) out of code (using environment secrets). Regular penetration testing and vulnerability scanning will be conducted. We keep dependencies updated to patch security issues (and use a monitoring service for new CVEs in our stack).

- **OWASP Top 10 and Secure Coding:** The application is built to be resistant to common web vulnerabilities: 
  - SQL Injection is prevented by using parameterized queries / ORM.
  - XSS is mitigated by React’s escaping and security review of any dynamic HTML usage.
  - CSRF is handled by using same-site cookies or anti-CSRF tokens for state-changing requests (though with JWT auth, maybe using Authorization header avoids cookies altogether).
  - We implement content security policy (CSP) headers to mitigate XSS and data injection from third-party content.
  - File uploads are scanned and type-checked to prevent uploading of malicious code (and served with appropriate headers so they are not executable).
  - Rate limiting and validation on APIs protect against brute force or abuse.
  - Server-side input validation ensures no invalid data goes through (each API will validate request payloads against expected schema, preventing misuse).
  - The code will undergo peer reviews focusing on security aspects. 

- **Privacy Compliance (HIPAA/GDPR):** While primarily dealing with trial and regulatory docs (not direct patient health records), there could be personal data (investigator names, patient data in reports). We comply with data privacy laws:
  - For **GDPR**, ensure we have capabilities to delete or anonymize personal data if a data subject requests. Store only necessary personal data and allow organizations to configure retention for personal data. We’ll sign Data Processing Agreements as needed, and host data in approved regions.
  - If any health data is included, for **HIPAA** we would implement required safeguards (the measures above on encryption, access logs cover many, plus policies for employees handling data). We would designate the system as HIPAA compliant and not use PHI in AI prompts that go external unless we have a BAA with the provider (OpenAI now offers BAAs for certain services).
  - The system does not directly collect patient identifiers typically, but if say patient profiles were included, we’d label that data and secure it accordingly. 

- **Blockchain Audit Option:** As mentioned, for clients desiring extra assurance, we have an optional feature that logs hash fingerprints of documents or audit records onto a blockchain or distributed ledger. For example, each time a document version is finalized, we compute its SHA-256 hash, and write a transaction to a public or private blockchain (or even Ethereum/Bitcoin via an anchoring service) containing that hash. Later, any stakeholder or auditor can independently verify the document hasn’t been altered by comparing its hash. This provides an immutable audit trail externally verifiable ([Document Management with Blockchain | A Comprehensive Guide | by Oodles Blockchain | Medium](https://medium.com/@marketing.blockchain/document-management-with-blockchain-a-comprehensive-guide-56732af6ae7b#:~:text=Legal%20and%20Regulatory%20Compliance)). This is optional due to cost and complexity, but demonstrates our forward-looking approach to data integrity.

- **Performance and Scalability Safety:** (While not exactly security, it’s reliability) We ensure the system remains robust under load. High usage or large file uploads won’t crash it. We use job queues for long tasks to keep the system responsive. We also guard against denial-of-service: e.g., heavy query endpoints are paginated, expensive operations require appropriate permissions to avoid abuse. Our infrastructure can scale up if one tenant suddenly uses a lot of resources (e.g., a large document OCR) without affecting others by isolating processes if needed.

- **Compliance Certifications:** We design the platform to be ready for **SOC 2 Type II** audits and ISO 27001 certification. This means implementing not just technical, but administrative controls: access logs for who in our team accesses customer data, least privilege for developers, regular security training, incident response plans, etc. While the user asked for design, mentioning this shows we align with industry standards for SaaS. For GxP (good practice) compliance, we maintain proper change management (every production deployment is documented, tested, and approved). Also, if the platform will manage electronic records for FDA submissions, clients might need to show vendor qualification – our documentation and process will support that.

- **User Activity Logging:** Beyond audit logs, we give admins oversight tools. They can see active user sessions, force logouts if suspicious, and review usage stats. In case of an account compromise, having this visibility allows quick action (like disabling a user or investigating what was accessed).

- **Failsafe and Recovery:** In any case of partial system failure, the system fails secure. For example, if the AI service is malfunctioning, it simply won’t provide an answer rather than give a wrong one. If the permissions service fails, by default deny access. We avoid single points of failure where possible and use health checks to detect issues.

Each item on this checklist will be regularly reviewed as part of quality management. Given our user base (top-tier biotech and regulatory professionals), we expect audits, so we build everything with an **audit-ready mindset**: all configurations and records can be exported or shown in a human-friendly report to demonstrate compliance (who has what access, proof that audit trails are active, etc.). By taking this exhaustive approach to security and compliance, we ensure that TrialSage Vault is not only a powerful platform but a trustworthy one that stands up to regulatory scrutiny and protects the valuable data entrusted to it.
