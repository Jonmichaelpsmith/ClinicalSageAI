Issue 1: Collaboration API routes never registered
The server defines collaborationRoutes but never attaches them to the Express app. The routes file only imports the module; no app.use call exists.

Source example:

13:import collaborationRoutes from './routes/collaborationRoutes';
111:declare module './routes/collaborationRoutes' {

Without registration, the collaboration features (messages, tasks, milestones, AI suggestions) are unreachable.

Suggested task

Issue 2: Missing security integration for collaboration components
The repo provides a SecurityProvider with CSRF protection, session timeout and audit logging utilities, but it lives in tmp_backup and is unused. Collaboration components operate without these protections.

Example security provider excerpt:

15   * Security Provider Component
16   * Adds enterprise-grade security features to the application:
17   * - Content Security Policy (CSP)
18   * - Session management and timeout
19   * - CSRF protection
20   * - Security audit logging

Suggested task
Apply SecurityProvider to collaboration hub

Issue 3: No conversation audit logging
Messages exchanged in ProjectCollaborationHub and chat.js are only kept in memory or returned to clients. There is no persistent log for auditing.

Snippet showing memory-only storage:

16  router.post('/chat/message', async (req, res, next) => {
...
41  const conversationHistory = [
42    { role: 'system', content: systemInstruction },
...

Suggested task
Add persistent conversation audit logs

Issue 4: Incomplete security settings for collaboration records
ClientSecuritySettings.jsx contains audit options but nothing specifically addresses collaboration data retention or blockchain backup for chat logs.

Excerpt:

95:      auditSettings: {
96:        retentionDays: data?.auditSettings?.retentionDays || 365,
97:        enableBlockchainBackup: data?.auditSettings?.enableBlockchainBackup || true,

Suggested task
Add collaboration audit configuration

Issue 5: Limited collaboration features
Current UI supports basic messaging, tasks, and milestones. There is no threaded messaging, reactions, or file sharing akin to Slack/Teams.

Excerpt from the collaboration README lists only messaging, tasks, milestones, approvals, and AI suggestions:

7  - Real-time team communication in project context
8  - AI-powered smart suggestions and task recommendations
9  - Milestone tracking with manager approval workflows
10 - Task management with priority-based organization

Suggested task
Enhance collaboration UI and features
View task
These changes will make the collaboration solution closer to robust platforms like Slack or Teams, with configurable security and complete auditability.
