TrialSage Study Architect™
“The world’s first AI-driven, end-to-end protocol & study design studio—natively integrated into your CMC, IND, CSR, CER, RegIntel, and Vault modules.”

🎯 Vision
Enable any study team—novice or expert—to craft, simulate, validate, and launch a fully compliant clinical study protocol in hours, not weeks, with AI guidance at every step, seamless hand-offs to IND submissions, data collection, CSR analytics, and beyond.

🌟 Key AI-Powered Features

Feature	What It Does	Market Differentiator
Protocol Blueprint Generator	From simple study descriptors (phase, population, objectives), GPT-4 crafts a first-draft protocol outline: study rationale, objectives, endpoints, design schema, schedule of assessments, CRF maps.	Auto-drafts 70% of protocol text; no manual boilerplate.
Adaptive Design Simulator	Runs Monte Carlo & Bayesian simulations on your proposed design (parallel, crossover, adaptive arms), visualizes power curves, predicted enrollment timelines, and drop-out impact.	Integrated, real-time simulation instead of offline SAS.
Intelligent Endpoint Advisor	Recommends primary & secondary endpoints based on therapeutic area, historical trial data, CDISC/SDTM mappings, and LOINC/MEDDRA term usage.	AI-curated library of validated endpoints across 5,000+ trials.
CRF & SDTM Variable Mapper	Suggests CRF fields, eCRF pages, and auto-maps them into SDTM/ADaM datasets with controlled terminology (LOINC, MedDRA), then validates via RegIntel Validator.	One-click CDISC-compliant CRF → data-package pipeline.
Risk-Based Monitoring Planner	Identifies high-risk data fields and sites based on past deviations patterns (CSR Intelligence), then auto-generates a monitoring plan with frequency, triggers, and CAPA templates.	AI-backed RBM plan generation aligned to ICH E6(R3).
Global Compliance Checker	Instantly flags protocol sections that need regional customization (EU amendments, PMDA requirements, MENA specifics), and proposes localized language.	“File once, submit everywhere” with live jurisdictional guidance.
Integrated Change Tracker	Every edit to the protocol triggers an AI-powered impact analysis: which IND, CMC, CER, or CSR sections need updates, what validation runs must be re-executed.	True “single source of truth” cross-module change management.
AI Co-Pilot Q&A	Ask anything—“What’s the dropout risk for our diabetic cohort?”, “Show me the protocol’s inclusion/exclusion criteria”, “Suggest alternative dose escalation schemes.”	Context-aware GPT-4 assistant embedded in the protocol editor.
One-Click Submission Export	Auto-package the protocol into an eCTD Module 1/2 dossier, complete with Define.xml, Validation Report, and submission readiness scorecard.	Full lifecycle from design to submission in one workflow.
🔗 Seamless Integration
IMMEDIATE LINK → IND Wizard
Push your draft protocol (Module 2.3) directly into the IND Builder; pull in existing Module 3.2 methods from CMC Insights.

CRF DATA PIPE → Vault & RegIntel
CRF fields auto-saved into Vault Workspace, versioned; upon “lock,” trigger RegIntel Validator to certify dataset readiness.

MONITORING & QMS
Generated RBM plan spawns tasks and CAPAs in your QMS module, with reminders and audit logs.

CSR FEEDBACK LOOP
As CSRs are authored, CSR Intelligence highlights protocol deviations vs. planned endpoints, feeding back into your next protocol draft.
