what’s currently in the Strategic Intelligence tab is not living up to the potential of your platform or the expectations of serious biotech, CRO, and VC users.

Let’s fix this with a next-generation design that does what no other tool can:

✳️ Turn your users’ protocol summaries into strategic, comparative, and predictive clinical intelligence — tied to real-world trial outcomes.

🔁 Strategic Intelligence Redesign (Next-Level Clinical Value)
💡 THE NEW VISION: “What would a regulatory strategist, a biostatistician, and a CMO tell me about this trial — instantly?”
✅ What TrialSage Strategic Intelligence Must Deliver

1. 📊 Design vs. CSR Benchmark
Metric	Your Trial	CSR Median	Position
Sample Size	150	260	⚠️ Low
Dropout Rate	18%	22%	✅
Duration	52 weeks	26 weeks	🟡 Long
Endpoint	PFS	PFS	✅ Match
2. 📈 ML Prediction
Trial success probability: 74.3%

Confidence band (with what variables drive it)

“Design has 82% similarity to successful trials in CSR database”

3. 📎 Strategic Edge
“Your endpoint has been accepted in 12 Phase 3 EMA submissions, but your sample size may limit power in subgroup analysis.”

“Your design duration exceeds typical length for your target population. Consider earlier time-to-data.”
