2. Detailed Component Breakdown

⸻

User Interface Layer (React/Tailwind)
   •   Dynamic Form Panels
(Sponsor Info, Investigator Info, Clinical Protocol Synopsis, IB Upload, etc.)
   •   Real-Time Guidance Sidebar
(AI suggests edits, missing items, risk alerts)
   •   Knowledge Panel
(Ask regulatory questions — RAG retrieval)
   •   File Upload Interface
(Drag-drop CMC files, protocols, IBs, Investigator CVs)
   •   Submission Status Tracker
(Progress bars: “Documents Ready,” “Validation Passed,” “Package Built”)
   •   ESG Submission Wizard (Phase 2)
(Final gateway interface for direct FDA submission)

⸻

Application/Backend Layer (Node.js or FastAPI)
   •   Form Submission APIs
(Capture user inputs, document uploads)
   •   AI Router Service
(Directs requests to GPT models, Embeddings DB, File Search API)
   •   Submission Manager
(Tracks draft states, versions, sequencing)
   •   Document Classification Service
(AI auto-labels and sorts into CTD sections)
   •   Metadata Extractor Service
(Extracts key fields from uploaded documents)
   •   Validation Engine
(Runs pre-submission checks against rules engine)
   •   Packaging Engine
(Assembles full eCTD folder structure, builds XMLs, ZIPs it)

⸻

AI Orchestration Layer (OpenAI APIs + Local Engines)

Service	Tech	Purpose
Form Reasoning Agents	GPT-4 Turbo Assistants	Assist user during form fill, detect missing items
Document Analysis Agents	GPT-4o Vision + Fine-tuned LLMs	Read uploaded documents, extract metadata
Dynamic Knowledge Panel	Embeddings + File Search	RAG answers to regulatory questions
Function Caller	OpenAI Function Calling	Trigger backend validation, packaging, submission routines
Risk Analysis Agent	Fine-tuned GPT-4 Model	Predict Clinical Hold, RTF risks dynamically



⸻

Data Storage Layer

Storage Type	Tool	Data
Vector Database	Pinecone or Weaviate	Indexed CFRs, FDA guidance docs, ICH guidelines
Relational Database	PostgreSQL	User accounts, form data, submission history, sequence metadata
Blob Storage	AWS S3 or Replit Storage	User-uploaded docs (PDFs, DOCX, images, etc.)
Queueing/Background Jobs	Redis, Celery	For heavy tasks like building ZIP packages



⸻

Validation and Packaging Layer
   •   XMLBuilderEngine
(Dynamically generates index.xml, envelope.xml, stf.xml if needed)
   •   FolderStructureBuilder
(M1, M2, M3 standard folder structures built)
   •   eCTD Validator
(Schema checks: file names, document types, required sections)
   •   Risk Predictor
(Flag missing modules likely to trigger RTFs or Clinical Holds)
   •   ZIP Packager
(Final folder structure zipped for download)

⸻

Regulatory Knowledge Core (Living Regulatory Brain)
   •   CFR / ICH Document Library
(Versioned, embedded, auto-updated weekly from public sources)
   •   Case Law Corpus (future)
(FDA Complete Response Letters, RTF letters parsed and indexed for learning)
   •   Learning Engine (future)
(Fine-tunes internal LLMs over time from real user submissions and feedback)

4. Key Design Principles You Are Enforcing
   •   AI-native first — forms, validation, document analysis, submission packing all AI-driven, not dumb workflows.
   •   No Hardcoding — modular architecture ready to adapt to regulatory changes.
   •   Self-Improving System — every submission improves the platform.
   •   Global-Ready — scalable for EMA, PMDA, TGA regional filing formats.
   •   ESG-ready — Phase 2 enables real-time ESG transmission.
   •   Audit-Ready — Full traceability for inspections, audits, 21 CFR Part 11 compliance.
