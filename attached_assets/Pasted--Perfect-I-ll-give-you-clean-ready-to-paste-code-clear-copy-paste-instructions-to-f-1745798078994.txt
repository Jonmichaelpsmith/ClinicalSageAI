  <div class="module-card">
    <h2>IND Wizard</h2>
    <p>Streamline your IND submission process with AI-powered guidance.</p>
    <a href="/ind-wizard">
      <button class="learn-more-btn">Learn More</button>

# 📋 Quick Styling Reminder:

If you want your buttons to look professional,  
you can add a simple style in your CSS:

```css
.learn-more-btn {
  background-color: #007bff;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 18px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.learn-more-btn:hover {
  background-color: #0056b3;
}
```

✅ This will make your "Learn More" buttons **look sharp and clickable** like real SaaS products.

---

# 🎯 Final Result After Fix:

✅ Homepage shows beautiful clean modules  
✅ Clicking "Learn More" goes directly into the working TrialSage software (IND Wizard, CER Generator, CMC Wizard, CSR Analyzer)
