Perfect. Here’s a breakdown of what we’ll need to deliver a fully production-level biostatistical module for TrialSage. This goes well beyond a prototype—think Cytel-like power, but AI-native and CSR-informed.

TrialSage Biostatistics Engine — Full Production Blueprint

1. Core Functional Modules

A. Study Design Architect
   •   Parallel-arm RCT, crossover, adaptive, dose-escalation
   •   Configurable arms, endpoints, alpha/beta, power thresholds
   •   CSR-informed suggestions for design elements (e.g., optimal control group size)

B. Power & Sample Size Calculator
   •   Frequentist: Z-tests, t-tests, ANOVA, survival (log-rank), non-inferiority margins
   •   Bayesian: Posterior probability-based power, credible intervals
   •   Group sequential (O’Brien-Fleming, Pocock) and adaptive simulations

C. Interim Analysis & Stopping Rule Designer
   •   Define number of interims, information fractions
   •   Graphical interface to simulate stopping for efficacy/futility
   •   Boundaries & error spending functions

D. CSR-Informed Historical Comparator Engine
   •   Extract arm-level data (means, SDs, effect sizes) from matched prior studies
   •   Allow Bayesian priors from CSR data to inform assumptions
   •   Visual comparison: forest plots, risk curves, dropout profiles

2. Supporting Systems

A. SAP Generator
   •   Auto-generate Statistical Analysis Plans based on design specs
   •   Aligns with ICH E9, CDISC ADaM/SDTM output specs
   •   Includes mock shells, dummy tables, analysis populations

B. Risk Intelligence Dashboard
   •   Pull AE/SAE patterns, dropout rates, deviation frequencies from CSR library
   •   Quantify and visualize trial execution risk by design choice

C. Regulatory-Grade Audit Trail
   •   Save design iterations, assumptions, version logs
   •   PDF + XML export for submission readiness (aligns with EMA, FDA format)

⸻

3. AI + LLM Layers (Already Partly Built or Readily Integrable)
   •   NLP-pipeline to extract:
      •   Primary/secondary endpoints
      •   Population characteristics
      •   Statistical assumptions (alpha, beta, n)
   •   Prompt-based trial simulation: “Design a non-inferiority trial in T2D with dropout rate under 12% using CSR priors”
   •   Auto-matching engine: Suggest prior trials with similar protocols and outcomes

⸻

4. UI/UX Delivery
   •   Web app inside Replit or standalone React/Next.js frontend
   •   Flow:
	1.	Select indication → pull CSR matches
	2.	Review historical design & outcome data
	3.	Customize design → run power/sim
	4.	Auto-generate SAP → export

⸻

5. Stack Recommendations
   •   Statistical Engine: R + Plumber for backend APIs or Python with statsmodels, scipy, simpy, PyMC
   •   LLM Intelligence: GPT-4 Turbo (structured prompt chaining), with finetuned model to CSR structure
   •   DB: PostgreSQL with vector embeddings for trial matching
   •   Frontend: React + Tailwind or full integration inside Replit Agent UI

Would you like me to now start coding:
	1.	The statistical engine core (power/sample size + design types)?
	2.	The CSR comparator engine?
	3.	The SAP generator from design inputs?

I’ll build this in a form you can plug directly into Replit. Just confirm your preferred order and I’ll begin.
