Here’s a much more detailed, polished, and investor-grade **technical and user-facing summary** of the **TrialSage CER Generator**, integrating everything from the codebase, screenshots, FAERS engine, and the UI/UX flow you’ve designed.

## 🧠 **TrialSage CER Generator**

**AI-Powered Clinical Evaluation Automation for EU MDR & FDA Submissions**

---

### 🚀 Overview

The TrialSage CER Generator is a next-generation regulatory automation module designed to eliminate bottlenecks in medical device and combination product submissions. Built for compliance with **EU MDR 2017/745**, FDA post-market expectations, and ISO 14155 guidance, it fuses real-world adverse event data with literature review automation, GPT-4o reasoning, and structured risk modeling.

This module is not a template engine—it is a true clinical intelligence system that **analyzes, compares, and generates** highly defensible CERs in minutes, not months.

### 🔄 Full Generation Pipeline

#### **Step 1: Intelligent Input Capture**

* Users start from a clear **“Generate Full CER”** action button
* Data input wizard collects:

  * Device name, class (EU/US), regulatory type
  * Manufacturer identity
  * Clinical data references (manual entry or upload)
  * Supporting PDFs, risk assessments, design files
* Live field validation, placeholder hints, and classification logic ensure structured inputs

#### **Step 2: Real-World Safety Signal Ingestion (FAERS Engine)**

* Queries OpenFDA for brand name → maps to:

  * UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifier)
  * Substance name
  * ATC class / pharmacologic group (via `pharm_class_epc`)
* Automatically pulls adverse event reports from FDA FAERS:

  * Seriousness flag
  * Reaction (MedDRA term)
  * Patient age, sex, and date
  * Outcome (death, hospitalization, etc.)
* Risk scores are **weighted and normalized**:

  * 🟥 Death = 3.0
  * 🟧 Hospitalization = 2.0
  * 🟨 Disability = 1.5
  * 🟩 All others = 1.0

#### **Step 3: Comparator Product Analysis**

* Dynamically determines **pharmacologic peers** using ATC or MoA
* Pulls FAERS data for each comparator
* Computes and benchmarks their risk profiles against your product
* Outputs:

  ```json
  {
    "comparator": "Simvastatin",
    "riskScore": 1.87,
    "reportCount": 60
  }
  ```

#### **Step 4: AI Document Generation (GPT-4o)**

* Deep semantic modeling generates 14–18 compliant sections, including:

  * Executive Summary
  * Intended Purpose & Clinical Background
  * Clinical Data Appraisal
  * Safety Profile (with FAERS insights)
  * Risk-Benefit Analysis
  * Literature Evaluation
* Pulls live citations and references (from PubMed, Google Scholar, preprint servers)

#### **Step 5: Compliance QA & Output Compilation**

* AI Confidence and Quality Assurance metrics applied
* Regulatory alignment scored in real time
* Compiled into exportable **PDF and Word** formats
* Automatically versioned and uploaded to **Document Vault** with full audit history

### 📁 Document Management Integration

* CERs are automatically categorized, versioned, and saved to the **Document Vault**
* Metadata includes:

  * Author
  * Timestamp
  * Regulatory type
  * Submission status
* Each CER can be previewed, exported, shared, or submitted via secure portal

---

### 🧭 UX Challenges + Immediate Fix Plan

#### **Current Gaps**

* CER generation entry point not immediately discoverable
* Input fields lack guidance or structured flow
* PDFs not previewable in demo state
* Literature module disconnected from main CER output

#### **Next Prioritized Fixes**

1. Add dedicated **“Create New CER Report”** button in top navigation
2. Build a **step-by-step creation wizard** with visual progress indicator
3. Add **auto-preview panel** for generated CERs before download
4. Refactor “Input Data” tab to be structured and field-guided
5. Enable drag/drop upload of clinical, preclinical, and risk files
6. Add **Risk Heatmap** visualization and **Comparator Score Cards** in AI Dashboard

### ✅ What Makes TrialSage Different

| Feature                     | TrialSage CER Module                 | Traditional CER Tools      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Real-time FAERS integration | ✅ Yes (via OpenFDA + risk scoring)   | ❌ Manual PDF parsing       |
| Comparator analysis engine  | ✅ ATC-class based scoring            | ❌ Not available            |
| Literature auto-citation    | ✅ Structured & AI-verified           | ❌ Manual or semi-automated |
| End-to-end report build     | ✅ PDF, Word, Preview & Vault         | ❌ Requires MS Word authors |
| Regulatory alignment        | ✅ EU MDR, FDA, ISO 14155 scored live | ❌ Offline manual review    |
