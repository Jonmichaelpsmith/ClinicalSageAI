Below is the next step: ensuring your project is correctly configured and deployed on Replit. We'll cover:

1. **Environment Configuration:**  
   Set your OpenAI API key securely within Replit.

2. **Running the Server:**  
   Configure your Replit run command to start the FastAPI server.

3. **Linking the Frontend:**  
   Integrate the React component into your existing frontend so users can access the CER feature.

## 1. Environment Configuration

### A. Set OpenAI API Key
In Replit, open the Secrets (Environment Variables) panel and add:
- **Key:** `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- **Value:** *Your actual OpenAI API key*

Then, update your `cer_narrative.py` to read the API key from your environment instead of hardcoding it. For example:

```python
# cer_narrative.py
import os
import openai

# Ensure the API key is set in your Replit secrets
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

def generate_cer_narrative(faers_data):
    prompt = f"""
    Generate a regulatory-compliant Clinical Evaluation Report narrative using this FDA FAERS data:
    {faers_data}

    Include sections on adverse events, clinical significance, benefit-risk analysis, and comparative effectiveness.
    """
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4-turbo",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        temperature=0.2
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

## 2. Running the FastAPI Server on Replit

### A. Update Your Replit Run Command

Make sure your `.replit` file (or equivalent configuration) uses a command to run the FastAPI server. A common setup is using Uvicorn. For example, add/edit your `.replit` file with:

```ini
run = "uvicorn main:app --host=0.0.0.0 --port=3000 --reload"
```

This command starts your FastAPI app on the default Replit port (commonly 3000) and enables live reload.

---

## 3. Linking the Frontend React Component

### A. Integrate `CERGenerator.jsx`

In your React project folder, ensure that `CERGenerator.jsx` is imported and rendered in your application. For example, in your main App component:

```jsx
// App.jsx
import React from 'react';
import CERGenerator from './CERGenerator';  // Adjust the import path if necessary

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>LumenTrialGuide.AI</h1>
      {/* Other existing components */}
      <CERGenerator />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### B. Configure Proxy (if needed)

If your React development server is separate from your FastAPI backend, you may need to set up a proxy to handle API calls:
- In your React project's `package.json`, add the following line:
  ```json
  "proxy": "http://localhost:3000",
  ```
  This directs API calls (like `/api/cer/{ndc_code}`) to your FastAPI server running on port 3000.

---

## 4. Testing and Validation

- **Local Testing:**  
  Run the FastAPI server with the provided Replit run command and ensure your React frontend is correctly displayed.  
- **Test an NDC Code:**  
  Enter a known valid NDC code in the CER Generator component and click the button to generate the report.  
- **Debugging:**  
  Check the Replit console for any errors, and validate that the FastAPI logs show the expected API call processing.

---

With these changes:
- Your OpenAI API key is securely set via Replit Secrets.
- FastAPI is correctly deployed with Uvicorn.
- Your React UI integrates and communicates with the backend endpoint.
