  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>Patients have a type of blood cell cancer, other blood disease or a genetic disease for&#xd;
which they will receive a stem cell transplant. The donor of the stem cells will be&#xd;
either a brother or sister or another relative or a closely matched unrelated donor. We&#xd;
are asking patients to participate in this study which tests if blood cells from the&#xd;
donor that have been grown in a special way, can prevent the patients from getting an&#xd;
infection with a virus called Cytomegalovirus or CMV.&#xd;
&#xd;
CMV is a virus that can cause serious infections in patients with suppressed immune&#xd;
systems. It usually affects the lungs and can cause a very serious pneumonia, but it can&#xd;
also affect the intestinal tract, the liver and the eyes. Approximately 2/3 of normal&#xd;
people harbor this virus in their body. In healthy people CMV rarely causes any problems&#xd;
because the immune system can keep it under control. If the patient and/or their donor is&#xd;
positive for CMV, they are at risk of developing CMV disease while the patients immune&#xd;
system is weak post transplant. Usually, this risk is highest during the first 3-4 months&#xd;
after the transplant.&#xd;
&#xd;
CMV disease can be prevented during this time in most people by using drugs that can kill&#xd;
the virus such as Ganciclovir, Foscarnet, or Cidofovir . However, these medications have&#xd;
many side effects and have to be given daily by vein for approximately 4-5 months after&#xd;
transplant. One of the side effects is that it takes the new immune system much longer to&#xd;
develop an effective defense against the virus. Therefore, once the medicines are&#xd;
stopped, the patients still have a chance to develop CMV disease.&#xd;
&#xd;
We want to see if we can use a kind of white blood cell called T cells that we have grown&#xd;
from the stem cell donor instead of the regular treatment with Ganciclovir or Foscarnet&#xd;
to prevent CMV from "flaring up". These cells have been trained to attack CMV virus&#xd;
infected cells. We will grow these T cells from blood taken from the donor before the&#xd;
patients transplant. These cells are called CMV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes or CMV&#xd;
CTL, and they will be given to the patient around 30 days after their transplant.&#xd;
&#xd;
We have used this sort of therapy to treat a different virus which can cause problems&#xd;
after transplant called Epstein Barr Virus (EBV). Doctors at other places have used&#xd;
similar T cells to treat or prevent CMV infections after transplant and have not seen any&#xd;
significant problems. These CMV specific cytotoxic T cells are an investigational product&#xd;
not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.</textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>If the patient and their donor are eligible, we will take 100-120 ml (20-24 teaspoonfuls)&#xd;
of blood from the donor 3-4 weeks before the transplant. We will only take as much blood&#xd;
as is safe for the patient and their donor.&#xd;
&#xd;
We will use this blood to grow T cells. We will first infect the peripheral blood&#xd;
mononuclear cells with a specially produced human virus adenovirus) that carries part of&#xd;
the CMV gene to the monocytes which will stimulate the T cells. This stimulation will&#xd;
train the T cells to kill cells with the pp65 from the CMV virus on their surface. If&#xd;
this approach is insufficient to stimulate T cells which will kill the pp65 from the CMV&#xd;
virus then we will grow a special type of cell called dendritic cells which will&#xd;
stimulate the T cells and we will put the specially produced human virus (adenovirus)&#xd;
that carries the parts of the CMV gene (called pp65) into the dendritic cells. These&#xd;
dendritic cells will then be treated with radiation so they cannot grow. They will then&#xd;
be used to stimulate T cells. This stimulation will train the T cells to kill cells with&#xd;
the pp65 from the CMV virus on their surface.&#xd;
&#xd;
We will then grow these CMV specific CTLs by more stimulation with EBV infected cells&#xd;
(which we will make from the blood of the donor by infecting them with EBV in the&#xd;
laboratory). We will also put the adenovirus that carries the CMV pp65 gene into these&#xd;
EBV infected cells so that they too have CMVpp65. These EBV infected cells will be&#xd;
treated with radiation so they cannot grow. Once we have made sufficient numbers of T&#xd;
cells we will test them to make sure they kill cells with CMVpp65 on their surface. To&#xd;
make sure that these cells won't attack the patients tissues, we test these cells against&#xd;
the lymphoblasts that we grow in the laboratory. These will be used to check if the CMV&#xd;
CTL can attack them. Alternatively, we could take a small piece of skin from the patient&#xd;
to grow skin cells which can also be used to check if CMV CTL can attack them. The skin&#xd;
biopsy can be done at the same time of another procedure such as a bone marrow.&#xd;
&#xd;
The donor's CMV CTL cells will be thawed and injected into the patients intravenous line&#xd;
for a period of 10 minutes after the patient received Benadryl and Tylenol. The patient&#xd;
will receive the dose of CMV CTL cells on or after day 30 following their transplant if&#xd;
they agree and are well enough. We will not give antiviral medications during this study&#xd;
but we will monitor the CMV levels weekly for at least 30 days after the transplant. If&#xd;
after the initial dose of CMV CTL cells the patient develops a viral infection, then they&#xd;
may be eligible to receive one additional injection of CTLs at the same dose as the first&#xd;
injection. If the CMV levels in the blood continue to rise after the dose of T cells then&#xd;
the patient will receive treatment with Ganciclovir, Foscarnet, or Cidofuvir.&#xd;
&#xd;
The patient will continue to be followed in the BMT clinic after the injection. They will&#xd;
be seen in the clinic, in the hospital or contacted by the research nurse and have blood&#xd;
tests (to monitor the blood counts, the kidney and liver function and to monitor for&#xd;
viruses) weekly for the first 60 days after the CTL infusion, then at 3, 6, 9 and 12&#xd;
months. To learn more about the way the T cells are working in the body, an extra 20-40&#xd;
mls (4-8 teaspoons) of blood will be taken before the infusion and then 24 hours after&#xd;
the infusion (optional depending on the patients preference), and then at 1, 2, 4 and 6&#xd;
weeks after the infusion. After this, blood will be taken every 3 months for 1 year. The&#xd;
amount of blood taken in the first 12 months will be 260-460mls (1-2 cups). Total time&#xd;
participation for this study will be 1 year.</textblock>
