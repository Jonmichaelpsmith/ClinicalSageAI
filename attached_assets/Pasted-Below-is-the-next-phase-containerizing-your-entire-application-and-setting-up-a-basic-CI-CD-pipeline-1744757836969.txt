Below is the next phase—containerizing your entire application and setting up a basic CI/CD pipeline plan. These steps will help you deploy your solution consistently across environments and automate testing and releases.

---

## 1. Containerization with Docker

By containerizing your FastAPI app, Celery worker, and Redis (which is provided via its official image), you can simplify deployment and ensure consistency between development and production.

### A. Create a Dockerfile for Your FastAPI App

Create a file named **Dockerfile** at the root of your project:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file first to leverage Docker cache
COPY requirements.txt .

# Upgrade pip and install dependencies
RUN pip install --upgrade pip && \
    pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the working directory contents into the container
COPY . .

# Expose port 80 for the FastAPI app
EXPOSE 80

# The command to run the FastAPI application using uvicorn
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "80"]
```

### B. Create a Docker Compose File

Create a file named **docker-compose.yml**. This file defines three services:
- **web:** Your FastAPI application.
- **worker:** Celery worker process.
- **redis:** Official Redis image.

```yaml
version: '3.9'

services:
  web:
    build: .
    container_name: cer_app_web
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    environment:
      - REDIS_HOST=redis
      - REDIS_PORT=6379
      - REDIS_DB=0
      - OPENAI_API_KEY=${OPENAI_API_KEY}  # pass your key via environment variable
      - SMTP_SERVER=${SMTP_SERVER}
      - SMTP_PORT=${SMTP_PORT}
      - SMTP_USERNAME=${SMTP_USERNAME}
      - SMTP_PASSWORD=${SMTP_PASSWORD}
      - JWT_SECRET_KEY=${JWT_SECRET_KEY}
    depends_on:
      - redis

  worker:
    build: .
    container_name: cer_app_worker
    command: celery -A celery_config.celery_app worker --loglevel=info
    environment:
      - REDIS_HOST=redis
      - REDIS_PORT=6379
      - REDIS_DB=0
      - OPENAI_API_KEY=${OPENAI_API_KEY}
      - JWT_SECRET_KEY=${JWT_SECRET_KEY}
    depends_on:
      - redis

  redis:
    image: redis:6-alpine
    container_name: cer_app_redis
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
```

> **Notes:**
>
> - Ensure you define all your secret environment variables (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `SMTP_SERVER`, etc.) either in a `.env` file (and load it using Docker Compose) or by configuring them directly in your Replit secrets.
> - For production, consider using more secure practices for secret management.

## 2. CI/CD Pipeline Outline

A basic CI/CD pipeline can be set up to run your tests, build your Docker image(s), and deploy your containers. Here’s an outline using GitHub Actions:

### A. Example GitHub Actions Workflow

Create a file named **.github/workflows/deploy.yml** in your repository:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-test-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: "3.9"

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run Tests
        run: |
          # Replace the following command with your actual test command
          pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings -q

      - name: Build Docker Image
        run: docker build -t cer_app:latest .

      - name: Push to Registry (optional)
        # Uncomment and configure if you are using a container registry
        # run: |
        #   docker tag cer_app:latest your-registry/cer_app:latest
        #   echo ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }} | docker login your-registry --username ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }} --password-stdin
        #   docker push your-registry/cer_app:latest

      - name: Deploy to Production
        # This step is highly environment-dependent. You might trigger a deployment script here.
        run: echo "Deploy step here. You can SSH to your server or trigger your Kubernetes deployment."
```

> **Notes:**
>
> - This basic pipeline runs tests and builds your Docker image.
> - For deployment, adapt the workflow to suit your environment (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECS, Kubernetes, etc.).
> - Secure your secrets (like Docker registry credentials) via GitHub Secrets.

## Final Remarks

These steps complete the next set of enhancements:
- **Robust Task Management with Celery/Redis:** Your long-running tasks are now offloaded to Celery tasks, with Redis handling the messaging.
- **Persistent Caching with Redis:** Your FAERS data is cached persistently in Redis.
- **Containerization and CI/CD:** Your application is now fully containerized with a Dockerfile and Docker Compose setup, and a basic CI/CD pipeline is outlined.

You should now be in an excellent position to perform end-to-end integration testing and begin preparing for a production rollout.
