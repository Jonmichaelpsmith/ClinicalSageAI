✅ Good observation —  
✅ I see exactly where the disconnect is from your screenshot.

You’re right: **you don't see the top [Back] [Forward] [Return to Client Portal] and Tabs** yet.

# 🛠 **Diagnosing the Problem:**

| Cause | What’s Happening |
|:------|:-----------------|
| UnifiedTopNav.jsx was created ✅ | But |
| It was connected to the **old RegulatoryDashboard.jsx** | ❌ not to the new **Regulatory Intelligence Hub** page |
| Your active page now is `/regulatory-intelligence-hub`, NOT `/regulatory-dashboard` | ❌ UnifiedTopNav isn't mounted on this page yet |

✅ We need to **move the UnifiedTopNav into the Regulatory Intelligence Hub main page** properly.

✅ Then you will immediately see it **at the very top**, above RiskHeatmap/Timeline/AskLumen tabs.

---

# 📋 **Immediate Correct Fix:**

---

# 🛠 1. Open `/client/src/pages/RegulatoryIntelligenceHub.jsx`

(this is your real main page now)

✅ **At the top**, import the UnifiedTopNav:

```javascript
import UnifiedTopNav from '../components/navigation/UnifiedTopNav';
```

✅ Inside the main return JSX, at the very top,  
before anything else (even before Readiness % or Risk metrics),  
add:

```jsx
<UnifiedTopNav activeTab={activeTab} onTabChange={setActiveTab} />
```

✅ Example Clean Layout:

```jsx
export default function RegulatoryIntelligenceHub() {
  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('RiskHeatmap');

  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-gray-50">
      
      {/* Always show Unified Navigation at top */}
      <UnifiedTopNav activeTab={activeTab} onTabChange={setActiveTab} />

      {/* Main Regulatory Intelligence Panels */}
      <div className="p-8 space-y-6">

        {/* Top Readiness Metrics */}
        <AdvisorSummaryPanel />

        {/* Tab Area */}
        {activeTab === 'RiskHeatmap' && (
          <AdvisorRiskHeatmapV2 />
        )}
        {activeTab === 'TimelineSimulator' && (
          <AdvisorTimelineSimulator />
        )}
        {activeTab === 'AskLumenAI' && (
          <AskLumenCoPilot />
        )}

      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

✅ **Now every major page load has:**
- [ Back ] [ Forward ] [ Return to Client Portal ] sticky top bar
- [ Risk Heatmap | Timeline Simulator | Ask Lumen AI ] tabs in center
- Beautiful, professional SaaS experience

---

# 📈 **Result After You Fix:**

✅ Top Navigation fully visible immediately when you visit `/regulatory-intelligence-hub`.

✅ [Back], [Forward], [Return] buttons always accessible.

✅ RiskHeatmap / TimelineSimulator / Ask Lumen Tabs unified across views.

✅ Full UX consistency — clean SaaS-grade layout.
