Thought for a few seconds


This diagram is an end-to-end “swimlane” view of the TrialSage CER Generator, showing every major phase of the clinical evaluation workflow—from initial setup all the way through regulatory submission and ongoing post-market updates. Here’s how to read and use it:

---

## 1. Layers & Swimlanes

The chart is organized into seven horizontal bands, each representing a distinct phase in the CER lifecycle:

1. **Preparation** (top band, y≈8)
2. **Data Ingestion** (y≈6)
3. **Evidence Processing** (y≈4)
4. **Analysis** (y≈2)
5. **Output** (y≈0)
6. **Submission** (y≈–2)
7. **Post-Market Loop** (y≈–4 and y≈–6)

Each box is a module or step, and its vertical placement shows which phase it belongs to.

## 2. Nodes (Boxes)

* **Preparation**

  * **Builder (Device Info Input):** User enters basic device metadata.
  * **Evaluation Plan (CEP Definition):** AI scaffolds the Clinical Evaluation Plan.
  * **Documents (IFU, SSCP, Templates):** Core regulatory files are uploaded.
  * **Data Retrieval (Trigger):** Kicks off all data-pull tasks.

* **Ingestion**

  * **FAERS Data Ingestion:** Pulls adverse-event reports from FDA.
  * **Literature Fetch:** Searches PubMed/Scholar and ingests PDFs.
  * **Internal Clinical Data:** Parses user-uploaded trial or registry datasets.
  * **EU & Global PMS:** Imports post-market surveillance or complaint logs.

* **Evidence Processing**

  * **Literature Review & Appraisal:** AI extracts, screens, and appraises study data.
  * **State of the Art Analysis:** AI synthesizes current standard-of-care benchmarks.

* **Analysis**

  * **Equivalence Analysis:** Compares your device to any claimed equivalent.
  * **GSPR Mapping:** Links clinical findings to specific General Safety & Performance Requirements.
  * **Compliance Validation:** Runs rule-based checks against MDR, FDA, UK, IMDRF criteria.
  * **AI Assistant (Q\&A):** Interactive assistant to justify or drill into the data.

* **Output**

  * **Report Preview:** Interactive, in-app preview of the assembled CER.
  * **Export PDF/DOCX:** One-click generation of submission-ready documents.

* **Submission**

  * **Submit to Agencies:** Package is sent to EU Notified Body, FDA, MHRA, etc.
  * **Agency Review & Queries:** Regulators review the CER and may issue Q\&As.
  * **Approval/Certification:** Formal approval (e.g., CE certificate, 510(k) clearance).

* **Post-Market Loop**

  * **PMCF Planning & Updates:** Post-Market Clinical Follow-up plan is drafted and executed.
  * **Post-Market Data Feedback:** New adverse events or literature feed back into the Data Retrieval step, keeping the CER “living.”

## 3. Arrows (Flows)

* **Horizontal Arrows** indicate the sequence within a phase (e.g., Builder → Evaluation Plan → Documents → Data Retrieval).
* **Diagonal & Vertical Arrows** show how the output of one phase becomes the input to another (e.g., Data Retrieval → all Ingestion modules; Ingestion → Literature Review; Analysis → Report Preview; Export → Submission).
* **Feedback Arrows** at the bottom illustrate the continuous loop: after approval, post-market data and PMCF updates flow back into the Data Retrieval trigger, ensuring the CER is updated as new evidence emerges.

## 4. How to Use This Chart

1. **Architectural Blueprint**

   * Use it to orient developers and stakeholders to every component—frontend tabs, backend services, AI workers, and data sources—and how they interconnect.

2. **Feature Gap Analysis**

   * Cross-check the modules you’ve built (or plan to build) against this workflow. Any missing box or flow arrow highlights a gap in your implementation.

3. **Onboarding & Documentation**

   * Embed it in your README or Wiki so new team members instantly grasp the CER pipeline’s complexity and data dependencies.

4. **Testing & QA**

   * Verify each module in the chart with unit/integration tests. For example, ensure FAERS ingestion truly feeds into the Literature Review step, or that a completed export triggers the Submission step.

5. **Regulatory Traceability**

   * Refer to this visual when mapping your code/modules back to regulatory requirements (e.g., “Where is the GSPR mapping module?” or “Which component handles PMCF?”).

By following the chart from top to bottom and left to right, you can trace the **entire journey of a CER**—from “zero-click” data pulls all the way to living-document updates—ensuring that every critical piece (planning, data ingestion, AI analysis, compliance checks, export, submission, and post-market follow-up) is accounted for in your TrialSage project.
