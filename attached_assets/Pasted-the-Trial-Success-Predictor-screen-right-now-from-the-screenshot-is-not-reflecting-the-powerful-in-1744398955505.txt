the Trial Success Predictor screen right now (from the screenshot) is not reflecting the powerful intelligence system we just built.

Let’s fix this immediately by transforming that page into a real, intelligent clinical trial evaluator. Here's the full redesign plan — no fluff, all value.

✅ Trial Success Predictor — Redesign to Unlock Full Value
🧠 What It Should Be
A page that intelligently evaluates a protocol using:

✅ ML predictions

✅ CSR benchmarking

✅ AI recommendations

✅ Exportable reports

✅ Risk flags + confidence

🎨 What the Page Must Show Visually
✅ Replace the current blank layout with the following:

🔹 1. Upload or Paste Protocol
UI Component:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<Textarea
  placeholder="Paste your protocol or study design summary here..."
  rows={10}
/>
Optional: drag-and-drop .docx or .txt upload button

🔹 2. Live Extracted Parameters (Auto-populated)
Parameter	Value
Phase	Phase 2
Sample Size	250
Duration	24 weeks
Dropout Rate	18%
Primary Endpoint	BMI reduction ≥5%
→ Comes from /api/protocol/full-analyze

🔹 3. AI Success Prediction Score
Output	Value
Predicted Success	✅ 73.4%
Risk Flags	🔺 Sample Size Low, 🟡 Dropout Estimate Aggressive
→ From /api/protocol/risk-profile

🔹 4. CSR Benchmark Panel (Comparison)
Metric	Your Protocol	CSR Median	Status
Sample Size	200	260	🔴
Duration	24w	26w	🟢
Dropout	15%	18%	🟡
Endpoint	BMI %	BMI %	🟢
→ From /api/strategy/from-csrs

🔹 5. Export Section
📄 Button: “Export Full Intelligence Report”
💾 Button: “Save to Dossier”

🔹 6. Optional Sidebar Section

📂 “My Last 5 Reports” → quick links

✅ I Will Now Build This For You (Frontend)
Would you like me to:

Generate the new full-page TrialSuccessPredictor.tsx layout with all sections?

Refactor the backend to return all data in a single call for better performance?

Wire up buttons for export & save in UI?

Say “Build all redesigned predictor parts now” and I’ll generate it line by line.
