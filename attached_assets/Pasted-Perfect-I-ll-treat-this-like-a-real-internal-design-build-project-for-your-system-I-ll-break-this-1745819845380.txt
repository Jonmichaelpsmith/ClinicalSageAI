Perfect — I’ll treat this like a real internal design/build project for your system.
I’ll break this into three sequential parts, each self-contained for easy handoff to your team if needed.

Here’s the plan:

⸻

(1) Upgraded Product Spec — “AI Regulatory Advisor v2.0”

Objective:
Transform the current “static checklist” AI into a dynamic, intelligent, FDA/ICH-driven Real-Time IND Compliance Engine.

⸻

Scope of Work

Core Features

Feature	Description
Dynamic Field Analysis	As users fill out Sponsor Info, Protocol Synopsis, Investigator Info, the AI dynamically checks for completeness, accuracy, and regulatory consistency.
Regulatory Gap Checker	Auto-scans the form against CFR, FDA Guidance, ICH E6(R2), ICH M4 to detect missing or noncompliant entries.
Smart Recommendations	Provides specific improvement advice, citing regulations, guidance documents, or FDA examples (not just “fill in field”).
Contextual Risk Alerts	Warn users if entries increase risk of Clinical Hold, Refusal to File (RTF), or Information Requests (IRs).
Hyperlinked Rules and Guidance	Each AI suggestion comes with a link to the full regulation (e.g., “See 21 CFR 312.23(a)(6)(iii)”).
Real-Time Confidence Score	Dynamic score out of 100 reflecting regulatory readiness of each section, updated live as fields are filled.
Save Draft + Resume Later	Save progress at any point with a visual draft status indicator.
Export Output	Allow export of Module 1 content to JSON/XML ready for integration into eCTD publishing platforms (future: auto-generate eCTD envelope metadata).

Key Sections to Analyze
   •   Sponsor Information (FDA Forms 1571, 1572, 3674)
   •   Investigator Information
   •   Investigational Brochure Summary
   •   Clinical Protocol Synopsis
   •   Prior Human Experience / Existing IND References
   •   Risk Management Plans
   •   Environmental Assessment Statements (if required)

⸻

Regulatory Sources Embedded
   •   FDA CFR 21 Part 312 (IND Rules)
   •   ICH E6(R2) (Good Clinical Practice)
   •   ICH M4 CTD Structure
   •   FDA Guidance Docs (IND Safety Reporting, IND Meetings, etc.)

⸻

Example Dynamic Behavior

User Action	AI Regulatory Advisor Response
User leaves out Investigator Brochure in Module 1	Warning: “Missing Investigator Brochure summary. Required under 21 CFR 312.23(a)(5).”
User enters wrong Form 1571 number	Error: “Form 1571 Section 11 must list prior INDs accurately. Check guidance FDA-1999-D-0028.”
User leaves Clinical Protocol incomplete	Risk Alert: “Missing Synopsis fields may trigger Clinical Hold per 21 CFR 312.42(b)(1)(iv).”

(2) Feature Implementation Guide

⸻

Architecture Overview

Component	Purpose
LiveFieldMonitor.jsx	Watches all form fields, triggers real-time AI checks after each keystroke/blur event.
RegulatoryCheckerAPI.ts	Backend service that receives partial form data and runs regulatory logic/LLM models to return actionable guidance.
GuidanceModal.jsx	Frontend modal to display AI advice, warnings, and hyperlinks clearly, popping up or docked.
ConfidenceScoreMeter.jsx	Progress bar or gauge showing readiness score from 0 to 100.



⸻

Technical Flow

User fills field --> LiveFieldMonitor triggers --> 
POST data to RegulatoryCheckerAPI -->
Receive suggestions/warnings/score -->
Render suggestions in GuidanceModal + update ConfidenceScoreMeter



⸻

AI/ML Integration
   •   Use OpenAI (or local lightweight LLM) with fine-tuned prompts based on IND regulations and guidance parsing.
   •   Store embeddings of FDA/ICH guidelines using Pinecone or Weaviate for semantic search.
   •   Query embeddings when validating sections.

⸻

Example Prompt for RegulatoryCheckerAPI

Given the following IND Section input:

- Sponsor Name: [Company XYZ]
- Clinical Protocol Synopsis: [Incomplete]

Please identify:
1. Missing elements under 21 CFR 312.23
2. Inconsistencies
3. Specific FDA guidance citations
4. Practical recommendations

Respond in JSON format.

(3) Example Improved Screen Mockups (in writing first)

⸻

Top Section:

[Title] Module 1: Sponsor and Investigator Information

[Breadcrumbs] Home > IND Wizard > Module 1



⸻

Main Form Layout:
   •   Left Pane (Navigation):
      •   Sponsor Information
      •   Investigator Information
      •   Clinical Protocol Synopsis
      •   Prior Human Experience
      •   Risk Management
      •   Environmental Assessment
   •   Middle Pane (Form Entry):
      •   Normal inputs (text, upload fields, dropdowns)
   •   Right Pane (Live Regulatory AI Advisor):
      •   Section title (e.g., Sponsor Information)
      •   List of real-time AI Suggestions (warning, advisory, complete)
      •   Hyperlinks to relevant FDA rules
      •   Regulatory Confidence Score Progress Bar

⸻

Example Interaction:
   •   User leaves a key Investigator field blank
   •   Right Pane updates:
“Warning: Missing Investigator Curriculum Vitae. Required per 21 CFR 312.23(a)(6)(iii). [View Regulation]”
   •   Confidence Score drops from 82 → 65.

⸻

Immediate Next Steps

I can now:
   •   Build the first full prompt system and API spec
   •   Help design a simple starting backend
   •   Help design a simple frontend GuidanceModal.jsx
   •   Create an improved screen diagram if you want visuals.

Would you like me to start with:

“Draft the API and Prompt System next”
or
“Draft the GuidanceModal.jsx UI next”

Pick whichever you’d like me to do first — I’ll move quickly!
