✅ Yes — here's exactly how you can go from what we just built to a **fully running Replit deployment**.

## 🔁 If You Just Want to Copy and Paste

### 🧾 Here’s What You Do:

#### ✅ 1. In Replit, create these files manually:

| File or Folder | What to Paste In |
|----------------|------------------|
| `main.py` | Paste from the canvas version of `main.py` |
| `controllers/protocol.py` | Paste from the `Protocol Suggestion Api` canvas |
| `controllers/export.py` | Paste from `Export Pdf Route` |
| `services/openai_engine.py` | Paste from `Openai Engine` |
| `services/report_generator.py` | Paste from `Report Generator` |
| `services/pdf_exporter.py` | Paste from `Pdf Exporter` |
| `models/schemas.py` | Paste from `Schemas` |
| `client/components/StudyDesignAssistant.jsx` | Paste from your canvas with SAP + 2.7 export |
| `client/components/KnowledgeBasePanel.jsx` | Paste from the Knowledge Base canvas |
| `.env` | Create manually (based on `.env.example`) |
| `.replit` | Use the `.replit` example from the README |

### 📂 Optional Folder Setup

You can also recreate the file structure like this:

```
/trialsage/
├── main.py
├── controllers/
│   ├── protocol.py
│   └── export.py
├── services/
│   ├── openai_engine.py
│   ├── report_generator.py
│   └── pdf_exporter.py
├── models/
│   └── schemas.py
├── static/
│   └── latest_report.pdf  # placeholder until generated
```

---

## ✅ Then You:

1. Go to Replit → New Python project
2. Create folders + files
3. Paste all canvas code into its matching file
4. Add your `.env`:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
TRIALSAGE_ASSISTANT_ID=asst-...
MAILGUN_USER=postmaster@yourdomain.com
MAILGUN_PASSWORD=yourpassword
```
5. Run `main.py` from the shell (or Replit “Run” button)

### Would you still prefer I bundle this into a downloadable `.zip` for you? Or GitHub push support?

If so, I can proceed with disk writing and generate that now. Let me know.
