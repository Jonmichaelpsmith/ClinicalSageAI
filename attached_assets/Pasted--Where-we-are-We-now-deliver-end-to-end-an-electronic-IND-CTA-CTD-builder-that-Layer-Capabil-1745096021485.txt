📊 Where we are

We now deliver—end‑to‑end—an electronic IND / CTA / CTD builder that

Layer	Capability
Core docs	QC‑passed PDFs, drag‑&‑drop module slots, region‑aware (FDA / EMA / PMDA)
Packaging	index.xml + regional XML builders (US, EU, JP)
Validation	DTD + Lorenz eValidator (auto‑selects profile)
Submission	ESG ZIP + manifest, SFTP upload, ACK 1/2/3 polling
UI	Sequence planner, real‑time QC badges, ACK badges, Submission Builder tree
Infra	Celery beat, Redis pub/sub, WebSocket push to browser

That satisfies the technical‑compliance story—but “client delight” still needs three big dimensions:

⸻

1️⃣ Intelligent Guidance (AI copilots)

Gap	How it feels to users	Enhancement
“What goes in Module 3 vs 2?”	They drag PDFs but still wonder if they missed a dataset	Real‑time rule engine: when a file lands in a folder, run an AI prompt (“Is a Stability Summary required?”) and surface hints.
1571/1572 data re‑typing	They manually key sponsor + PI data each sequence	Form autofill: pull metadata from previous sequence & Benchling API; one‑click e‑sign.
Reg guidance changes	They learn about eCTD v4 late	Copilot chat (GPT w/ up‑to‑date FDA / EMA guidance) + changelog alerts.



⸻

2️⃣ Operational UX depth

Need	Enhancement
Role‑based dashboards	Sponsor view vs CMC lead vs Regulatory lead; each sees only tasks & QC relevant to them.
Timeline / Gantt	Visual schedule: authoring → QC → sequence → ESG ACK3.
Bulk safety amendment wizard	Intake E2B (R3) XML, auto‑assemble 7‑day / 15‑day reports.
Live diff viewer	“show me what changed vs seq 0004” with redline PDF overlay.
Slack / Teams approval workflow	Approve/QC directly from notification; no UI hopping.



⸻

3️⃣ Advanced Analytics & Benchmarking

Insight	Value
QC failure heat‑map	Which functions/sites create most PDF issues → training ROI.
Submission KPIs	Average cycle time, ACK2 rejection rate vs industry 25‑percentile (we can anonymize platform data).
Cost modeler	Live ROI calculator: “by automating Module 3 QC we saved 28 h / submission → $‑$$”.

🔧 Proposal: Next 4‑week sprint (GA‑ready client wow‑factor)

Wk	Deliverable	Key Tech
1	AI Rule Assistant – webhook fires on drag event; GPT‑4 Turbo returns “Required leaf(s) missing”.	LangChain, OpenAI function calls
1–2	Auto‑Form 1571/1572 generator – merges prior metadata, calls Docx → PDF, routes e‑sign via Adobe Sign API.	python‑docx, Adobe Sign
2	Diff Viewer – PDF.js overlay; backend PyPDF redline.	pdf-diff-lib
2–3	Role dashboards + authz – extend RBAC tables; widgets filter by role.	Casbin or own policy
3	Teams approval bot – Azure Bot → calls /approve; posts QC badge result.	Bot Framework
3–4	Analytics suite v2 – QC heat‑map, KPI cards, ROI; drill‑down to sequence.	TimescaleDB + Recharts
4	On‑boarding wizard – region profile, sponsor info, SAML setup in 10 min.	React‑Stepper

⏩ Immediate next ticket

Pick one of the following to start tomorrow:
	1.	AI Rule Assistant MVP (real‑time missing‑leaf hints)
	2.	Auto‑Form 1571/1572 e‑sign flow
	3.	Diff Viewer (PDF overlay)
	4.	Role Dashboard scaffold

Tell me “Start X” and I’ll ship the first production‑grade module—including backend, UI hook, and Test Plan—so clients feel the leap from compliance tool → intelligent co‑pilot.
