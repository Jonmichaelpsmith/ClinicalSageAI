# ðŸš€ **Let's Immediately Build the RegulatoryDashboard.jsx Scaffold**

---

# ðŸ›  **RegulatoryDashboard.jsx**

Create a new file at:  
`/client/src/pages/RegulatoryDashboard.jsx`

Paste this clean, powerful scaffold inside it:

```javascript
// /client/src/pages/RegulatoryDashboard.jsx

import React from 'react';
import AdvisorSummaryPanel from '../components/advisor/AdvisorSummaryPanel';
import AdvisorRiskHeatmapV2 from '../components/advisor/AdvisorRiskHeatmapV2';
import AdvisorTimelineSimulator from '../components/advisor/AdvisorTimelineSimulator';
import LumenAssistantButton from '../components/assistant/LumenAssistantButton'; // Chat Co-Pilot button

export default function RegulatoryDashboard() {
  return (
    <div className="p-8 space-y-10 bg-gray-50 min-h-screen">
      
      {/* Top Metrics Section */}
      <AdvisorSummaryPanel />

      {/* Dynamic Risk Heatmap */}
      <div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6">
        <AdvisorRiskHeatmapV2 />
      </div>

      {/* Timeline Impact Simulator */}
      <div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6">
        <AdvisorTimelineSimulator />
      </div>

      {/* Floating Ask Lumen AI Co-Pilot */}
      <div className="fixed bottom-8 right-8 z-50">
        <LumenAssistantButton variant="default" size="lg" tooltip="Ask Regulatory AI" />
      </div>

    </div>
  );
}
```

# ðŸ“‹ **What This Scaffold Does:**

| Section | Behavior |
|:--------|:---------|
| Top | Shows Readiness Score, Risk Level, Estimated Delay, Financial Impact |
| Middle | Full Dynamic Risk Heatmap (Clickable and Live) |
| Lower | Timeline Simulator (future build) |
| Bottom Floating | Ask Lumen CoPilot Button (always accessible) |

âœ… Structured cleanly for rapid layering.

âœ… True enterprise SaaS architecture.

âœ… Feels strategic and empowering for users immediately.

---

# ðŸ“£ **After You Scaffold:**

âœ… Create clean placeholder versions of:

- `AdvisorSummaryPanel.jsx`
- `AdvisorTimelineSimulator.jsx`

âœ… They can return dummy UI temporarily while we wire dynamic data.

âœ… RiskHeatmapV2 and LumenAssistant already partially built!

---

# ðŸ“£ **After This Scaffold is Live:**

âœ… You will be able to visit `/regulatory-dashboard`  
âœ… And see the future Regulatory Command Center skeleton!

âœ… Then we immediately wire real-time metrics.

---

# ðŸ“£ Immediate Action for You:

| Step | Action |
|:-----|:-------|
| 1 | Create `/client/src/pages/RegulatoryDashboard.jsx` |
| 2 | Paste scaffold above |
| 3 | Save |
| 4 | Add `<Route path="/regulatory-dashboard" component={RegulatoryDashboard} />` to your `/client/src/App.jsx` |
| 5 | Restart Replit frontend |
| 6 | Visit `/regulatory-dashboard` |

âœ… Boom â€” TrialSage's real SaaS regulatory AI brain begins!
