🔍 Industry Challenges in Clinical Trial Protocol Design
1. High Costs and Complexity
Average Cost per Patient: Approximately $41,413 (anjusoftware.com)​

Daily Cost of Clinical Trials:

Phase I: $7,829 per day​

Phase II: $23,737 per day​

Phase III: $55,716 per day (appliedclinicaltrialsonline.com)​

2. Regulatory and Financial Reporting Challenges
FASB Guidelines: Under ASC 730, most R&D costs must be expensed as incurred unless they have an alternative future use (viewpoint.pwc.com)​

Tax Implications: The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act requires capitalization and amortization of R&D costs over five years, impacting cash flow and financial statements (rsmus.com)​

🧠 TrialSage's Innovative Approach
1. AI-Driven Protocol Optimization
Real-Time Analysis: Utilizes AI to analyze and optimize trial protocols, reducing design time and costs​

Benchmarking: Compares protocols against a vast database of Clinical Study Reports (CSRs) to identify best practices​

2. Financial and Regulatory Alignment
FASB Compliance: Generates documentation that supports capitalization of certain R&D costs, aligning with ASC 730 guidelines​

ROI Demonstration: Provides clear metrics on cost savings and efficiency gains, aiding in financial reporting and investor communications​

📘 Enhanced Use Case Example: "First-In-Human IND Readiness"
