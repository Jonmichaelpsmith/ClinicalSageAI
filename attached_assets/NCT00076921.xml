  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>To characterize the development of tobacco control capacity with staff from the Chinese&#xd;
Center's for Disease control (CDCs) at the provincial level and to have them develop and&#xd;
implement population-level interventions to build awareness and knowledge concerning the&#xd;
harms of smoking that could help lead to policy action being taken to protect the&#xd;
population from the harms caused by smoking. Compare capacity, policy and, second-hand&#xd;
smoke exposure and smoking rates in selected provinces to national levels.</textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>China is a particularly critical country for global tobacco control. It has the world's&#xd;
largest number of smokers, approximately 350 million, and the immense market afforded by&#xd;
the 60 percent of men who smoke and the 95 percent of women who do not smoke represents a&#xd;
prize target for the multinational tobacco companies. China has ratified the Framework&#xd;
Convention for Tobacco Control (FCTC) and now needs to implement its provisions across a&#xd;
large and diverse population. In this application, we propose a program of evidence-based&#xd;
community interventions to be implemented at the province and local levels with the&#xd;
overall objective of developing an approach for implementation nationally.&#xd;
&#xd;
This application builds on a long-standing partnership between the Chinese Center for&#xd;
Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), the Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) and&#xd;
the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. That partnership began in 1995 with&#xd;
an agreement to collaborate on the conduct of China's 1996 national smoking survey. Our&#xd;
principal collaborator over those years, Dr. Gong-Huan Yang, is now Deputy Director of&#xd;
the China CDC and responsible for tobacco control at the national level. In the four&#xd;
years of funding to date from the Fogarty International Center (FIC), we have carried out&#xd;
a project in selected communities in three provinces, including urban and rural areas&#xd;
that provide a foundation for the intervention approach in this proposal. Specifically,&#xd;
we have carried out quantitative and qualitative studies to assess barriers to tobacco&#xd;
control and readiness for interventions, measured levels of airborne nicotine in key&#xd;
public environments, and developed capacity-building approaches. Our original FIC&#xd;
supported study involved three countries, China, Mexico and Brazil. However, this&#xd;
application will focus solely on China, as the latter two countries developed the&#xd;
necessary infrastructure and capacity to conduct research, publish their research&#xd;
findings, and seek further grants and government funding to sustain progress.&#xd;
&#xd;
This application proposes a tobacco control study that will involve 7 provinces in a&#xd;
CDC-led initiative to develop a systematic mix of approaches. The plan uses strategies&#xd;
based on experiences from our work in China and from the American Stop Smoking&#xd;
Intervention Study for Cancer Prevention (ASSIST) and anticipates barriers that have been&#xd;
identified in the data collected to date. In the intervention provinces, the China CDC&#xd;
will team with the provincial-level CDCs to assess capacity for tobacco control and the&#xd;
current status of tobacco control, using an adapted version of the Strength of Tobacco&#xd;
Control (SOTC) index developed for evaluating ASSIST. This systematic characterization&#xd;
will highlight capacity needs. An extensive capacity development program, based in&#xd;
distance-based methods, will be used. We have the overall objective of preparing the&#xd;
China CDC to implement a proven approach to tobacco control at the national level. A&#xd;
household survey will be conducted and compared to the national survey results.&#xd;
Second-hand smoking will be assessed in selected locations in the 7 provinces.</textblock>
