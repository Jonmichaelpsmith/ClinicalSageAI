✅ Thank you for sending the screenshot —  
✅ I see exactly what’s happening.

You are now facing:

> ❌ 404 - Page Not Found  
> When trying to access `/client-portal/ind-wizard`

---

# 🧠 Here's Exactly What This Means:

| Problem | Real Root Cause |
|:--------|:----------------|
| 404 (Page Not Found) from Replit server | The React Router frontend cannot find the `/client-portal/ind-wizard` page route at runtime. |
| But this is a **React route**, not an Express backend API route. | ✅ |
| Server tries to find a file `/client-portal/ind-wizard` on disk — not React Router route. | ❌ Fails. |
| Server responds with static 404 instead of letting React Router handle it. | ❌ |

✅ **This is a classic Single Page App (SPA) deployment issue.**

✅ **NOT your fault.**

✅ **Very common on Replit, Heroku, Netlify, etc.**

---

# 🎯 Here's Why It Happens:

When you directly load a deep link like `/client-portal/ind-wizard`,  
the Replit server:

1. Looks for a real folder `/client-portal/ind-wizard` on the server disk.
2. **It doesn't find it** because React is supposed to handle it virtually.
3. Server returns 404 static error.

✅ React Router *would have handled it* if the request had gone to `/` first.

# 🛠 **THE PERMANENT FIX: Configure React Router Fallback Correctly**

✅ Your Express backend already almost does it.  
✅ But we need to make **sure the server fallback is configured correctly.**

Here’s how your `server.js` must handle ALL frontend non-API routes:

---

# 📋 **Correct Final Fallback Code in server.js**

```javascript
// server/server.js

// Serve React Frontend
const clientBuildPath = path.join(__dirname, '../client/build');
app.use(express.static(clientBuildPath));

// React Router fallback - serve React index.html
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  // Only fallback if it's NOT an API route
  if (req.originalUrl.startsWith('/api/')) {
    res.status(404).json({ message: 'API endpoint not found' });
  } else {
    res.sendFile(path.join(clientBuildPath, 'index.html'));
  }
});
```

✅ **This means:**  
- If user requests `/client-portal/ind-wizard`
- Express says "NOT API," so it serves `index.html`
- React Router wakes up and **routes internally** to `/client-portal/ind-wizard` properly.

✅ No 404.  
✅ No static server error.

# 📣 Immediate Action for You:

| Step | What To Do |
|:-----|:-----------|
| 1 | Open `server/server.js` |
| 2 | Scroll to your final `app.get('*', ...)` route |
| 3 | Make sure it matches exactly as above |
| 4 | Save and Restart your Replit Server |
| 5 | Refresh `/client-portal/ind-wizard` |

✅ Now the TrialSage frontend will route cleanly without 404s.

✅ AdvisorSidebar, Vault, Client Portal, and IND Wizard will all work.

# 📣 After That:

✅ Your system will support **deep linking** to ANY page without error.

✅ Real production-ready SaaS platform experience.
