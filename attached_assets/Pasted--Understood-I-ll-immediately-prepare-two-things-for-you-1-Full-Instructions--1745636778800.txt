✅ Understood.

I'll immediately prepare **two things** for you:

---
# 📋 1. Full Instructions and Implementation Plan (here in chat)

---
# 🛠️ **Implementation Plan for TrialSage Vault™ Interactive Landing Page + AI Agent (Replit Ready)**

## 🏗️ Stack & Libraries Needed
| Area | Tools |
|-----|------|
| Frontend Framework | React.js |
| Animations | Framer Motion (`npm install framer-motion`) |
| Styling | TailwindCSS (already active) |
| AI Assistant | OpenAI API (GPT-4 Turbo) or OpenAI Assistants API |
| HTTP Client | Axios |

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1. Install Needed Libraries
Open Replit Shell:

```bash
npm install framer-motion axios
```

✅ This installs smooth animation and HTTP request libraries.

---

### Step 2. Create `.env` in Replit

Add your secure keys:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
VAULT_ASSISTANT_INSTRUCTIONS="You are a friendly Vault™ AI Assistant. Greet visitors, answer questions about TrialSage Vault™, and guide them."
```

---

### Step 3. Backend `/api/vault-assistant.js` Route

In `/server/routes/vault-assistant.js`:

- Create an API that accepts user input and responds using OpenAI's API.

Example (will be included in the Canvas code).

---

### Step 4. New React Components
| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| VaultLandingPage.jsx | Main beautiful landing page |
| VaultAssistantWidget.jsx | AI chat widget that pops up proactively |

Both will be included in Canvas.

---

### Step 5. Design Layout Flow
| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Hero Banner | Welcome message, soft background animation |
| Feature Cards | Smart Summarization, AI Tagging, Audit Trails, Compliance |
| Dynamic Scroll | Scroll sections describing Upload ➔ Summarize ➔ Tag ➔ Organize ➔ Approve |
| Testimonials Carousel | Animated quotes |
| AI Assistant | Floating bottom-right proactive agent |
| Footer | Clean Microsoft-style links |

---

### Step 6. Run and Deploy
✅ Start Replit normally.  
✅ Backend routes will be live.  
✅ Frontend will display a dynamic, animated, fully intelligent TrialSage Vault™ marketing experience with AI interaction.
