Perfect — full CTO mode activated.
I’ll now move through all of them sequentially, like a real engineering lead building this system for you.

Here’s the execution plan:

Step	Task	Purpose
1	Build first real GPT Prompt + Function Schema for IND Wizard AI Agent	Start making the Wizard intelligent
2	Draft Regulatory Brain Database Architecture	Build Phase 0 — the living regulatory core
3	Blueprint Folder + XML Generator Engine	Foundation for true eCTD automation

I’ll move through them in order without stopping unless you interrupt.

Step 1: First Real GPT Prompt + Function Schema for IND Wizard AI Agent

⸻

A. Prompt Design — Intelligent IND Builder (Assistant)

System Prompt (for GPT Assistant):

You are a senior FDA Regulatory Affairs Specialist assisting in building an IND submission.

Your role is to:
- Validate user entries live according to 21 CFR Part 312, FDA guidance, and ICH CTD rules.
- Predict missing information.
- Cite specific regulations.
- Suggest improvements in regulatory language.
- Extract metadata from uploaded documents.
- Prepare content for eCTD Module 1 packaging.

Always be formal, precise, non-chatty, and regulatory-focused.



⸻

Example User Prompt:

Here is the sponsor information form draft:

Sponsor Name: Concept2Cures.AI
Address: [blank]
Contact Person: Jon-Michael Smith
FDA Forms uploaded: No

What issues exist, and what next actions do you recommend?



⸻

Expected GPT Output:

{
  "validation_findings": [
    {
      "severity": "error",
      "issue": "Sponsor Address is missing. Required under 21 CFR 312.23(a)(1)(i).",
      "recommendation": "Prompt user to complete Sponsor Address to ensure filing acceptance."
    },
    {
      "severity": "error",
      "issue": "FDA Form 1571 has not been uploaded.",
      "recommendation": "Upload Form FDA 1571 to satisfy regulatory requirements per 21 CFR 312.23(a)(1)."
    }
  ],
  "extracted_metadata": {
    "sponsor_name": "Concept2Cures.AI",
    "contact_person": "Jon-Michael Smith"
  },
  "confidence_score": 63
}



⸻

B. Function Calling Schema (for API and GPT)

{
  "name": "validate_ind_sponsor_info",
  "description": "Validates Sponsor Information form fields for IND Wizard Module 1",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "sponsor_name": { "type": "string", "description": "Name of Sponsor Organization" },
      "address": { "type": "string", "description": "Sponsor Address" },
      "contact_person": { "type": "string", "description": "Primary Contact Name" },
      "fda_forms_uploaded": { "type": "boolean", "description": "Whether Forms 1571, 1572, 3674 are uploaded" }
    },
    "required": ["sponsor_name", "contact_person", "fda_forms_uploaded"]
  }
}



⸻

✅ Step 1 Done:
You now have the first GPT-4 Assistant prompt + function schema for real AI-powered IND validation.
Ready to plug into Assistants API or manual prompt system.

⸻

Step 2: Regulatory Brain Database Architecture

⸻

Goal

Create the intelligent searchable corpus that powers:
   •   Form validations,
   •   Live user guidance,
   •   Gap predictions,
   •   Risk warnings.

⸻

Core Data Architecture

Layer	Purpose	Tool Recommendation
Source Documents Layer	Ingest raw regulatory docs (CFR, FDA Guidance, ICH CTD)	Scraped into JSON/text
Preprocessing Layer	Chunk documents into meaningful semantic units (section-by-section)	LangChain / Custom Scripts
Embeddings Layer	Generate embeddings for each chunk for fast semantic search	OpenAI text-embedding-3-large
Vector Storage	Store embeddings for fast RAG retrieval	Pinecone or Weaviate
Metadata Index	Track version, update date, origin of each chunk	PostgreSQL side database
RAG Engine	Search, retrieve best matching guidance for user queries	Custom-built around OpenAI search



⸻

Key Datasets You Will Embed

Document Set	Source
21 CFR Part 312 (INDs)	eCFR.gov
21 CFR Part 314 (NDAs)	eCFR.gov
21 CFR Part 601 (BLAs)	eCFR.gov
ICH M4 CTD Structure	ich.org
ICH E6(R2) GCP	ich.org
FDA Guidance Docs	fda.gov
FDA Warning Letters (optional)	fda.gov FOIA releases



⸻

Example Retrieval Flow (Semantic Search)

User enters Sponsor Address → 
→ GPT sends "Sponsor Address" → 
→ RAG engine finds "21 CFR 312.23(a)(1)(i)" → 
→ GPT validates that Sponsor Address is mandatory.



⸻

✅ Step 2 Done:
Regulatory Knowledge Base architecture now mapped for Phase 0 build.

⸻

Step 3: Folder + XML Generator Engine Blueprint

⸻

Purpose

Create the backend that automatically:
   •   Structures the eCTD folder tree,
   •   Places user documents correctly,
   •   Generates required XML files (index.xml, envelope.xml, etc.),
   •   Zips the entire structure for submission.

⸻

Major Components

Component	Purpose
FolderStructureBuilder	Dynamically create correct CTD folders (Modules 1-5)
DocumentMapper	Auto-map user-uploaded files into correct folder locations
XMLBackboneGenerator	Create index.xml, envelope.xml, stf.xml
Validator	Check folder, file, and XML structure against FDA ESG rules
ZipperService	Create final .zip file for client download or FDA submission



⸻

Example Pseudocode for Folder + XML Generator

def build_ectd_structure(user_documents):
    create_folders([
        "submission/0000/m1/us/1.1-forms",
        "submission/0000/m1/us/1.2-cover",
        "submission/0000/m1/us/1.3-administrative-information",
        "submission/0000/m2/summary",
        "submission/0000/m3/quality"
    ])
    
    for doc in user_documents:
        target_folder = map_to_ctd_folder(doc)
        save_document(doc, target_folder)

    generate_index_xml(user_documents)
    generate_envelope_xml(user_documents)
    zip_submission_package()



⸻

✅ Step 3 Done:
You now have the first complete blueprint for auto-generating real eCTD folders + metadata.

⸻

Summary:

Step	Status
1. GPT Prompt + Function Schema	✅ Complete
2. Regulatory Brain Architecture	✅ Complete
3. Folder + XML Generator Blueprint	✅ Complete



⸻

Immediate Next Options:

Would you like me now to:
   •   (a) Start writing the first real code files for these modules (starter templates)?
   •   (b) Draft a Client Demo Plan (how we will show early clients this revolutionary AI in action)?
   •   (c) Start preparing Regulatory Fine-Tuning Dataset Extraction Guides?

Pick (a), (b), (c) —
(or say “all in sequence” and I’ll lead again.)

What’s your next move?
(We are about to transition into coding if you want.)
