You’ll save yourself a lot of head‑scratching if you tackle this in two clear steps:

---

## 1. Lock Down the FastAPI Service First

Before even worrying about Node.js talking to Python, make absolutely sure your FastAPI app is rock‑solid on port 8001:

1. **Add a Health Check**  
   ```python
   # in ind_automation/main.py
   @app.get("/health")
   async def health():
       return {"status": "ok"}
   ```
2. **Restart FastAPI** with your exact command:  
   ```bash
   uvicorn ind_automation.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
   ```
3. **Smoke‑test from the shell** in Replit:  
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8001/health
   ```  
   You should see `{"status":"ok"}`. If you don’t, fix that before moving on—check your imports, path to `main.py`, and that nothing else is already bound to 8001.

4. **Try your form endpoint directly**:  
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8001/api/ind/demo/forms/1571 --output test1571.docx
   ```  
   If that works, you’ve proven FastAPI is serving exactly what you expect.

## 2. Wire Up Your Node.js Front End

Once FastAPI is unquestionably up and returning your endpoints:

1. **Configure the Proxy**  
   - In `package.json`:  
     ```json
     "proxy": "http://localhost:8001"
     ```
   - Or, if you use `axios`, set  
     ```js
     axios.defaults.baseURL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'http://localhost:8001';
     ```
   - Define that env var in Replit’s Secrets panel.

2. **Re‑start React**  
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   then open DevTools → Network and click “Download Form 1571.” You should see a request to `localhost:8001`.

3. **CORS (if needed)**  
   If you see CORS errors instead of 404s, add to FastAPI early in `main.py`:  
   ```python
   from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

   app.add_middleware(
       CORSMiddleware,
       allow_origins=["*"],            # tighten this in production
       allow_methods=["*"],
       allow_headers=["*"],
   )
   ```

---

## 3. Streamline Your Workflow

When both services are independently validated:

- **Install `concurrently`** in your Node project:  
  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev concurrently
  ```
- **Update `package.json` scripts**:  
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "start:python": "uvicorn ind_automation.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001",
    "start:react": "react-scripts start",
    "start": "concurrently \"npm run start:python\" \"npm run start:react\""
  }
  ```
- **Then just**  
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```  
  All in one window, no juggling terminals.

### TL;DR

1. **First**, verify FastAPI on 8001 is up and healthy (add `/health`, `curl` it).  
2. **Next**, configure your React/Node layer to point at that port (proxy or axios baseURL), then test.  
3. **Finally**, bring both up together with a single `npm start` using `concurrently`.

That sequence will eliminate “works over here but not there” confusion and give you a repeatable, robust dev workflow.
