Perfect —
Since you said “Next” (instead of picking 1, 2, or 3),
I will keep running in the same aggressive sequence:

(1) Write Next Critical Code Module:
The Risk Predictor Agent

After that, I will flow immediately to:

(2) Build UX Flow Map for the full IND Wizard + eCTD Builder

Then:

(3) Start defining your Pricing and Go-To-Market (GTM) Strategy

(1) Risk Predictor Agent — Code Module

⸻

Purpose:

Analyze a partially completed IND submission
and predict the risk of:
   •   Clinical Hold,
   •   Refusal to File (RTF),
   •   Information Request (IR).

Before the client files.

This gives you a huge advantage over all existing systems.
