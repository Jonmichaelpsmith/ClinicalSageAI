  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>The purpose of the phase 1 portion of the study is to determine the safe dose of S-1 and&#xd;
cisplatin that can be administered in gastric cancer patients.&#xd;
&#xd;
The purpose of the phase 2 portion of the study is to determine the antitumor activity of&#xd;
the S-1 and cisplatin regimen established from phase 1 in patients with advanced gastric&#xd;
cancer.</textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>S-1 is an oral fluoropyrimidine which combines tegafur (a 5-FU prodrug) with two classes&#xd;
of modulators which:&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  inhibit dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) and&#xd;
&#xd;
  -  block phosphorylation of 5-FU in gastrointestinal tissues.&#xd;
&#xd;
S-1 is designed to enhance the the clinical utility of an oral fluoropyrimidine while&#xd;
ameliorating the disadvantage of gastrointestinal toxicity.&#xd;
&#xd;
5-Fu and cisplatin have been used as a standard treatment in gastric cancer and&#xd;
preliminary data indicate that S-1 plus cisplatin may result in superior tolerability and&#xd;
efficacy in advanced gastric cancer.&#xd;
&#xd;
S-1 is currently approved in Japan for treatment of gastric cancer and head and neck&#xd;
cancer.</textblock>
