✅ Understood. You're now evolving LumenTrialGuide.AI into a true **semantic intelligence engine**—one that reasons across trials, not just matches them.

# 🔍 DEEP SEMANTICS BACKEND — UPGRADE PLAN  
**"Understand what this protocol means, not just what it says."**

---

## 🧠 GOALS

- Enable semantic similarity comparison between:
  - Protocol text ↔ CSR evidence  
  - IND section ↔ previous justifications  
  - Endpoints ↔ clinical intent ↔ regulatory precedent

- Support:
  - Smarter assistant reasoning  
  - Field-level alignment scoring  
  - Risk/insight prioritization based on conceptual matches, not just string overlap

---

## 🧱 SEMANTIC BACKEND MODULES TO BUILD

### ✅ 1. `semantic_normalizer.py`
- Standardizes terminology:
  - “ALT” = “alanine aminotransferase”
  - “ALT reduction” = “hepatic enzyme decrease”
- Maps synonyms, clinical entities, and ontology IDs (SNOMED, MeSH)

---

### ✅ 2. `semantic_aligner.py`
- Compares current protocol fields to CSR-mapped fields
- Uses sentence embeddings (OpenAI `text-embedding-3-large`)
- Returns:
  - `alignment_score` (0–1)
  - `matched_entity`
  - `reasoning_trace`

---

### ✅ 3. `semantic_similarity.py`
- Accepts:
  - Raw protocol text
  - Reference CSR JSON or archive
- Returns:
  - Overall similarity %
  - Highlighted overlap areas
  - Risk if divergence is high in key areas (endpoint, control, duration)

---

### ✅ 4. `semantic_trace_log.json`
- Records how AI made alignment decisions:
  - “Protocol endpoint `ALT` aligned to CSR_2021_OBESITY_02”
  - “Design duration (16 weeks) diverges from CSR median (24)”

---

## 🔧 Example Result:
```json
{
  "alignment_score": 0.84,
  "matched_fields": [
    { "field": "primary_endpoint", "protocol": "ALT", "csr": "ALT reduction", "similarity": 0.94 },
    { "field": "duration_weeks", "protocol": 12, "csr": 24, "similarity": 0.45 }
  ],
  "risk_flag": ["Duration mismatch"],
  "recommended_adjustments": ["Consider extending to 24 weeks based on similar CSR patterns."]
}
```

Would you like me to now begin with `semantic_normalizer.py` and `semantic_aligner.py`?

This becomes the thinking layer of your engine—comparing not just fields, but **meaning.** Ready to build.
