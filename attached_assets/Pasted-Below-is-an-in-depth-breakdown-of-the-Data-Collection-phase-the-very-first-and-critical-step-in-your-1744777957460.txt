Below is an in‑depth breakdown of the Data Collection phase—the very first and critical step—in your fully automated CER reporting module. This phase is responsible for gathering all publicly available safety, performance, and complaint data from various regulatory sources. The goal is to retrieve fresh, relevant data, which will later be normalized, analyzed, and compiled into a comprehensive Clinical Evaluation Report.

## Data Collection: Full Details

### 1. Overview

The Data Collection module is designed to automatically retrieve safety and complaint data from multiple public data sources using either public APIs or web scraping techniques. The main targets are:

- **FDA Device Complaint Database:**  
  Provides detailed information on device-related complaints, adverse events, and recall activities.

- **EU Eudamed:**  
  Although its functionality is partially available, it offers additional insights into device performance and complaints in the European market.

- **FDA FAERS (Adverse Event Reporting System):**  
  Contains comprehensive safety data for drugs, including adverse events, medication errors, and other pharmacovigilance information.

The automated data collection module is built to be modular, scheduled, and robust to handle differences in the data source structure and update frequencies.

### 2. Data Source Analysis

#### A. FDA Device Complaint Database

- **Source URL:**  
  [FDA Device Complaint DB](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfmaude/search.cfm)
  
- **Characteristics:**  
  - Primarily a web interface; not all sections have a dedicated public API.
  - Contains fields such as complaint details, device identifiers, event dates, and narrative descriptions.
  
- **Access Strategy:**  
  - **Web Scraping:** In the absence of an official API, use Python libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.  
  - **Query Parameters:** Users typically submit search criteria (like device code or manufacturer) via form submissions; your module must simulate these requests to extract the underlying HTML data.
  
- **Example Techniques:**  
  - Submit a POST or GET request with appropriate form data to simulate a search.
  - Parse the returned HTML to extract structured data such as complaint IDs, event dates, device descriptions, and narrative details.
  
- **Considerations:**  
  - Monitor for layout changes or anti-scraping measures (e.g., CAPTCHA).  
  - Implement retry logic and error handling in case the source is temporarily unavailable.

#### B. EU Eudamed

- **Source URL:**  
  [EU Eudamed](https://ec.europa.eu/tools/eudamed/eudamed)
  
- **Characteristics:**  
  - Provides some similar device-related data as FDA’s database but is not as comprehensive.
  - Limited functionality compared to FDA data, so it may provide supplementary information rather than core complaint data.
  
- **Access Strategy:**  
  - **API/Web Scraping:** Check if an API endpoint is available. If not, use web scraping to extract available data.
  - Since the EU version is partially in use, design the module to work with whatever data is available and handle missing fields gracefully.
  
- **Considerations:**  
  - EU data might need additional mapping to the FDA data fields if merging is required later.
  - Use caching to avoid repeatedly scraping if the data refresh rate is low.

#### C. FDA FAERS

- **Source URL:**  
  [FDA FAERS Analysis Tool](https://fis.fda.gov/sense/app/95239e26-e0be-42d9-a960-9a5f7f1c25ee/sheet/7a47a261-d58b-4203-a8aa-6d3021737452/state/analysis)
  
- **Characteristics:**  
  - FAERS provides extensive data on drug-related adverse events.
  - Typically, this data is also available through the [OpenFDA API](https://open.fda.gov/apis/drug/event/), though your provided link references a web-based dashboard.
  
- **Access Strategy:**  
  - **API Access:** Use the OpenFDA API for programmatically retrieving the data in JSON format. This is the recommended method when available.  
  - **Querying:** Construct queries using drug identifiers (NDC codes, FDA product codes) to filter the data for your CER.
  
- **Considerations:**  
  - Rate limits: OpenFDA imposes limits on how many requests can be made per minute—use caching and scheduled polling to manage this.
  - Data volume: FAERS datasets can be large, so plan to process incremental updates rather than fetching the entire dataset every time.

### 3. Implementation Details

#### A. Automated Data Access

- **Scheduling & Automation:**  
  - **Cron/Celery Beat:** Use a scheduling tool (e.g., Celery Beat) to regularly run data collection tasks. This ensures the system always uses up‑to‑date data.
  - **Error Handling:** Incorporate robust error handling with logging to capture any issues in fetching data (e.g., network errors, parsing failures).

- **Connector Modules:**  
  - Develop separate modules or functions for each data source. For example:
    - `fetch_fda_device_complaints(device_code)`: Scrapes the FDA Device Complaint DB.
    - `fetch_eudamed_data(device_code)`: Scrapes or queries the EU Eudamed.
    - `fetch_faers_data(drug_code)`: Uses the OpenFDA API or scrapes the FAERS dashboard as necessary.
    
  - **Unified Interface:**  
    Each connector should return data in a standardized JSON format, which the ETL pipeline can then consume and transform.

#### B. Data Extraction Techniques

- **Web Scraping Example (FDA Device Complaint):**
  ```python
  import requests
  from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

  def fetch_fda_device_complaints(device_code):
      # Simulate a search by constructing a query URL
      url = f"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfmaude/search.cfm?query={device_code}"
      response = requests.get(url)
      response.raise_for_status()
      
      soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
      # Extract table rows from the HTML
      complaints = []
      table = soup.find('table', {'id': 'resultTable'})
      if table:
          for row in table.find_all('tr')[1:]:
              cols = row.find_all('td')
              complaint = {
                  "complaint_id": cols[0].get_text(strip=True),
                  "device_name": cols[1].get_text(strip=True),
                  "complaint_date": cols[2].get_text(strip=True),
                  "narrative": cols[3].get_text(strip=True)
              }
              complaints.append(complaint)
      return complaints
  ```
  *This is a simplistic example; real implementation might require session management, headers, and more sophisticated parsing.*

- **API Access Example (FDA FAERS via OpenFDA):**
  ```python
  import requests

  def fetch_faers_data(drug_code, limit=100):
      url = f"https://api.fda.gov/drug/event.json?search=openfda.product_ndc:{drug_code}&limit={limit}"
      response = requests.get(url)
      response.raise_for_status()
      return response.json()
  ```

#### C. Data Aggregation and Caching

- **ETL Processing:**  
  After data is extracted, transform it into a common schema:
  - Normalize date formats.
  - Map field names (e.g., “complaint_date” vs. “receipt_date”).
  - Aggregate counts or merge data with similar identifiers.
  
- **Caching:**  
  Use persistent caching (like Redis) to store the fetched data:
  ```python
  from redis_cache import set_cache, get_cache

  def fetch_and_cache_fda_data(drug_code, limit=100):
      cache_key = f"fda_faers_{drug_code}_{limit}"
      data = get_cache(cache_key)
      if data:
          return data
      data = fetch_faers_data(drug_code, limit)
      set_cache(cache_key, data, ttl=300)  # Cache for 5 minutes
      return data
  ```
  This caching approach minimizes repeated requests, especially for large datasets that do not change frequently.

### 4. Finalizing the Data Collection Module

By combining the techniques above, your Data Collection module would:

1. **Receive a user-input code** (drug or device code).
2. **Determine the relevant sources** (e.g., device code → FDA Device Complaint and EU Eudamed; drug code → FAERS).
3. **Invoke the corresponding connector functions** to pull data.
4. **Normalize and aggregate the data** into a unified JSON format.
5. **Store the raw and normalized data** in persistent cache (e.g., Redis) and possibly a database for historical tracking.
6. **Log any errors or data source changes,** and schedule periodic refreshes via a background scheduler.

---

### Summary

The Data Collection phase is critical as it lays the foundation for the entire CER reporting module. It involves automated, scheduled data retrieval from multiple public data sources (FDA Device Complaint DB, EU Eudamed, and FDA FAERS), applying appropriate extraction techniques (web scraping or API consumption), normalizing and aggregating the data, and caching the information for performance. The entire process is designed for minimal manual intervention—ensuring that when a user inputs a drug or device code, the system can rapidly gather and process all pertinent public data into a single, comprehensive dataset that will eventually be transformed into the CER.
