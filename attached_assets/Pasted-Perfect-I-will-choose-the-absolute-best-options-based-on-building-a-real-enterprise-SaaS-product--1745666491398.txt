# Architecture and Technology Choices for TrialSage Vault

Building the TrialSage Vault SaaS on Replit with an enterprise-ready architecture requires choosing technologies that maximize **scalability**, **security**, and **user experience**. Below we outline the best choices for the database layer, authentication method, and the initial core modules to develop, based on current SaaS best practices.

## Database Layer: MongoDB Atlas vs. Supabase (Postgres)

**Relational vs NoSQL:** TrialSage Vault will manage structured data (users, documents, metadata, audit logs, etc.) and enforce relationships and integrity (e.g. documents linked to trials, user permissions). A relational database is well-suited here for its ACID transactions and schema consistency. NoSQL (MongoDB Atlas) offers flexibility for unstructured data and easy horizontal scaling, but it trades off some consistency and requires more work to implement relational features (like multi-document transactions or complex joins). In contrast, Supabase (which is built on PostgreSQL) provides a robust relational engine plus modern cloud features ([Is Supabase Better Than MongoDB?. Introduction: | by Content Crafters | Medium](https://medium.com/@contentcrafters700/is-supabase-better-than-mongodb-25034dce7227#:~:text=Use%20Cases%3A)). For example, Supabase is great for applications needing structured relational data and real-time updates, whereas MongoDB excels for projects with highly flexible or schema-less data ([Is Supabase Better Than MongoDB?. Introduction: | by Content Crafters | Medium](https://medium.com/@contentcrafters700/is-supabase-better-than-mongodb-25034dce7227#:~:text=Use%20Cases%3A)).

**Supabase (Postgres) Advantages:** Supabase offers an all-in-one **Backend-as-a-Service** on top of PostgreSQL. This means in addition to a powerful SQL database, you get built-in APIs, real-time subscriptions, authentication, and file storage out-of-the-box ([Migrating from the MongoDB Data API to Supabase](https://supabase.com/blog/migrating-mongodb-data-api-with-supabase#:~:text=Supabase%20is%20an%20open,alternative%20and%20offers)). These integrated services significantly reduce development effort and ensure consistency across the stack. Notably, Supabase automatically generates RESTful APIs for your data and supports real-time listening to DB changes, features that would require additional setup with MongoDB Atlas ([Migrating from the MongoDB Data API to Supabase](https://supabase.com/blog/migrating-mongodb-data-api-with-supabase#:~:text=,and%20serverless%20functions%E2%80%94all%20tightly%20integrated)). PostgreSQL itself is a proven, **powerful and scalable database** engine ([Migrating from the MongoDB Data API to Supabase](https://supabase.com/blog/migrating-mongodb-data-api-with-supabase#:~:text=Supabase%20is%20an%20ideal%20replacement,offering%20a%20simplified%20transition%20path)), trusted in enterprise environments for handling large volumes of transactions. Supabase also supports **Row-Level Security (RLS)** and fine-grained Role-Based Access Control, which are crucial for multi-tenant SaaS security (e.g. ensuring one client’s data cannot be seen by another). In addition, using a relational model makes it easier to implement complex queries (such as searching documents by multiple tags, or joining documents with user roles and audit logs) using SQL.

**MongoDB Atlas Considerations:** MongoDB Atlas is a fully-managed NoSQL database and is very scalable for large, unstructured datasets. It allows schema-less document storage and easy sharding for horizontal scale. However, in this use-case the data has an inherent structure (documents with metadata, user associations, workflow states, etc.), which would either lead to *pseudo-relational* designs in Mongo or lots of embedded documents that can become complex to manage. Atlas by itself is mainly a database – additional features like user auth or file storage would require separate services or custom implementation. Given TrialSage’s enterprise focus, the strong consistency and transactional support of Postgres (for e.g. logging an upload *and* its audit entry in one transaction) is very appealing.

**Recommendation – **Use **Supabase (Postgres)** as the primary database platform. It combines the reliability of PostgreSQL with a rich set of integrated features ideal for SaaS:
- **Scalability:** Managed Postgres can scale vertically and (with read replicas or clustering) horizontally as needed, and Supabase’s managed service handles performance tuning (it’s built on one of the world’s most scalable databases ([Migrating from the MongoDB Data API to Supabase](https://supabase.com/blog/migrating-mongodb-data-api-with-supabase#:~:text=Supabase%20is%20an%20ideal%20replacement,offering%20a%20simplified%20transition%20path))). For extremely large file data, we can offload to cloud storage, keeping the DB for metadata and references.
- **Security:** Built-in RLS and enterprise-grade security compliance (Supabase is SOC2 certified ([Migrating from the MongoDB Data API to Supabase](https://supabase.com/blog/migrating-mongodb-data-api-with-supabase#:~:text=Footer))) help meet enterprise requirements. Data integrity (foreign keys, constraints) will prevent issues that could arise with schema-less storage.
- **Developer Velocity:** Supabase providing auth, storage, and serverless functions means we can prototype and build features faster ([Migrating from the MongoDB Data API to Supabase](https://supabase.com/blog/migrating-mongodb-data-api-with-supabase#:~:text=,and%20serverless%20functions%E2%80%94all%20tightly%20integrated)). This reduces time to deliver a secure and feature-rich product.
- **Flexibility:** If we need some schema flexibility, PostgreSQL supports JSONB columns, giving some NoSQL-like capability within a relational structure.

Overall, Supabase (Postgres) will deliver a **more enterprise-ready** foundation for TrialSage Vault than MongoDB Atlas, given the needs for structured data, strict security, and integrated platform services.

## Authentication Strategy: JWT Tokens and Social Login

**JWT for Stateless Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) should be used as the core of the authentication system. JWTs allow us to implement **stateless, scalable sessions** – once a user logs in and receives a signed token, subsequent requests can be authenticated by simply verifying the token signature, without hitting a central session store. This stateless nature makes horizontal scaling straightforward (any server instance can validate the token) ([Basic vs. JWT-Based Authentication: What’s the Difference?](https://www.descope.com/blog/post/basic-vs-jwt#:~:text=match%20at%20L565%20scalability,careful%20token%20management%20to%20avoid)). It also aligns well with microservice architectures, where each service can trust the token’s claims (user ID, roles, etc.) without additional calls. JWTs can encapsulate user permissions and identity, and since they are signed (and optionally encrypted), they are **tamper-proof** and secure ([Basic vs. JWT-Based Authentication: What’s the Difference?](https://www.descope.com/blog/post/basic-vs-jwt#:~:text=JWT,and%20used%20for%20subsequent%20requests)). We will enforce short token lifespans and use refresh tokens to maintain security (so stolen tokens expire quickly). By following industry best practices in token handling (secure storage on client side, HTTPS only, automatic refresh and revoke on logout), JWT-based auth will provide both security and scalability.

**Social Logins for User Experience:** We recommend offering **social login options** (OAuth-based logins) alongside a standard email/password login. Social logins (e.g. “Sign in with Google”, and possibly Apple or LinkedIn for a business context) greatly streamline the user experience. Users often prefer not creating yet another password, and if they’re already logged into Google/Apple, it becomes a one-click signup or login flow. This reduces friction especially on mobile devices, where typing credentials is tedious ([Social Login: Definition, Pros & Cons, Examples](https://www.descope.com/learn/post/social-login#:~:text=arrive%20already%20logged%20into%20Google,login%20a%20natural%20entry%20point)) ([Social Login: Definition, Pros & Cons, Examples](https://www.descope.com/learn/post/social-login#:~:text=The%20case%20for%20simplicity%3A%20Google,One%20Tap)). When properly implemented, social login can *enhance security* while improving UX ([Social Login: Definition, Pros & Cons, Examples](https://www.descope.com/learn/post/social-login#:~:text=When%20properly%20implemented%2C%20social%20login,against%20potential%20attacks%20and%20misconfigurations)) – we are effectively outsourcing authentication to providers like Google that have very strong security measures (2FA, anomaly detection, etc.). In fact, using Google or Apple IDs means leveraging their sophisticated auth infrastructure ([Social Login: Definition, Pros & Cons, Examples](https://www.descope.com/learn/post/social-login#:~:text=When%20properly%20implemented%2C%20social%20login,against%20potential%20attacks%20and%20misconfigurations)), and it acts as a form of Single Sign-On. For TrialSage Vault’s enterprise readiness, we can include OAuth providers that make sense (Google is dominant with ~90% of social authentications ([Social Login: Definition, Pros & Cons, Examples](https://www.descope.com/learn/post/social-login#:~:text=%2A%20Google%20dominates%20with%2090.8,of%20social%20authentications)); if our target customers use Apple devices or corporate Google accounts, Google and Apple login cover most cases). We might also support GitHub or LinkedIn if targeting developers or corporate users, respectively, to increase convenience ([Social Login: Definition, Pros & Cons, Examples](https://www.descope.com/learn/post/social-login#:~:text=,GitHub%20login%3F%20Feels%20right)). 

Importantly, JWT and social login are **not mutually exclusive** – they complement each other. The recommended approach is: use an identity provider or our backend to handle login (whether via password or OAuth), then issue a JWT for the session. For example, a user could authenticate through Google OAuth, and our system would then generate a JWT containing their TrialSage Vault user ID and roles. This JWT is used for API calls. This approach is common in modern architectures: a web app can accept JWTs from multiple issuers (our own auth or Google, etc.) as needed ([Basic vs. JWT-Based Authentication: What’s the Difference?](https://www.descope.com/blog/post/basic-vs-jwt#:~:text=JWTs%20are%20typically%20specific%20to,from%20a%20shared%20authentication%20server)). 

**Secure Implementation:** We will use a well-tested library or service for managing JWTs and social logins instead of writing our own from scratch, to avoid pitfalls in OAuth flows. Supabase’s built-in authentication module is a great fit here as well – it supports email/password login and multiple OAuth providers (Google, Apple, GitHub, etc.) out-of-the-box ([Migrating from the MongoDB Data API to Supabase](https://supabase.com/blog/migrating-mongodb-data-api-with-supabase#:~:text=,and%20the%20power%20of%20AI)). Supabase will handle the OAuth flow and JWT issuance for us, and it comes with pre-built security (password hashing, email verification, etc.). It also integrates with the database’s RLS policies, meaning we can ensure users can only access their own data by default. This **combination of JWT-based auth with social login options** will give the best of both worlds: a scalable backend security mechanism and a frictionless front-end login experience. For enterprise clients that require it, the architecture can later extend to SSO integration (SAML/OIDC with corporate identity providers), since the system is already token-based and flexible.

## Initial Modules to Prioritize

With the core platform set up on a secure, scalable stack, the next step is to build the **critical modules** of TrialSage Vault. Focusing on the right features first will ensure we deliver value to users and meet enterprise requirements from day one. Below are the key modules (and their rationale) to build initially, roughly in order of priority:

1. **Document Upload & Secure Storage:** The vault’s foundation is the ability to ingest documents easily and safely. Users should be able to upload files (individual documents or bulk upload of many files) through a simple interface. Supporting bulk uploads is important for onboarding (e.g. migrating a large batch of trial documents at once) ([Glossary of Document Management Terms | Folderit](https://www.folderit.com/glossary/#:~:text=Bulk%20Document%20Upload)). On the back-end, the files will be stored in a scalable object storage (Supabase Storage or an S3 bucket) rather than in the database itself, to handle large file sizes efficiently. We’ll implement virus scanning and file type validations for security. Each upload will trigger creation of a metadata record in the database (document title, uploader, timestamps, etc.) and an entry in the audit log. Ensuring **secure storage** is key: files will be encrypted at rest, and access to them will be controlled (for example, using pre-signed URLs or Supabase’s storage access policies) so only authorized users can download them. This module directly impacts user experience – it must be reliable and fast (perhaps using background jobs for processing large files). By nailing document upload first, we give users a way to start populating the system with their content.

2. **Metadata Tagging & Search:** Simply storing documents isn’t enough; users need to organize and find them quickly. The metadata tagging module will allow users (or the system automatically) to tag documents with relevant attributes – e.g. document type, trial phase, department, keywords, or custom tags. This structured metadata makes documents easily **searchable and filterable**. For instance, a user might filter to see all documents tagged as “Protocol” or all files related to a specific clinical study. We can implement a search interface that leverages these tags and perhaps full-text search on document titles or contents. With our choice of Postgres, we can use its full-text search capabilities or add an indexed search service if needed for content. The metadata tagging can be integrated into the upload workflow (prompt the user to add tags or automatically extract certain metadata). In fact, modern capture workflows often handle classification and tagging automatically during ingestion ([Glossary of Document Management Terms | Folderit](https://www.folderit.com/glossary/#:~:text=A%20capture%20workflow%20is%20the,and%20storage%E2%80%94often%20without%20human%20intervention)). This greatly improves **user experience** – as the repository grows, users can quickly retrieve the information they need via filters or search, rather than combing through hundreds of files. Designing the metadata scheme early (with input from real use cases) ensures the system will scale in complexity (we can always add more fields or taxonomy later, thanks to the relational structure). In short, this module delivers organization and efficiency, which are essential for a positive Vault experience.

3. **Audit Trail & Activity Logging:** From day one, TrialSage Vault should record a robust **audit trail** of user and system actions. An audit trail is a chronological log of every significant event – document uploads, edits, views/downloads, permission changes, deletions, user logins, etc. ([Glossary of Document Management Terms | Folderit](https://www.folderit.com/glossary/#:~:text=Audit%20Trail)). Each log entry will capture **who** did **what** and **when** (and possibly **where**/how, such as IP address for security). This module is crucial for **security and compliance**: it provides accountability and transparency into the system’s usage. If a document is altered or deleted, administrators can trace back to see who performed the action ([Glossary of Document Management Terms | Folderit](https://www.folderit.com/glossary/#:~:text=An%20audit%20trail%20is%20a,detect%20anomalies%2C%20and%20maintain%20transparency)). In regulated industries (like life sciences or legal), audit logs are often required to meet standards (for example, FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliance requires a secure audit trail of electronic records). Implementing this early ensures we don’t miss important event data later – it’s much harder to retroactively fill in an audit log. For the implementation, these logs will be stored in the database (in an append-only table). We may also consider a separate logging service or append-only store if volume is high, but a relational table with proper indexing is fine initially. The audit trail will feed into admin dashboards or reports so that compliance officers can review activity. Emphasizing audit logging from the start sends a strong message about **enterprise readiness**, as it shows the platform is prepared for oversight and security monitoring.

4. **Document Lifecycle Management:** Enterprise content management requires controlling the **entire lifecycle** of documents from creation to archival (or deletion) ([Glossary of Document Management Terms | Folderit](https://www.folderit.com/glossary/#:~:text=Document%20Lifecycle%20Management)). In TrialSage Vault, we should build a module to manage document statuses and workflows. For example, a document may start as a *Draft*, then move to *In Review* (perhaps with an approval request to a supervisor), then *Approved/Final* for use, and eventually *Archived* or *Expired* after a certain date. Defining these states and allowed transitions (with appropriate user permissions at each step) will enforce consistency and compliance in how documents are handled. **Lifecycle rules** can be applied – e.g., send notifications for upcoming expiry, or prevent an *Archived* document from being edited. This module ties in closely with both metadata and audit trail: we store the status as part of metadata and log every status change in the audit trail (with timestamps and approver info). We’ll also include **version control** as part of lifecycle management – every time a document is updated or a new revision is uploaded, the system should retain the previous version (with timestamp and editor) ([Glossary of Document Management Terms | Folderit](https://www.folderit.com/glossary/#:~:text=Version%20Control)). This allows users to revert if needed and provides an edit history for compliance. Implementing lifecycle management early on ensures that even initial users begin with good governance of documents. It also unlocks features like electronic approvals and reviews, which are expected in an enterprise scenario (for example, a regulatory document might need a recorded approval before it’s considered final). By having lifecycle controls in place, TrialSage Vault will help companies **enforce their business processes and retention policies**, reducing manual errors and satisfying regulatory requirements for document handling ([Glossary of Document Management Terms | Folderit](https://www.folderit.com/glossary/#:~:text=Document%20Lifecycle%20Management)).

5. **AI-Powered Document Summarization:** A standout feature that will greatly enhance user experience is AI summarization of documents. This module would use a **machine learning/LLM service** to automatically generate a concise summary of a document’s content. The benefit is that users can quickly grasp the key points of lengthy documents without reading them end-to-end. This is especially useful for busy professionals reviewing large trial protocols, research reports, or legal documents – the AI can distill each file into a few sentences highlighting the main takeaways ([AI summarization | Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/use-cases/ai-summarization#:~:text=What%20is%20AI%20summarization%3F)). The advantage for users is **time saved and information at a glance**: they spend more time acting on insights rather than sifting through text ([AI summarization | Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/use-cases/ai-summarization#:~:text=The%20benefits%20of%20AI%20summarization,information%20instead%20of%20sifting%20through%C2%A0it)). To implement this, we can integrate with a reliable AI summarization API or service (such as OpenAI’s GPT models, or Google’s Vertex AI summarization ([AI summarization | Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/use-cases/ai-summarization#:~:text=The%20best%20AI%20for%20summarization,from%20text%20using%20summarization%20prompts))). Initially, we might run summarization as an asynchronous task when a document is uploaded or upon user request, storing the summary as part of the document’s metadata for quick retrieval. We must also consider data privacy here – if documents are sensitive, we’d ensure the AI service used complies with privacy standards (or allow an on-premise AI option later for highly sensitive clients). Starting with summarization as an optional but visible feature can differentiate TrialSage Vault from legacy systems. It provides a modern, intelligent touch to the platform. As the AI models improve, this feature could expand into semantic search (users asking questions and the system finding answers from the documents). In summary, AI summarization, while not as foundational as the above modules, is a high-impact feature for **user experience** and will position the product as a cutting-edge solution.

By focusing on these initial modules, we cover the critical needs:
- **Core functionality** (uploading and organizing documents),
- **Enterprise-grade security and compliance** (audit trails, controlled lifecycle, secure auth),
- **Outstanding user experience** (easy login, quick search via tags, AI insights).

Each module is chosen to deliver maximum value and to be scalable:
- The upload and tagging system ensures the platform can handle growing content efficiently.
- Audit and lifecycle features ensure we maintain integrity and compliance as usage scales to many users and documents.
- The use of stateless JWT auth and a managed database means the app servers can be scaled out without bottleneck, and the data layer can grow or be optimized as queries increase ([Basic vs. JWT-Based Authentication: What’s the Difference?](https://www.descope.com/blog/post/basic-vs-jwt#:~:text=match%20at%20L565%20scalability,careful%20token%20management%20to%20avoid)).
- Replit will be our development environment for rapid iteration, but the chosen architecture (cloud database, stateless services) will allow easy migration to robust cloud hosting when we move to production scale. Using Replit’s secret management for API keys and environment variables will keep credentials secure during development.

In conclusion, the **best architecture** for TrialSage Vault is one that leverages a **modern managed relational backend (Supabase/Postgres)** for reliability and speed, implements **flexible yet secure authentication (JWT + social login)** for great UX and scalability, and delivers the fundamental **document management features** (upload, tagging, audit logging, lifecycle, AI summaries) that users and enterprises expect. This approach ensures that from day one, TrialSage Vault is prepared to **scale to thousands of users**, guard sensitive trial data with robust security, and offer a smooth, powerful user experience that stands out in the SaaS market. All choices are guided by current best practices and the expectation of **enterprise SaaS readiness**, setting a strong foundation for future growth and advanced capabilities.
