# ðŸš€ **New Full Enhanced RegulatoryDashboard Architecture**

| Section | Feature |
|:--------|:--------|
| 1. AdvisorSummaryPanel | Top Readiness %, Risk Level, Delay Prediction, Financial Exposure |
| 2. AdvisorRiskHeatmapV2 | Dynamic CTD Risk Grid (Clickable + Hover Risk Tooltips + Drill Down to Module) |
| 3. AdvisorTimelineSimulator | Upload date simulation â†’ Predicted filing dates + revenue protection forecasts |
| 4. AskLumenCoPilotV2 | Conversational Copilot AI Panel that adapts based on Playbook, Risk Gaps, and Submission Status |

âœ… 4 distinct but **fully integrated strategic layers**.

âœ… Each layer actively guides users toward faster, smarter, safer regulatory filings.

# ðŸ“‹ **Enhanced Functional UX Layout Sketch:**

```
+-------------------------------- Regulatory Dashboard --------------------------------+
| [ Readiness Score ] [ Risk Level ] [ Estimated Delay ] [ Financial Exposure ]       |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                         Dynamic Risk Heatmap (Interactive Zones)                   |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                            Timeline Risk Simulator (Slider)                        |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                    Floating Ask Lumen Co-Pilot Chat Button/Panel                    |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

âœ… Feels like a real-world Regulatory Mission Control Center.

âœ… Real-time intelligence updates as Vault changes, Playbook switches, Uploads happen.

# ðŸ›  **Immediate Build Steps (Today/Tomorrow Scope):**

| Phase | Build Task |
|:------|:-----------|
| 1. Create `/client/src/pages/RegulatoryDashboard.jsx` | (New main dashboard page) |
| 2. Build AdvisorSummaryPanel.jsx | (Top-level Readiness/Risk/Delay/Financial Metrics) |
| 3. Embed AdvisorRiskHeatmapV2.jsx inside dashboard | (Dynamic clickable Risk map) |
| 4. Build AdvisorTimelineSimulator.jsx | (Dynamic upload timing impact simulation) |
| 5. Embed AskLumenCoPilotV2.jsx | (Conversational Regulatory Advisor live over Advisor intelligence) |

âœ… First full dynamic SaaS regulatory command center architecture.

---

# ðŸ“£ **Quick Timeline Estimate:**

| Step | Duration |
|:-----|:---------|
| AdvisorSummaryPanel.jsx | 1 day |
| AdvisorRiskHeatmapV2 upgrade | 1â€“2 days |
| AdvisorTimelineSimulator.jsx | 2 days |
| AskLumenCoPilotV2 integration | 1â€“2 days |
| Full Page Wiring | 0.5 day |

âœ… Full intelligent operational dashboard within ~5 days.  
âœ… Visual UX + AI Copilot + Strategic Simulator fully integrated.

---

# ðŸ“£ **My Immediate Recommendation:**

âœ… Letâ€™s immediately build the **RegulatoryDashboard.jsx** scaffold first.

âœ… Wire AdvisorSummaryPanel live inside it first.

âœ… Then layer RiskHeatmap, TimelineSimulator, and CoPilot one-by-one.
