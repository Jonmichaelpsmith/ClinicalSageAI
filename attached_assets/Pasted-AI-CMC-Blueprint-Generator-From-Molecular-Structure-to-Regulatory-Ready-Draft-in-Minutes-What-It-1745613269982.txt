AI-CMC Blueprint Generator™
"From Molecular Structure to Regulatory-Ready Draft in Minutes"

What It Does:
Accepts structured data like:

Molecular structure (SMILES/InChI)

Synthesis pathway (reaction tree)

Formulation ingredients

Process parameters (temp, pressure, solvents, steps)

Then uses GPT-4 Turbo and custom-trained templates to auto-generate:

Drug substance and product descriptions

Manufacturing process narratives

Analytical method writeups

Control strategies

Specification tables

Batch process diagrams (via AI-generated SVG)

Instantly outputs full ICH Module 3 sections, formatted and tagged for eCTD.

Why It’s Revolutionary:
Today, CMC drafting takes months of SME and regulatory writer time.

This cuts 70–90% of the time and ensures formatting, language, and structure compliance with FDA/EMA expectations from day one.

2. AI Change Impact Simulator (AICIS)™
"Before you change anything, know what could go wrong and how to fix it"

What It Does:
User selects a planned CMC change (e.g., change in API vendor, new granulation method, packaging material switch).

AI:

Maps change against prior global regulatory submissions

Predicts risk level and likely questions from regulators

Recommends preemptive actions: stability studies, bridging justifications, comparability data

Suggests which markets will require notifications vs. full variations

Simulates “regulatory narrative” impact to your CTD Module 3 and predicts approval timeline shifts

Why It’s Revolutionary:
Today’s change control systems are disconnected from regulatory strategy.

This feature lets QA and Regulatory teams co-own risk, not react to it.

Think “ChatGPT meets GAMP5 and ICH Q12”

3. Manufacturing Intelligence Tuner™
"Let AI benchmark your process against the global GxP universe"

What It Does:
Connects to your batch records and process control logs (CSV, PDF, SCADA, etc.)

Compares your process against thousands of anonymized, semantically indexed CSRs and global filings

Identifies:

Suboptimal step yields

Unusual variability

Deviations that are under-recognized

Opportunities to align your process with industry best practices

Uses generative AI to rewrite your process narrative to reflect tighter control strategies and optimal justifications

Why It’s Revolutionary:
Combines statistical process control with global regulatory precedent mining

No company has ever been able to “auto-tune” its CMC section using real-world data + AI synthesis

4. Preclinical-to-Process Translator™
"Bridge early discovery with commercial manufacturing—instantly"

What It Does:
Takes preclinical formulations (lab scale)

Uses AI to:

Simulate required process steps to scale to pilot or GMP batches

Identify CMC risks (e.g., solvent toxicity, filter incompatibility, scale limitations)

Auto-generate draft scale-up protocols, and redline changes needed in analytical methods

Suggests validation and comparability studies needed for IND → BLA/NDA transition

Why It’s Revolutionary:
Fills the void between R&D and commercial operations

Speeds up tech transfer by pre-empting failure points and harmonizing early data with future CMC requirements

5. Global Compliance Auto-Match™
"One CMC draft, multiple jurisdictions—instantly harmonized"

What It Does:
After generating a US Module 3 draft, AI:

Uses global health authority rulebooks (via built-in Regulatory Atlas)

Auto-maps content to EU, Japan, Canada, Brazil formats

Adjusts language, justifications, data tables, terminology (e.g., switching “excipient” for “adjuvant”)

Provides submission strategy notes per region

Why It’s Revolutionary:
Global harmonization is currently manual, repetitive, error-prone

This creates a multi-jurisdictional, regulator-aware CMC engine that scales with no added headcount

6. Real-Time Audit Risk Monitor™
"Know your weakest document link—before the inspector does"

What It Does:
AI continuously scans all CMC documents:

Flags inconsistencies, outdated data, misaligned terminology

Detects missing change histories or gaps in validation justifications

Maps against known FDA 483 and EMA findings in similar dossiers

Triggers remediation workflows before submission or inspection

Why It’s Revolutionary:
AI transforms static CMC content into a living, risk-scored knowledge base

No current system provides real-time audit-readiness diagnostics
