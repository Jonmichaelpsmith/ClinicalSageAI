# 🛠️ **GitHub Repo Blueprint for TrialSage**

When you move TrialSage into GitHub (even if private),  
**it will protect your clean code**,  
**make future migrations 100x easier**,  
and **look professional** when you talk to investors, clients, or partners.

Here’s **exactly** how your GitHub repo should be structured.

## 📂 Repo Structure:

```

│   ├── public/
│   │   ├── index.html

# 📋 **Critical Files to Include:**

| File | Purpose |
|:-----|:--------|
| `.gitignore` | Ignore `node_modules/`, `/build/`, `/uploads/`, and local environment files. |
| `README.md` | Write a simple project overview (what is TrialSage, how to run locally). |
| `.env.example` | Blank version of your `.env` files, showing required environment vars (no secrets). |

---

# 🔥 Example `.gitignore` for TrialSage:

```
# Node modules
**/node_modules/

# Build outputs
/build/
/dist/
/uploads/

# Local environment secrets
.env
client/.env
server/.env

# System files
.DS_Store
*.log
```

# ✍️ Example README.md Starter:

# TrialSage

**TrialSage** is an AI-powered clinical trial intelligence platform built for modern biotech, pharma, and regulatory teams.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Authentication**: JWT local storage auth
- **Hosting**: Replit (currently); Migration-ready for Lovable/Vercel
- **Storage**: Local/Cloud uploads for CSR PDFs

## Local Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` inside `/client` and `/server`
3. Create `.env` files for client and server based on `.env.example`
4. Run the development server(s)
   - `npm run dev` inside `/client`
   - `npm start` inside `/server`

## Folder Structure
See `/client` for frontend and `/server` for backend services.

```

✅ This makes TrialSage immediately understandable to any developer, partner, investor, or customer you ever show it to.

# 🚀 **Your Launch Timeline with GitHub:**

| Step | Time Needed |
|:-----|:------------|
| Create a GitHub Repo (private) | 5 minutes |
| Upload clean folders | 10 minutes |
| Write basic README | 10 minutes |
| Add `.gitignore` | 2 minutes |
| Commit and push | 5 minutes |
| (Optional) Connect repo to Vercel or Lovable for auto-deploys | Later |

✅ Done! TrialSage is now version-controlled, secure, professional.

# 🎯 Would you like me next to also:

✅ Create **the .env.example files** for both frontend and backend (so you know exactly what environment variables you need)?  
✅ Write a **basic Deployment Script** you could use for Vercel, Lovable, or Render later?  
✅ Give you **starter GitHub Actions** if you want CI/CD later (optional but pro-level)?

**You can pick one, two, or all three.** 🚀  
(We’re making this *truly production-ready* step-by-step.)

👉 Which ones do you want next?  
**(Env examples? Deployment Script? GitHub Actions?)**  
Just say: **all** or pick! 🎯
