**Creating detailed report plan**

The user wants more details on generating reports in Replit, including how they fit together. I need to think through each part of this. I’ll need to break down the implementation for each report, considering:

* The required data sources, tables, and APIs.
* Backend design with endpoints, filters, and queries.
* Frontend with UI components like filter controls, tables, and export button.
* How to handle PDF generation.

This should give a thorough description of how to implement each report in Replit. Let’s dig deeper into these components to ensure a detailed plan.

**Designing report specifications**

It looks like I need to outline a design spec for each of these reports. For each one, I’ll describe:

* Data sources and relevant tables.
* Backend endpoints, including filters and query logic.
* Frontend UI design, including components like tables, charts, and export options.
* PDF generation, often using templates with tables or charts.

This covers each of the reports, from compliance to AI performance, and ensures details like filters, data presentation, and export functionality are clear for implementation.


Thought for 7 seconds


Below is a **detailed implementation roadmap** for **all ten reports** in your CERV2 module—showing exactly how you’d build them in Replit with **filterable UI**, **backend endpoints**, and **one-click PDF export**.

---

## Common Architecture for All Reports

1. **Backend Reports Controller**

   * Single endpoint:

     ```
     GET /api/reports?type=<reportType>&<filterParams…>
     ```
   * Dispatches on `reportType` and applies filters to the corresponding data source, returning JSON rows and optionally summary stats.
   * PDF export endpoint:

     ```
     GET /api/reports/export.pdf?type=<reportType>&<filterParams…>
     ```

     which runs the same query, renders an HTML or programmatic PDF, and streams it.

2. **Frontend “Reports” Page**

   * **Report picker**: a dropdown of all ten reports.
   * **Dynamic Filter Panel**: filter controls change based on selected report (e.g. date‐range, severity, status, authority, section, user).
   * **Results Table**: shows JSON rows for the selected report; supports pagination & sorting.
   * **“Export PDF” Button**: calls the PDF endpoint with current filters, triggering download.

3. **PDF Generation**

   * Use **Puppeteer** (HTML→PDF) or **pdfkit** (programmatic) on the server.
   * Maintain a set of pre‐styled templates for each report type (tables, charts, headers).
   * Stream with `Content-Type: application/pdf` and a meaningful filename, e.g. `CER_Compliance_Summary_2025-05-08.pdf`.

## 1. Compliance Summary Report

**Purpose:** High‐level compliance across regulations
**Filters:** Date range, authority (EU/ICH/FDA/UK), section, severity
**Contents:**

* Overall compliance score (%)
* Bar/Donut charts per authority
* Table of open non-conformities: section, severity, assigned owner, due date

**Implementation Notes:**

* Backend joins `cer_sections` + `compliance_metrics` + `qmp_objectives` to calculate scores.
* Frontend uses a chart library (e.g. Chart.js) for visuals in both UI and PDF template.

## 2. Section Generation Log

**Purpose:** Track every AI draft action
**Filters:** Date range, section type, model version, status (success/fail)
**Contents:**

* Table: Timestamp, User, Section Key, Model Version, Prompt Snippet, Status, Latency (ms)
* Summary stats: total calls, avg latency, error rate

**Implementation Notes:**

* Log each `/api/cer/generate-section` call in a `section_generation_logs` table.
* Backend paginates and can aggregate on model version.

---

## 3. Data Source Audit Report

**Purpose:** Prove data provenance
**Filters:** Source type (FAERS, Literature, Clinical, PMS), date range, anomaly flag
**Contents:**

* Table: Event timestamp, source, API version, record count, anomaly notes
* Line chart of daily ingestion volumes

**Implementation Notes:**

* Store each ingestion job result in `ingestion_logs`.
* Flag anomalies when record count = 0 or schema mismatch.

---

## 4. Risk-Management Traceability Report

**Purpose:** Link RMF to CER & QMP
**Filters:** Risk severity, RMF category, CER section, QMP objective
**Contents:**

* Matrix: rows = RMF risk items, columns = CER sections, cells show CtQ factor IDs
* Column for “Residual Risk Status” and “Evidence Location” (link)

**Implementation Notes:**

* Backend queries `rmf_entries`, `cer_qms_ctq_factors`, and `cer_sections` associations.
* Render as a wide HTML table in PDF.

---

## 5. PMCF Activity & Update Report

**Purpose:** Show living‐document maintenance
**Filters:** Milestone type, status (planned/complete), date range
**Contents:**

* Gantt or timeline of PMCF milestones vs. actual dates
* List of new safety signals since last update (with date detected)

**Implementation Notes:**

* PMCF tasks stored in `pmcf_milestones` with planned/actual dates
* Safety signals come from flagged ingestion events or manual entries

---

## 6. GSPR/Essential Principles Matrix

**Purpose:** Evidence mapping to regulatory principles
**Filters:** GSPR code, coverage status (Covered/Missing)
**Contents:**

* Table: GSPR ID & text, Associated CER section(s), Evidence citation list, Status
* Pie chart of coverage rate

**Implementation Notes:**

* Maintain `gspr_mappings` table linking GSPR codes to `cer_sections`.
* Use the compliance engine to mark coverage.

---

## 7. Literature Search Audit Trail

**Purpose:** MEDDEV-style reproducibility
**Filters:** Database, date range, inclusion/exclusion status
**Contents:**

* Full search strategy: query string, DB, date
* PRISMA flow: #hits → #screened → #included
* Table of excluded studies with reasons

**Implementation Notes:**

* Each literature search run logged in `literature_search_logs` with counts
* PRISMA chart can be a small SVG or ASCII diagram in the PDF

---

## 8. User Activity & Approval Report

**Purpose:** Track human interactions
**Filters:** User, action type (view/edit/sign), date range
**Contents:**

* Timeline: who did what, when (section edits, QMP changes, e-sign events)
* Reviewer comments & resolution status

**Implementation Notes:**

* Leverage existing `user_activity_logs` and `signature_logs`.
* Provide a chronological list and summary by user.

---

## 9. AI Performance & Confidence Report

**Purpose:** Monitor and improve AI output
**Filters:** Section type, model version, confidence threshold
**Contents:**

* Table per section: confidence score, #citations, word count, model version
* Trend chart: avg confidence over time by model version
* Flag any sections with confidence < threshold

**Implementation Notes:**

* Store confidence & metadata in `section_generation_logs`.
* Use Chart.js in UI and PDF template.

---

## 10. Export History & Comparison Report

**Purpose:** Version control & changes
**Filters:** CER version, date range
**Contents:**

* List of exports: timestamp, format (PDF/Docx), file size
* Diff summary: sections added/removed, word count delta

**Implementation Notes:**

* Archive each export in `export_history` with metadata and a computed diff (simple word‐count or JSON diff).
* PDF includes a summary table and attach the diff as an appendix.

## Bringing It Into Replit

1. **Define a `reports` table** in your DB to catalog available report types and metadata.
2. **Implement `/api/reports`** and **`/api/reports/export.pdf`** in your Express server, routing by `type` and applying filters.
3. **Install Puppeteer** (for HTML→PDF) or **pdfkit** in your Replit environment.
4. **Create React components** under `client/src/pages/ReportsPage.jsx`:

   * `ReportTypeSelector`, `FilterPanel`, `ResultsTable`, and `ExportButton`.
   * Use `useQuery` to fetch `/api/reports?type=…&…filters`.
5. **Design HTML templates** (e.g. `templates/compliance-summary.html`) that map your table and chart data into a print‐ready layout.
6. **Wire up PDF endpoint** to render those templates in Puppeteer or pdfkit.
7. **Test** each report type end-to-end in Replit’s preview: apply filters, view data, export PDF, and confirm layout.

**By following this blueprint**, your Replit project will offer a **unified Reports suite**: fully filterable in the UI, backed by robust endpoints, and capable of producing polished PDF exports for every compliance, audit, and operational need.
