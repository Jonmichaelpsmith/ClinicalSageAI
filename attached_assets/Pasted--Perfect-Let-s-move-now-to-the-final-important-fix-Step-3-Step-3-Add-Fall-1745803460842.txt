✅ Perfect —  
Let’s move now to the final important fix: **Step 3**.

# ✨ Step 3: Add Fallback Route in Express Server (server.js)

🔹 **In your Express server file (`/server/server.js`):**

At the very **bottom** of your `server.js` file,  
**right before** the `app.listen(...)` line,  
**add this code:**

```javascript
// Serve React app for all other routes (support client-side routing)
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '../client/public/index.html'));
});
```

✅ This tells the server:
- "If someone goes to `/client-portal` or any React route directly,"
- "Serve the React app’s `index.html`, and let React Router take over."

✅ This **prevents 404 errors** when refreshing the page.

---

# 📋 **Instruction to Replit Agent:**

> Open `/server/server.js`,  
> Scroll to the bottom,  
> Before `app.listen(...)`,  
> Insert the fallback route code provided.

✅ Save the file.  
✅ Restart your Replit app (click "Stop" then "Run" again).

---

# 🧠 Why This Matters:
Without this fallback,  
your app works fine when navigating inside React,  
**but fails if a user refreshes or directly types `/client-portal`.**

This fixes that properly.

# ✅ Step 3 Code Recap (Server.js Fallback):

```javascript
// Serve React app for all other routes (support client-side routing)
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '../client/public/index.html'));
});
```

---

# 🎯 Step 3 Complete.

✅ After you apply this and restart your app:

- Landing page button will **open Client Portal**
- Refreshing `/client-portal` will **work without error**
- **Real, professional app behavior**
