Okay, I see you're moving away from react-toastify and implementing your own custom toast notification system along with some broader security measures. Let's review the code you've provided in client/src/components/security/SecureToast.jsx and client/src/server-security.js.

However, it seems you've provided a comprehensive set of security-related files (security.js, api-security.js, secure-storage.js, server-security.js, and SecurityProvider.jsx) instead of the SecureToast.jsx file I was expecting based on your previous message about creating a custom toast.

Let's focus on the provided security-related code for now.

Overall Observations:

You've implemented a multi-layered approach to security, which is excellent. It covers client-side and server-side aspects, addressing common vulnerabilities. Here's a breakdown of each file:

1. security.js (Client-Side Security Library):

Encryption (encryptData, decryptData): Using AES for encrypting data client-side. This is a good practice for sensitive information before storing it locally.
Potential Issue: The encryption key is being pulled from an environment variable with a default value. While convenient, ensure that the VITE_ENCRYPTION_KEY is securely managed in production and that the default key is only for development.
Secure Local Storage (secureLocalStorage): Encrypting data before storing it in localStorage significantly enhances security compared to plain text.
Content Security Policy (setupCSP): Dynamically setting the CSP in the <head> is a good way to control the resources the browser is allowed to load, mitigating XSS attacks. The defined policy looks reasonable.
XSS Prevention (sanitizeInput): Basic input sanitization to prevent common XSS vectors. Consider using a more robust sanitization library if you handle complex HTML or user-generated content.
Session Timeout (setupSessionTimeout): Implementing session timeouts based on inactivity is crucial for security. Storing the expiry time in secureLocalStorage is a good approach.
2. api-security.js (API Security Enhancement):

Rate Limiting (checkRateLimit): Client-side rate limiting can help prevent abuse and DoS attacks. However, remember that client-side controls can be bypassed, so server-side rate limiting is also essential (as seen in server-security.js).
Secure Request Headers (generateSecureHeaders): This function generates headers for CSRF protection (if a token is available), adds a timestamp and nonce to prevent replay attacks, and includes a signature for request integrity. This is a strong security measure.
Potential Issue: The signature is generated client-side. While it adds a layer of protection, the secret key used for encryptData is potentially exposed client-side. A more robust approach might involve server-side signing if the integrity check is critical.
Nonce Generation (generateNonce): Using window.crypto.getRandomValues for generating cryptographically secure nonces is excellent.
Enhanced Fetch (secureFetch): This function integrates rate limiting and secure headers into the fetch API, making it easier to perform secure API requests.
3. secure-storage.js (Secure Storage Implementation):

Enhanced Secure Set (secureSet): This function encrypts data along with metadata (timestamp, origin, checksum) before storing it. This adds integrity checks and helps prevent tampering and cross-site attacks.
Retrieve and Verify Data (secureGet): This function decrypts the data, verifies its integrity using the checksum, and checks the origin. This is a very secure way to handle local storage.
Secure Key Generation (getSecureKey - not shown): Assuming this function adds a prefix or performs some transformation on the key to further secure it.
Secure Remove (secureRemove - not shown): Presumably removes the secure item from storage.
4. server-security.js (Server-Side Security):

Helmet Middleware: Utilizing Helmet is a best practice for setting various security-related HTTP headers. The configured directives for contentSecurityPolicy, xssFilter, hsts, and referrerPolicy are well-chosen.
Nonce for CSP: Generating a unique nonce per request and making it available in res.locals for use in the CSP header is the correct way to use nonces for script and style tags to prevent inline script injection.
Rate Limiting (express-rate-limit): Implementing rate limiting on the server-side is crucial for preventing abuse. Separate limiters for general API and authentication endpoints are a good idea.
CSRF Protection (csurf): Using the csurf middleware with cookie-based storage is a standard way to protect against cross-site request forgery attacks. The cookie configuration (HTTP-only, SameSite strict, secure in production) is correct.
5. SecurityProvider.jsx (Security Context Provider):

Security Context: Creating a context to manage security-related state (initialized, sessionActive, csrfToken) makes it easy to access this information throughout your application.
CSRF Token Generation and Meta Tag: Generating a CSRF token on the client-side and adding it as a meta tag is a common way to make it available for form submissions. Storing it in localStorage as a fallback is also sensible.
Session Timeout Implementation: The useEffect hook sets up the CSP, generates the CSRF token, and starts the session timeout mechanism. The modal for session expiry provides a good user experience.
Potential Issues and Areas for Improvement (across all files):

Key Management: The client-side encryption key's management needs careful consideration. Embedding it in the environment variables (even with Vite's handling) might not be the most secure approach for highly sensitive data. Consider more robust key management strategies if the data sensitivity warrants it.
Server-Side Encryption: While client-side encryption adds a layer of protection, end-to-end encryption (where data is also encrypted on the server at rest and in transit using secure protocols like HTTPS) is generally recommended for sensitive data.
Input Sanitization Robustness: For complex user inputs or if you're handling any form of rich text, consider using a more comprehensive and actively maintained sanitization library to prevent a wider range of XSS attacks.
Error Handling: While you have try...catch blocks, ensure you have a consistent and secure way of logging errors (preferably server-side) without exposing sensitive information to the client.
Dependency Updates: Regularly audit and update your dependencies (crypto-js, express-rate-limit, helmet, csurf) to patch any known security vulnerabilities.
Regarding the missing SecureToast.jsx:

Since you mentioned creating a custom toast implementation, I'd be interested to see how you're handling the display and removal of these notifications without relying on react-toastify. If you provide that code, I can review it for any potential issues or improvements.

Overall, you've made a strong start on implementing security measures in your application. Keep these considerations in mind as you continue to develop.

JavaScript

// client/src/components/security/SecureToast.jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react';
import './SecureToast.css'; // Import your custom toast styles

const ToastContext = React.createContext();

export const useToast = () => useContext(ToastContext);

export const ToastProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [toasts, setToasts] = useState([]);

  const showToast = useCallback((message, type = 'info', duration = 3000) => {
    const id = Date.now();
    setToasts((prevToasts) => [...prevToasts, { id, message, type }]);

    setTimeout(() => {
      setToasts((prevToasts) => prevToasts.filter((toast) => toast.id !== id));
    }, duration);
  }, []);

  return (
    <ToastContext.Provider value={{ showToast }}>
      <div className="toast-container">
        {toasts.map((toast) => (
          <div key={toast.id} className={`toast toast-${toast.type}`}>
            {toast.message}
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
      {children}
    </ToastContext.Provider>
  );
};
CSS

/* client/src/components/security/SecureToast.css */
.toast-container {
  position: fixed;
  top: 20px;
  right: 20px;
  z-index: 1000;
}

.toast {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  color: #333;
  padding: 12px 20px;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  border-radius: 4px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  opacity: 0;
  animation: slideIn 0.3s ease-out forwards, fadeOut 0.3s ease-in 2.7s forwards;
}

.toast-info {
  background-color: #e7f3ff;
  color: #31708f;
}

.toast-success {
  background-color: #d4edda;
  color: #155724;
}

.toast-warning {
  background-color: #fff3cd;
  color: #85640c;
}

.toast-error {
  background-color: #f8d7da;
  color: #721c24;
}

@keyframes slideIn {
  from {
    transform: translateX(100%);
    opacity: 0;
  }
  to {
    transform: translateX(0);
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

@keyframes fadeOut {
  from {
    opacity: 1;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 0;
  }
}
Now, to use this custom toast in your application, you'll need to:

Wrap your root component with ToastProvider in your App.jsx or main entry point:

JavaScript

// client/src/App.jsx
import React from 'react';
import { ToastProvider } from './components/security/SecureToast';
// ... other imports

function App() {
  return (
    <ToastProvider>
      {/* Your application components */}
    </ToastProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
Use the useToast hook in any component where you want to display a toast notification:

JavaScript

// client/src/someComponent.jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useToast } from './components/security/SecureToast';

function SomeComponent() {
  const { showToast } = useToast();

  const handleClick = () => {
    // Example usage:
    showToast('Data saved successfully!', 'success');
    // You can also use other types: 'info', 'warning', 'error'
    // showToast('Something went wrong.', 'error', 5000); // Custom duration
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>Save Data</button>
  );
}

export default SomeComponent;
This provides a basic custom toast notification system without relying on external libraries. You can further customize the styling and functionality in SecureToast.jsx and SecureToast.css to match your application's design.
