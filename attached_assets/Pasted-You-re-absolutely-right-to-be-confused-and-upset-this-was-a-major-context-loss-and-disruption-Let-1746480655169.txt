Youâ€™re absolutely right to be confused and upset â€” this was a major context loss and disruption. Let me give you a clear and complete overview of everything we built today, **where it is**, and how to **restore it immediately into your CER module**.

---

## âœ… WHAT WE BUILT TODAY (5/5)

### ðŸ”§ Backend (in `faers_cer_ingestion.py`)

This file now includes:

* `/api/cer/fetch-faers`: FAERS ingestion and comparator analysis (UNII + ATC)
* `/api/cer/export-docx`: Word export with FAERS + comparator summaries
* `/api/cer/export-pdf`: PDF export with all summary sections
* `/api/cer/generate-section`: GPT-4o-powered AI section generator
* `/api/cer/preview`: Full report preview assembly

ðŸŸ¢ **Location:** Open in canvas as `Faers Cer Ingestion` (you are NOT missing this)

---

### ðŸ§© React Frontend

#### `CerBuilderPanel.jsx` â€” Component that lets user:

* Select section type
* Enter context
* Generate AI sections via `/generate-section`
* Export as PDF or DOCX

ðŸŸ¢ **Stored as:** `CerBuilderPanel` in canvas

---

#### `CerPreviewPanel.jsx` â€” Component that:

* Displays full CER live preview
* Shows FAERS table
* Shows comparator benchmarking
* Renders AI-generated sections

ðŸŸ¢ **Stored as:** `CerPreviewPanel` in canvas

---

#### `CERV2Page.jsx` â€” Full CER module with:

* Instructional 3-step flow
* All CER state
* Embeds builder + preview panels

ðŸŸ¢ **Stored as:** `CERV2Page` (active in canvas)
ðŸ”´ But **Renamed as `CERV2Page_backup()`** by mistake in last step

---

## ðŸ›  FIX NOW

Let me:

1. âœ… Rename `CERV2Page_backup()` â†’ `CERV2Page()` (so it's live again)
2. âœ… Make sure builder + preview are shown in correct tabs/layout
3. âœ… Give you backup `.jsx` files to download and store

Iâ€™ll start with step 1 now.


âœ… Your main CER module has now been fully restored to `CERV2Page()` â€” itâ€™s the **official version** again and safe to use.

Next, Iâ€™ll give you `.jsx` backup files for:

* `CerBuilderPanel`
* `CerPreviewPanel`

Would you like those saved inside your `/client/src/components/cer/` directory with a `-backup.jsx` suffix, or bundled in a downloadable zip?
