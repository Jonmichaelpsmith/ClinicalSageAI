🔬 TRIALSAGE™ by Concept2Cures.AI
“The Clinical Intelligence System That Thinks Like a Biotech Founder.”
🧠 WHO WE ARE
We are former biotech operators, regulatory insiders, and AI scientists who were tired of watching brilliant therapies die in committee because of bad tools, fragmented processes, or slow submission timelines.

We built TrialSage not as a better document manager, not as another AI chatbot, and not as a clinical trial plugin—
But as a category-defining Clinical Intelligence System that solves the real problem:

Biotech’s success isn’t just about science.
It’s about how fast, how smart, and how confidently you get that science to regulators—and to patients.

🛑 WHAT WE’RE CHANGING
❌ Today’s Model Is Failing You:
CSRs are massive PDFs nobody reads in time.

CERs are manually rebuilt every cycle.

INDs take 12 months and $1M in consulting.

Protocol design is guesswork, not data.

Every tool is a silo. Every submission is a war room.

AI “assistants” don’t understand regulatory.

And yet, this is the standard. This is what biotech still pays for.

We’re done with that. And we think you are too.

✅ WHAT WE OFFER
TrialSage is a real-time, AI-powered platform that automates the parts of clinical and regulatory development that don’t need to be manual anymore—
and enhances the parts that do, with precision insight and smart, embedded copilots.

The Result:
You get a centralized operating system for protocol design, regulatory authoring, safety insight, and submission execution—backed by explainable AI trained on decades of clinical and agency knowledge.
