# ðŸ›  **InfoTooltip Text for CTD Module 3: Quality (CMC)**

âœ… First, remember you already have a reusable **InfoTooltip.jsx** component.

âœ… Now we insert the correct regulatory description text for CTD Module 3.

# ðŸ“‹ Here's the correct InfoTooltip text for Module 3:

```plaintext
Module 3: Quality (CMC Documentation)
This module contains detailed Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) information for the drug substance (API) and drug product (final formulation). It includes specifications, manufacturing processes, stability data, GMP Certificates, and country-specific regional information (e.g., US DMF Letters). Critical for ensuring product quality, safety, and regulatory acceptance under ICH CTD guidelines.
```

âœ… Aligned with FDA, EMA, PMDA expectations.

âœ… Covers both Drug Substance (3.2.S) and Drug Product (3.2.P).

âœ… Emphasizes importance of CMC compliance to avoid IND/NDA rejection.
