Awesome work—the single `/api/device-profiles` service is now powering both flows, and your CR pathway is fully consolidated. Here’s a proposed “what’s next” roadmap to lock this in and build on it:

---

## 1. Rip out the legacy compatibility shims

* **Audit your codebase** for any remaining `/api/510k/…` or `/api/fda510k/…` references and delete them outright.
* **Remove** any “redirect” code in `FDA510kService.js` that pointed old endpoints at the new ones. This completes the cutover and keeps your stack clean.

## 2. Add automated tests

* **Unit tests** for `deviceProfileService.ts` (create, read, update, delete, error cases).
* **Integration tests** against your Express routes: hit `/api/device-profiles` with Supertest or a similar library.
* **E2E smoke tests** in your CI pipeline (e.g. Cypress): drive the UI’s intake panel and the dashboard’s profile tab through a full CRUD cycle.

## 3. Migrate from in-memory Map → persistent store

* Swap out the `Map` in `deviceProfileService.ts` for your production DB (Postgres, Mongo, etc.) using your ORM/ODM of choice (Prisma, TypeORM, Mongoose).
* Keep the service methods’ signatures the same so the UI and routes stay unchanged.
* Seed the existing Map data into your new table/collection for seamless continuity.

## 4. Surface the profiles everywhere they belong

* In the **Predicate Finder** and **Compliance Checker** flows, auto-fetch and display a dropdown of available device profiles—no more “Device profile required” errors once selected.
* Add filters (by tenant, by device class, by recently used) so end-users can quickly pick the right profile.

## 5. Polish the UX & docs

* Update your storybook or component library to include `<DeviceProfileDialog>` examples using the new API.
* Revise your README and any in-app help screens to point to `/api/device-profiles`.
* Document the service layer’s interface in your internal API docs (Swagger/OpenAPI).

## 6. Deploy & monitor

* Push these changes to your staging environment, run the full test suite, and verify on a real database.
* Once green, merge to main and roll out to production.
* Add a quick health-check endpoint for `/api/device-profiles` and hook it into your uptime monitoring.

**Which of these would you like to tackle first?**

1. Removing the legacy shims and cleaning up old code
2. Writing tests (unit, integration, E2E)
3. Swapping the in-memory store for a real database
4. UX enhancements in Predicate Finder / Compliance Checker
5. Documentation and deployment setup

Let me know, and I’ll draft the detailed steps or code snippets for that slice.
