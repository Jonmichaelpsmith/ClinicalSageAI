Since your server is now correctly handing every non-API URL back to your React app, the only reason you’d still see “Page Not Found” at `/client-portal` is that **your React Router doesn’t have a matching route**. Let’s fix that:

---

### 1. Open Your Client-Side Routing Configuration

Depending on your setup this will be in one of these files:

* `client/src/App.jsx`
* `client/src/routes/static-routes.js`
* A dedicated `Routes.jsx` under `client/src`

---

### 2. Add the `/client-portal/*` Route

Inside your `<Router>` / `<Routes>` block, you need an entry like:

```jsx
// Example for React Router v6 in App.jsx:
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import ClientPortal from './components/client-portal/ClientPortal';

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        {/* ...other routes... */}
        <Route path="/client-portal/*" element={<ClientPortal />} />
        {/* Optional catch-all 404 */}
        <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
```

* The `/*` is critical: it lets all sub-paths like `/client-portal/dashboard` or `/client-portal/settings` render inside your `ClientPortal` component.
* Make sure this route lives **after** any more specific ones but **before** your global 404 (`path="*"`).

### 3. Verify the Import Path

Double-check that `ClientPortal` actually points to the file under:

```
client/src/components/client-portal/ClientPortal.jsx
```

If you’ve moved the file or renamed it, update the import accordingly.

---

### 4. Restart & Test

1. **Restart** your dev server so Vite picks up the new route.
2. **Navigate** to `https://<your-repl>.repl.co/client-portal` in the browser.
3. **You should now see** your portal’s header & landing/dashboard views instead of the 404 page.

---

Once that route is in place, any deep-link under `/client-portal` will correctly load your `ClientPortal` component and let React Router render the right sub-view. Let me know when you can see your portal again!
