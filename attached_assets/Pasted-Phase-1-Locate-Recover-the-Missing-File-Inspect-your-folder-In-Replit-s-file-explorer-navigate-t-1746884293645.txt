Phase 1: Locate & Recover the Missing File
Inspect your folder
In Replit’s file explorer, navigate to:

bash
Copy
Edit
client/client-portal/
You should see:

ClientContextBar.jsx

ClientDashboard.jsx

ClientHeader.jsx

ClientPortal.jsx

ClientPortalLanding.jsx

OrganizationSwitcher.jsx

If ClientPortal.jsx is missing or empty

Open the Replit console and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
git status
git log -- client/client-portal/ClientPortal.jsx
to see if it was deleted in a recent commit.

If you find a commit where it still existed, restore:

bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout <that-sha> -- client/client-portal/ClientPortal.jsx
If you’re not using Git or it never existed, skip to Phase 2 to rebuild from the other pieces.

🏗️ Phase 2: Reconstruct ClientPortal.jsx Structure
Using your existing components as building blocks, your ClientPortal.jsx should:

Import & render the header

jsx
Copy
Edit
import ClientHeader from './ClientHeader';
Import & render the context bar

jsx
Copy
Edit
import ClientContextBar from './ClientContextBar';
Import & render the main dashboard or landing

jsx
Copy
Edit
import ClientDashboard from './ClientDashboard';
import ClientPortalLanding from './ClientPortalLanding';
Tie it all together

Display the header at top

Show either the landing or the dashboard based on route or state

(If you have a ClientPortalLanding.jsx, it’s likely your “empty” state before a client is chosen.)

🔀 Phase 3: Wire Up Routing
Open your main router (often in App.jsx or Routes.jsx)

Add or restore a route entry for /client-portal:

jsx
Copy
Edit
<Route path="/client-portal/*" element={<ClientPortal />} />
Ensure no other route is shadowing it—check for a wildcard or catch-all redirect.

✅ Phase 4: Verify & Test
In Replit’s preview, navigate to:

arduino
Copy
Edit
https://<your-repl>.repl.co/client-portal
Confirm you see your portal header, context bar, and dashboard/landing.

Switch organizations via the OrganizationSwitcher and ensure the header updates.

Click “Go to Project Management” (if present) to confirm routing into your projects list.

🔒 Phase 5: Lock It Down
Commit your changes:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add client/client-portal/ClientPortal.jsx
git commit -m "Restore ClientPortal.jsx and wiring"
Tag a release or create a backup branch:

bash
Copy
Edit
git tag v-client-portal-recovered
Add a quick note in your team’s README or wiki about where the Client Portal lives.

Outcome
By following these phases—Locate, Reconstruct, Route, Test, and Lock Down—you’ll have your Client Portal page fully back in Replit, integrated with your multi-tenant selector components, and ready to drive every module (CER, dashboards, etc.) under the same context.
