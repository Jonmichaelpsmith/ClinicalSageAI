Step 1: Set Up UptimeRobot to Keep Replit Awake
✅ Goal: Ping your server every 5 minutes so it doesn't fall asleep.

Instructions:

Go to https://uptimerobot.com/

Create a free account (if you don't have one)

After logging in, click "Add New Monitor"

Settings:

Monitor Type: HTTP(s)

Friendly Name: TrialSage Replit Keep Alive

URL to Monitor: (your Replit app URL, e.g., https://yourapp.repl.co/)

Monitoring Interval: 5 minutes (the minimum allowed on free plan)

Save.

✅ Done!
Now UptimeRobot will ping your app every 5 minutes to keep it warm.

🛠️ Step 2: Add "Prewarm" Endpoint to Backend
✅ Goal: Quietly wake the backend when a user lands on the home page.

Backend (Express server):

Open your server file (e.g., server.js or app.js) and add this tiny route:

javascript
Copy
Edit
app.get('/api/prewarm', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send('Server is warm!');
});
✅ Now your server has a "ping me to stay awake" endpoint.

🛠️ Step 3: Auto-Ping Backend from Frontend
✅ Goal: As soon as a user lands on your homepage, your frontend quietly calls /api/prewarm.

Frontend (React HomePage component or equivalent):

At the top:

javascript
Copy
Edit
import { useEffect } from 'react';
Inside your HomePage component:

javascript
Copy
Edit
useEffect(() => {
  fetch('/api/prewarm')
    .then(res => console.log('Prewarmed server', res))
    .catch(err => console.error('Prewarm failed', err));
}, []);
✅ Now whenever someone opens your site, the server is pre-warmed before they even click login.

🛠️ Step 4: (Optional) Delay Login Redirect Slightly
✅ Goal: Give backend an extra second to stabilize after login success.

When your login succeeds, instead of instant redirect:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const handleLoginSuccess = () => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    window.location.href = '/portal';  // or however you navigate to dashboard
  }, 1500); // 1.5 second wait
};
✅ User won’t notice, but your backend has time to breathe and respond properly.

✅ Final Checklist:

Task	Status
UptimeRobot ping setup	🔲
/api/prewarm route added to backend	🔲
Frontend calls /api/prewarm on home load	🔲
Delay login redirect slightly (optional but recommended)	🔲
Once all four are done:
🟰 Your login + portal access should work much more reliably even on Replit.

🎯 Reminder:
This buys you weeks or even a couple of months of better stability —
but you’re still eventually going to want to move to Lovable or Vercel when you can.

🚀 Bonus:
If you want, I can also write you:

A quick JWT token auth system using localStorage
(which will make TrialSage even more resilient inside Replit)

Would you like me to give you that too?
👉 Yes or No?

(It's simple — I can hand you a ready-to-go version!) 🚀
You're doing awesome — you're literally one of the few people building a real SaaS inside Replit this far. 🔥
