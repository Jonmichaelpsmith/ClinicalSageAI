✅ Understood. Based on your uploaded documents—including the ICH E3 guideline, FDA guidance, European CTIS framework, and actual CSR/SAP examples—we are now ready to take LumenTrialGuide.AI to **the next level of semantic clinical intelligence**.

# 🧠 Enhanced CSR Intelligence Engine: Architecture & Plan  
**“Make every word in every CSR become structured intelligence.”**

---

## ✅ Goal:
Create a system that:
- Parses every regulatory-required data element from any CSR  
- Semantically maps it to a structured schema (like your `csr_mapping_template.json`)  
- Feeds into downstream modules: protocol planner, risk predictor, IND/SAP writer, investor decks

---

## 🔬 Regulatory & Semantic Basis (Cross-Document Validation):

From your documents, we synthesize that the following **key structures must be captured**:

### 🧱 Structural Backbone
| Section | Source |
|--------|--------|
| Title Page | ICH E3 §1, FDA Guidelines |
| Synopsis | ICH E3 §2, EMA CTIS |
| Ethics | ICH E3 §5 |
| Investigators | FDA 314.50(d)(5) |
| Objectives & Design | E3 §7–9 |
| Patients & Protocol Deviation | §10 |
| Efficacy & Safety | §11–12 |
| Statistical Methods | SAP & §9.7 |
| Regulatory Outcomes | CTIS submission criteria |

## 🧠 Deep Data Elements to Add to Your Model:

We will enhance your current `csr_mapping_template.json` with the following *semantic-level fields* extracted across all documents:

### 🔗 Clinical Design Semantics
```json
"semantic": {
  "design_rationale": "",
  "regulatory_classification": "",
  "study_type": "",
  "statistical_principles": [],
  "deviation_handling_method": "",
  "adjustment_for_covariates": "",
  "dropout_handling": "",
  "safety_monitoring_strategy": "",
  "subgroup_analysis_approach": ""
}
```

### 🔗 Pharmacologic Reasoning
```json
"pharmacology": {
  "moa_explained": "",
  "dose_selection_justification": "",
  "formulation_details": "",
  "bioavailability_finding": "",
  "pharmacokinetic_profiles": [],
  "pk_parameters": {}
}
```

### 🔗 Statistical Execution Semantics
```json
"stats_traceability": {
  "primary_model": "",
  "multiplicity_adjustment_method": "",
  "interim_analysis_details": "",
  "power_analysis_basis": "",
  "data_sources": [],
  "stratification_factors": []
}
```

---

## 🧠 Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Expanded JSON Mapping Template
- Expand `csr_mapping_template.json` to include all fields above

### Phase 2: NLP Extraction Pipeline
- Use:
  - 💬 Section headers (e.g. “9.7 Statistical Methods”)  
  - 🧠 Sentence embeddings (OpenAI, BioBERT)
  - 🔍 Ontology matchers (MeSH, SNOMED)
- Extract and normalize:  
  - Statistical models  
  - Endpoint justification  
  - SAE/AE patterns  
  - Ethics language  
  - Subgroup assumptions

### Phase 3: Semantic QA Layer
- Add explainability engine:
  - “How do we know this was a randomized controlled trial?”
  - “Why was a 12-week duration chosen?”

## ✅ Would You Like Me to Begin With:
- Building the updated mapping JSON (Phase 1)  
- Or wiring the NLP pipeline with OpenAI’s embedding + section locator?

We are ready to **turn every sentence in every CSR** into usable, explainable, auditable clinical intelligence. Let’s build.
