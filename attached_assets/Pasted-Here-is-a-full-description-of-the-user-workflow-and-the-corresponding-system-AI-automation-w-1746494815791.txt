## 👤 USER WORKFLOW vs 🤖 SYSTEM WORKFLOW

**Goal:** Generate a fully compliant, regulator-ready Clinical Evaluation Report (CER) with near-zero manual effort.

| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Clicks "Create New CER"                  | Initializes new report instance with unique ID               |
| Enters product name (e.g., “Stentra LX”) | Auto-fetches regulatory metadata: UNII, ATC class, GMDN, MoA |
| Selects device type & regulatory region  | Pre-loads section requirements based on EU MDR / FDA track   |
| Clicks “Begin”                           | Launches Section Generator and triggers FAERS ingestion      |

### 🧱 **Step 2: Core Section Generation**

| 👤 User Action                         | 🤖 System Behavior                                              |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Chooses section (e.g., Safety Profile) | Retrieves relevant data context (FAERS, comparators, clinical)  |
| Provides optional context or files     | Auto-parses content using NLP/OCR                               |
| Clicks “Generate”                      | GPT-4o writes full section with formatted content and citations |
| Reviews, edits, and confirms           | Stores section in report draft state                            |

### 🧬 **Step 3: Automated Data Intelligence**

| 👤 User Action      | 🤖 System Behavior                                             |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \[No input]         | System auto-fetches FAERS data via OpenFDA                     |
|                     | Maps product → UNII → FAERS → AE profiles                      |
|                     | Scores risk (weighted algorithm: death, hospitalization, etc.) |
|                     | Identifies comparators by ATC class                            |
|                     | Fetches comparator risk scores and writes summary language     |
| Opens “Preview” tab | CER preview shows all sections, FAERS tables, and risk charts  |

### 📚 **Step 4: Literature Review (Optional / Recommended)**

| 👤 User Action                        | 🤖 System Behavior                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Uploads PDFs or searches studies      | AI extracts methods, endpoints, sample size, and outcomes |
| Reviews summaries and selects studies | GPT-4o generates Literature Review section with citations |
| Adds to report                        | Automatically inserted into CER draft                     |

---

### ⚖️ **Step 5: Regulatory Scoring & Validation**

| 👤 User Action        | 🤖 System Behavior                                                    |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Clicks “Validate CER” | System checks compliance: EU MDR Annex XIV, ISO 14155, FDA flags      |
|                       | Identifies missing sections, low-quality data, non-compliant phrasing |
|                       | Auto-fixes minor gaps (e.g., missing rationale for equivalence)       |
| Views dashboard       | See pass/fail, score % by section, suggested remediations             |

### 📤 **Step 6: Export, Archive, Submit**

| 👤 User Action                       | 🤖 System Behavior                                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Clicks “Export PDF” or “Export Word” | Generates formatted file: TOC, FAERS tables, citations, appendices |
| Clicks “Save to Vault”               | Saves version with timestamp, author, and hash                     |
| (Optional) Sends to reviewer/client  | System generates share link (public or role-protected)             |

### 🧠 **Optional: AI Q\&A Review**

| 👤 User Action                            | 🤖 System Behavior                                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Clicks “Ask about this section”           | GPT explains AI’s reasoning, justifies risk assessments      |
| Types question (e.g., “Why is risk low?”) | Answers using real-world data, studies, and regulatory logic |
