✅ Thank you for the clear screenshot —  
✅ I see exactly what’s happening.

You are absolutely right:  
👉 **UnifiedTopNav is still not showing**.

You are stuck at Risk Heatmap tabs being isolated without a top-level Unified Navigation Bar.

---

# 🛠 **Real Reason Why UnifiedTopNav Isn't Appearing Yet**

| Problem | Explanation |
|:--------|:------------|
| UnifiedTopNav.jsx is built ✅ | But |
| RegulatoryIntelligenceHub.jsx hasn't mounted it properly | ❌ |
| Only RiskHeatmap/TimelineSimulator tabs are showing (inside page content), not global navigation | ❌ |
| Top `<UnifiedTopNav />` component is missing from render tree | ❌ |

✅ This is just a missing wiring step —  
✅ No major problem — very fast to fix.

---

# 📋 **Here’s Exactly How To Correct This Properly:**

---

# 🛠 1. Open `/client/src/pages/RegulatoryIntelligenceHub.jsx`

✅ Go to the very top of your `RegulatoryIntelligenceHub.jsx` file.

✅ Insert this import statement:

```javascript
import UnifiedTopNav from '../components/navigation/UnifiedTopNav';
```

✅ Right after your `useState` declaration (before you render anything), make sure you define:

```javascript
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('RiskHeatmap');
```

✅ Then **at the very top of your JSX tree** (before any other UI), insert:

```jsx
<UnifiedTopNav activeTab={activeTab} onTabChange={setActiveTab} />
```

✅ Example:

```jsx
export default function RegulatoryIntelligenceHub() {
  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('RiskHeatmap');

  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-gray-50">
      
      {/* Unified Top Navigation */}
      <UnifiedTopNav activeTab={activeTab} onTabChange={setActiveTab} />

      {/* Main Regulatory Intelligence Panels */}
      <div className="p-8 space-y-6">

        {/* Summary Metrics */}
        <AdvisorSummaryPanel />

        {/* Tabs Section */}
        {activeTab === 'RiskHeatmap' && (
          <AdvisorRiskHeatmapV2 />
        )}
        {activeTab === 'TimelineSimulator' && (
          <AdvisorTimelineSimulator />
        )}
        {activeTab === 'AskLumenAI' && (
          <AskLumenCoPilot />
        )}

      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

# 📈 **Result After Fix:**

✅ At the **very top** of the page,  
✅ You'll see:

- [ ← Back ] [ → Forward ] [ Return to Client Portal ]
- [ Risk Heatmap | Timeline Simulator | Ask Lumen AI ]

✅ **No matter which section you're viewing!**

✅ Real SaaS-grade unified navigation.

✅ No more isolated Risk Heatmap Tabs in weird places.

✅ Full sticky top nav on every screen.
