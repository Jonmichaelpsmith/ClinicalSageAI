Core Mission:
Deliver something no PowerBI, Qlik, or Tableau ever could:
“Exploration at the speed of thought. Prediction at the speed of need. Insight at the click of curiosity.”

🧠 TrialSage.AI Conversational Analytics Architecture
💡 EXPERIENCE DESIGN
🧬 “Associative Thinking” Engine
Explore AE vs. SAE vs. Endpoint vs. Phase vs. Indication

Click or speak any combination

AI recontextualizes all charts and insights in real-time

User Says	System Does
“What dropout rate do we expect for oral NASH trials with >12 weeks?”	Instantly filters cohort, visualizes dropout dist
“Compare our Phase 2 design to the top 10 most successful trials in similar TAs”	Predictive overlay + CSR citations
“Why is our Arm B underperforming?”	AI interprets AE clusters, screen fail %, effect size delta
🧩 KEY LAYERS OF THE SYSTEM
1. 🔁 Conversational Intelligence Pipeline
Natural language → GPT-4 Turbo (with memory) → tool calls:

generateFilterContext()

summarizeCohort()

predictRisk()

generateGraphData()

2. 🧠 Augmented Analytics Engine
Automated insight generation at every step

Auto flagging:

“Endpoint mismatch”

“Screen fail too high”

“AE signal vs. control shows risk”

3. 📊 Visual Object Layer
Embedded DrillDown UI:

Study cards

Protocol timelines

AE cloud

Dropout + endpoint graphs

Fully reactive: clicking a bar updates NLP assistant memory

4. ⚡ Live Data + Inference Pipeline
CSRs vector-embedded + normalized

Prediction engine built on XGBoost or LLM + code interpreter

Risk scoring + outcome forecasting in milliseconds

✅ AI Use Cases to Deliver (Beyond Dashboards)
Feature	Powered By	Purpose
Conversational Filters	GPT-4 + vector context	No query syntax needed
Protocol Benchmarking	GPT-4 + evidence links	Compare to most successful CSRs
Prediction Simulation	Code interpreter + ML	“Run this protocol 1000x—what happens?”
AutoInsight Alerts	AI Agent Memory	Flag issues dynamically
Visual Explorer Mode	Object-click → prompt regen	Create new questions by clicking through plots
📦 What We Build First
New Replit Component: /controllers/analytics.py
With routes:

POST /api/analytics/query

POST /api/analytics/predict

GET /api/analytics/context

POST /api/analytics/visualize

GET /api/analytics/csr-drill/{study_id}

New Service: /services/analytics_engine.py
Handles prompt → OpenAI → structured result

Returns:

Natural language answer

Visual config (plot type, axes, payload)

Drilldown link if applicable

Frontend: 🧠 Conversational Analytics UI
Search bar (“ask anything”)

Smart object map (AE, dropout, endpoint, CSR clusters)

Highlighted insights: “You may want to explore X”

🚀 This Becomes Our Killer App
This isn’t just TrialSage’s best feature—it’s biotech’s first real-time study design insight engine.

Shall I now:

Begin building /controllers/analytics.py?

Define the first conversational route: POST /api/analytics/query?

Begin scaffolding the visual + predictive output structure?

This becomes the moment TrialSage stops chasing competitors—and starts replacing them.
