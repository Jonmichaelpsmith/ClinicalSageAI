Verify the Symptom
Open your browser’s DevTools → Network tab

Reload the CERV2 page and look for any requests for .js files that return HTML (you’ll see an HTML snippet in the Preview)

Note the URL of the failing asset(s) and the Status Code (often 200 OK, but content is HTML rather than JS)

2. Typical Root Causes
Catch-All Route Order: A server fallback (e.g. app.get('*', …)) is catching JS asset requests and returning index.html.

Static Middleware Misconfiguration: Your static file handler isn’t mounted (or is mounted after your catch-all), so JS files never get served from disk.

Incorrect MIME Type Headers: The server is sending HTML responses with Content-Type: text/html even for .js URLs.

3. Step-By-Step Fixes
3.1. Reorder Express Static & Fallback
In your server/index.ts (or wherever you configure Express):

js
Copy
Edit
import path from 'path';
import express from 'express';

const app = express();

// 1) Serve your API routes first:
app.use('/api', apiRouter);

// 2) Serve built frontend assets **before** any catch-all:
const clientDist = path.join(__dirname, '../client/dist');
app.use(express.static(clientDist, {
  // ensure index.html is only served for unmatched routes
  extensions: ['js','css','png','svg','html']
}));

// 3) Fallback: only catch *non-API*, non-asset requests
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  // If the request looks like a static asset (has extension), let static middleware handle it
  if (/\.(js|css|png|svg|ico|map)$/i.test(req.path)) {
    return res.status(404).end();
  }
  // Otherwise, serve the index.html for SPA routing
  res.sendFile(path.join(clientDist, 'index.html'));
});

app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server listening on ${PORT}`));
Why this works:

Static middleware (express.static) will try to match *.js or other asset files in your /dist folder first, and serve them with the correct Content-Type: application/javascript.

The catch-all only responds when no file is found, and only for non-asset routes, preventing HTML from masquerading as JS.

3.2. Confirm MIME Types
Express’s static will automatically set the correct MIME based on file extension. If you ever have to serve a JS file manually, explicitly set the header:

js
Copy
Edit
res.type('application/javascript').sendFile(pathToJsFile);
4. Vite Configuration (Dev + Prod)
In vite.config.ts, ensure your base and build.rollupOptions are correct so that asset paths resolve properly:

ts
Copy
Edit
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  root: path.resolve(__dirname, 'client'),
  base: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
    ? '/static/'          // if you're serving from /static/ on your server
    : '/',
  build: {
    outDir: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'), // relative to root
    emptyOutDir: true,
    rollupOptions: {
      input: {
        main: path.resolve(__dirname, 'client/index.html')
      }
    }
  },
  server: {
    host: '0.0.0.0',
    port: 3000,
    hmr: { protocol: 'ws', host: 'localhost' }
  }
});
base ensures <script src="…"> tags point to the right public URL prefix in production.

outDir tells Vite where to emit your build so that Express’s static middleware can find it.

5. Verify & Test
Rebuild the client:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd client
npm run build
Restart your server and open the CER Builder page.

In DevTools → Network, confirm each .js request returns the JS bundle (Content-Type: application/javascript) and not HTML.

Verify that the console errors disappear and that the tabs/components now load correctly.

6. Add Safeguards
Logging Middleware: In production, consider logging any requests for *.js that return HTML so you can catch regressions.

Automated Smoke Test: Write a lightweight integration test (e.g. using Playwright or Cypress) that loads /cer and asserts that no network request for .js returns HTML.

Documentation: Add a note in your README about the required ordering of static middleware and catch-all routes so future maintainers avoid the same pitfall.

By ensuring that your Express (or other backend) serves JS assets before falling back to HTML—and by verifying your Vite base path—your “Unexpected token ‘<’” errors will vanish, restoring full client-side functionality to the CERV2 module.
