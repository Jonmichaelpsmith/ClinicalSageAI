Below is a targeted enhancement spec for the CER Generator™ module—elevating it from a simple form to a full-blown document management, AI-coauthoring, and historical reporting hub that sits seamlessly inside TrialSage™. I’ve broken it down into three tiers: **Immediate**, **Mid-Term**, and **Visionary**, along with next-step tasks.

---

## 🔥 Immediate Enhancements (1–2 sprints)

1. **“Generate Sample CER” One-Click**  
   - **UI:** Add a primary button “Generate Full CER Report” above the form.  
   - **API:**  
     - `POST /api/cer/generate-full` → kicks off AI draft of every CER section in sequence.  
   - **UX:** Show a progress bar and then render a downloadable PDF + “Open in Editor” link.

2. **Past Reports Library Panel**  
   - **UI:**  
     - Sidebar (or tab) called “My CER Reports” with folder-style grouping by project & date.  
     - Thumbnail + title + status (Draft/Final).  
   - **Data:**  
     - `GET /api/vault/cer-reports?projectId=` → returns list of metadata.  
   - **Actions:**  
     - Click to open in the CoAuthor canvas; “Download PDF”; “Clone to new draft.”

3. **Embedded TrialSage Vault Viewer**  
   - **UI:** Every module screen (including CER) has a collapsible “Documents” drawer at bottom/right.  
   - **Features:** Drag & drop upload; filter by type (CER, Stability, CSR); quick-link to open in appropriate module.

## 🚀 Mid-Term Enhancements (3–5 sprints)

4. **Template Selector & Import**  
   - **UI:** “Select Template” dropdown (Fast IND CER, Full NDA CER, EMA CESP) pre-loads section scaffolds.  
   - **Data:** Store template JSON in `/server/templates/cer/{template}.json`.  
   - **UX:** Users can “Import Template” at any time—sections appear in Section Editor.

5. **Active-Learning Loop**  
   - **UI:** Inline thumbs-up/thumbs-down on each AI-generated section.  
   - **Data:**  
     - `POST /api/cer/feedback` with `{ sectionId, approval: boolean, comments }`.  
   - **Model:** Aggregate feedback to fine-tune prompt weights or, in future, custom embeddings per client.

6. **Client-Side eCTD Schema Validation**  
   - **UI:** “Validate eCTD Package” button that runs the FDA’s eCTD validation engine in-browser (WebAssembly).  
   - **UX:** Warnings and errors pop up inline in the Report Library before “Download” or “Submit.”

7. **One-Click Submission Hooks**  
   - **UI:** After validation passes, show “Submit to FDA ESG” / “Submit to EMA CESP.”  
   - **API:**  
     - `POST /api/cer/submit/esg` and `/api/cer/submit/cesp` → handle authentication, upload.

## 🌟 Visionary Enhancements (6+ sprints)

8. **Canvas Co-Authoring Workbench**  
   - A free-form “whiteboard” where writers can drag & drop sections (nodes), re-arrange hierarchy, link references (PubMed/FDA) with live AI suggestions.

9. **Automated Regulatory Intelligence Feeds**  
   - Continuously pull updates from FDA’s safety databases, i.e. recalls or new guidances, surface alerts in your CER drafts.

10. **Collaborative Review + Audit Trail**  
    - Real-time multi-user editing, comments, version compare, digital sign-off, and audit logs (21 CFR Part 11 compliance).

11. **Deep Data-Driven Analytics**  
    - Dashboard showing average time to generate reports, approval rates, top-flagged sections, and benchmarked against industry averages.

### Next-Step Tasks

1. **Wireframe & UX Review**  
   - Sketch the “My CER Reports” library, “Generate Full CER” flow, and “Documents drawer” on each module.

2. **API Contract Definitions**  
   - Draft OpenAPI schema for the new CER endpoints (`/generate-full`, `/reports`, `/feedback`, `/submit`).

3. **Back-end Scaffolding**  
   - Implement stub routes and services in `server/routes/cer.js` and `server/services/cerService.js`.

4. **Front-end Components**  
   - Build `CerReportsPanel.jsx`, `CerGenerateButton.jsx`, and integrate into `CER2Page.jsx`; hook into Vault via existing `VaultDocumentsDrawer` component.

5. **Client-Side eCTD Validator Integration**  
   - Evaluate FDA eCTD validation WebAssembly package (e.g., [OpenECDX on npm](https://npmjs.com/package/opene cdx)) and integrate into the build pipeline.

6. **QA & Security Review**  
   - Ensure all document uploads and AI calls are encrypted end-to-end, with zero data retention by OpenAI (per your zero-retention policy).

Once these core pieces are in place, we’ll iterate on Active-Learning Loop, template management, and one-click submission. This roadmap will put TrialSage™ clearly ahead of the field—you’ll have an AI-coauthoring CER Generator, full report history, live schema validation, and direct submission hooks all wrapped in a polished, enterprise-grade UX.
