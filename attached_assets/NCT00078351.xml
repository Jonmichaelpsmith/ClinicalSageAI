  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>This study will examine the effectiveness of injected hylan (Synvisc) for treating pain&#xd;
associated with osteoarthritis of the temporomandibular joint (jaw joint) and improving&#xd;
function of the joint. Hylan is a synthetic product very similar to a component of normal&#xd;
healthy joint fluid (synovial fluid), which is present in much lower quantities and is&#xd;
abnormal in osteoarthritis. Hylan injections have been beneficial in treating&#xd;
osteoarthritis of the knee.&#xd;
&#xd;
Patients with temporomandibular (TMJ) joint pain of at least 3 months duration who have&#xd;
mouth opening limitation and moderate to severe joint pain made worse by joint movement&#xd;
may be eligible for this study. Patients must not have any TMJ growth disturbances and&#xd;
must not have had any TMJ surgery for 6 months before entering the study. Candidates are&#xd;
screened with questionnaires, a medical history, and a physical examination of the TMJs,&#xd;
including x-rays and magnetic resonance imaging.&#xd;
&#xd;
Participants are randomly assigned to receive three injections, each a week apart, of&#xd;
either Synvisc or placebo (a salt-water solution) into the affected joint. Before the&#xd;
first injection, a sample of synovial fluid is collected from the joint by needle&#xd;
aspiration for laboratory analysis. Patients return for follow-up visits 3, 6, and 12&#xd;
months after the last treatment for a clinical examination of the jaw joint and review of&#xd;
jaw joint symptoms. A second aspiration is requested at the 3-month visit, but is not&#xd;
mandatory. All injections and aspirations are done after anesthetizing the overlying skin&#xd;
and joint capsule to minimize pain or discomfort. Participants record their daily use of&#xd;
pain relief medication throughout the study.</textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>The proposed clinical trial will evaluate the effects of high molecular weight hylan&#xd;
(Synvisc) injection in comparison with control treatment (saline injection) for&#xd;
osteoarthritis (OA) affecting the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Patients with TMJ OA of&#xd;
at least three-month duration and who have not responded to conservative treatments will&#xd;
be included. Patients will be randomly assigned to either high molecular hylan injection&#xd;
or control. At baseline and follow up visits, clinical outcome measures will be assessed&#xd;
such as pain and range of motion. Positive findings in clinical outcome measures will&#xd;
provide evidence for the clinical utility of Synvisc in patients with painful TMJ OA. In&#xd;
addition to clinical outcome measures, a sample of synovial fluid from the affected joint&#xd;
will be obtained at the baseline visit and at 12 week follow up, and levels of tumor&#xd;
necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and Tissue inhibitor of&#xd;
metalloproteinase (TIMP) will be analyzed. By studying the synovial fluid levels of TNF&#xd;
alpha, MMP and TIMP, we will assess the effects of viscosupplementation with Synvisc on&#xd;
the local inflammatory process and proteolytic activity in TMJ OA in comparison with&#xd;
control treatment. Positive findings in clinical symptoms and synovial fluid analysis&#xd;
will also provide implications of clinical utility of Synvisc in patients with painful&#xd;
TMJ OA. Furthermore, this analysis of synovial fluid may identify biomarkers associated&#xd;
with OA affecting the TMJ.</textblock>

      <textblock>INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xd;
&#xd;
We will recruit patients with TMJ OA defined by the Research Diagnostic Criteria.&#xd;
Patients are required to have chronic preauricular pain for more than 3 months, even&#xd;
though they have received some palliative treatment (NSAIDs and/or stabilization splint&#xd;
therapy). Radiological imaging is indicated in addition to clinical evaluation to confirm&#xd;
the diagnosis of TMJ OA. Radiographic evidence of OA includes flattening of condyle,&#xd;
increased opacity of cortical bone of condyle, or osteophyte formation. Prior to being&#xd;
admitted to the study, patients will be screened with standard temporomandibular joint&#xd;
radiological imaging, including panoramic, tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging&#xd;
(MRI) studies. Radiological imaging will not be repeated at the end of the study unless&#xd;
medically indicated. The patients are required to have mouth opening limitation (less&#xd;
than normal) and moderate to severe joint pain aggravated by jaw movement. Patients who&#xd;
have undergone any TMJ surgery within the preceding 6 months will be excluded, as well as&#xd;
those who have taken analgesic, anti-inflammatory, steroids or narcotic medications&#xd;
during the last 15 days. Further exclusion criteria will be patients who have any TMJ&#xd;
growth disturbances. Patients with red, hot, swollen, tender TMJ, or those with history&#xd;
consist of infectious arthritis, crystal induced arthropathies, and musculoskeletal&#xd;
disorders will also be excluded. Patients with rheumatic disease will also be excluded,&#xd;
this will be determined by baseline blood tests (CBC, chem. 7, ESR, Rheumatoid factor).&#xd;
&#xd;
Patients will be screened for any positive history of liver or kidney dysfunctions. Any&#xd;
patients with a medical history of diabetes, congestive heart failure, any chronic&#xd;
infections will also be excluded. Subjects that have primary psychiatric disease or score&#xd;
above average in comparison with normative scores on Symptom Checklist (SCL-90R) will not&#xd;
be able to participate. Pregnant women will not be included in the study, this will be&#xd;
determined by a pregnancy test, and subjects will be required to use 2 forms of&#xd;
contraception for the first 3 weeks of the study (to cover the synvisc injections). It is&#xd;
a standard practice in chronic pain study not to include patients who are involved in&#xd;
litigation. Patients with sepsis or with known hypersensitivity to hyaluronan and any of&#xd;
its components will be excluded to the study.</textblock>
