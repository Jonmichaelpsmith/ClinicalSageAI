want to enhance the Fail Map application for Trialsage.ai, a global intelligence system for Clinical Study Reports (CSRs), as it currently feels too basic. The previous version I provided was a Flask app for Replit with a simulated dataset of 3,000 CSRs, using SpaCy for NLP, SentenceTransformer for similarity matching, Scikit-learn for prediction, SQLite for storage, Plotly for visualizations, and Tailwind CSS for the frontend. You’re looking for a more sophisticated, production-grade solution with advanced features, better scalability, and a more robust architecture.

Memories Integration
From our past conversations, I recall your focus on clinical trial analytics and productivity tools. For instance, on March 21, 2025, you discussed a step-by-step workflow for a Clinical Trial Management solution, emphasizing data flow, users, and milestones like First Patient First Visit (FPFV). Additionally, on March 26, 2025, you explored how the Oomnia platform handles audio data in clinical studies, showing your interest in advanced data processing. These insights suggest you’d value a system with deeper analytics, real-time processing, and scalability for global CSR intelligence.

Enhanced Approach for Trialsage.ai
Let’s redesign the Fail Map application as a more advanced, scalable web app using a modern tech stack suitable for a global intelligence system. Here’s the upgraded plan:

Backend: Use FastAPI (faster and more scalable than Flask) with PostgreSQL for robust data storage. Implement asynchronous processing for better performance with large datasets.
NLP and Embeddings: Use a more advanced model, all-distilroberta-v1, for better embeddings, and integrate SpaCy with custom pipelines for entity extraction (e.g., therapeutic area, endpoints).
Machine Learning: Replace RandomForest with XGBoost for improved prediction accuracy, and add hyperparameter tuning with Optuna.
Data Storage: Use PostgreSQL with a vector extension (pgvector) to store and query embeddings efficiently for similarity matching.
Frontend: Build a React app with TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS, and use Recharts for interactive visualizations (more modern than Plotly for React integration).
Scalability: Containerize the app with Docker for easy deployment on Replit or cloud platforms like AWS.
Features:
Real-time CSR analysis with live updates.
Advanced filtering and sorting for similar studies.
Exportable PDF reports using pdfkit.
User authentication with JWT for secure access.
Caching with Redis to improve performance for frequent queries.
Since this is a significant upgrade but builds on the previous Fail Map concept, I’ll reuse the same artifact ID with an updated version.

Code Structure for Replit
To keep this manageable in Replit, I’ll provide a single index.html file with an embedded React app (using JSX and Tailwind CSS via CDNs) that communicates with the FastAPI backend. However, for a production-grade system, I’d recommend splitting this into separate frontend and backend services (e.g., using Vite for React and a separate FastAPI server). For now, I’ll focus on the frontend React app, and I can provide the backend code in a follow-up if needed.

This file sets up a React app with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Recharts for visualizations. It includes user authentication, a form for CSR input, and advanced visualizations with filtering capabilities.
