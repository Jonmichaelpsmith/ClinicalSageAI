Let's now move to the testing and debugging phase to ensure everything works as expected on Replit.

## 5. Testing & Debugging on Replit

### A. Run Your Project

1. **Start the Backend Server:**  
   With your `.replit` file configured, click "Run" in Replit. The command:
   ```ini
   uvicorn main:app --host=0.0.0.0 --port=3000 --reload
   ```
   will start your FastAPI server on port 3000. You should see logs indicating that the server is up and running.

2. **Run Your Frontend (if separate):**  
   If you're using a Create React App setup or similar, ensure your frontend is started. If it's bundled within the same project, check that the React components load correctly.

### B. Verify the API Endpoint

1. **Direct Browser Test:**  
   Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   https://<your-replit-project-url>/api/cer/1234567890
   ```
   Replace `1234567890` with a sample NDC code. You should see a JSON response (or an error if the sample NDC code doesn't yield data).

2. **Using CURL or Postman:**  
   You can also test the endpoint using CURL:
   ```bash
   curl https://<your-replit-project-url>/api/cer/1234567890
   ```
   This helps confirm that the API is returning the expected data.

### C. Verify the Frontend Integration

1. **Load the CER Generator Component:**  
   In your browser, load the page containing the CERGenerator component. You should see an input field for the NDC code, a button to generate the CER, and an area to display the report.

2. **Test the Full Flow:**  
   - Enter a valid NDC code.
   - Click **"Generate CER"**.
   - Observe the button state (e.g., it displays "Generating..." while processing) and then wait for the CER report to display.
   - Check the Replit console for any errors if nothing appears or if there are network issues.

### D. Debugging Tips

- **Check Replit Logs:**  
  Any errors from your FastAPI backend or issues with the OpenAI API will appear in the Replit console logs. These logs are essential for troubleshooting.

- **Validate Environment Variables:**  
  Ensure that `OPENAI_API_KEY` is correctly set in Replit Secrets. A misconfiguration here will prevent the narrative generation.

- **Review CORS and Proxy Settings:**  
  If your frontend isn't receiving responses from the backend, double-check your proxy settings in `package.json` or configure CORS on FastAPI using:
  ```python
  from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

  app.add_middleware(
      CORSMiddleware,
      allow_origins=["*"],
      allow_credentials=True,
      allow_methods=["*"],
      allow_headers=["*"],
  )
  ```

### Final Check

With the backend, frontend, and environment properly configured, your CER integration should now be functional on Replit. Test thoroughly with different NDC codes to ensure robustness.
