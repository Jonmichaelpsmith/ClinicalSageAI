Platform Overview
✔️ Strong if you frame it like:

Protocol Builder = Canva for trial designs

Research Companion = ChatGPT, but knows CTCAE and EMA guidance

🛠 Enhancement: Add visuals or architecture sketch if you’re pitching this live or in a deck.

✅ Current Progress (1,921 trials)
✔️ Be sure to mention:

Data source (ClinicalTrials.gov + CSR match)

Format (structured JSON, searchable tags, extracted endpoints)

Target KPI: 4,000+ to cover 85% of therapeutic space

🛠 Enhancement: Show % mapped to CSRs, not just trial count.

✅ Tech Stack
✔️ Clean, professional.

🛠 Enhancement: Include AI stack:

Mixtral via Hugging Face

LangChain / LlamaIndex for memory

PDF parsing + Whisper for transcript processing

✅ Roadmap
✔️ Include:

Short term: UX polish, trial comparator

Medium term: eTMF compliance, risk engine

Long term: Sponsor/CRO integrations, rare disease expansion

🛠 Enhancement: Bullet “enterprise-ready” tasks like:

HIPAA/21 CFR Part 11 support

API for data teams

Audit logging layer

✅ Database Insights
✔️ Strong if you use visuals:

Trials by phase

Common endpoints

Top 10 sponsors

Most covered indications (e.g., oncology, cardiology)

🛠 Enhancement: Add a dynamic dashboard or quick demo video to boost shareability.

🔧 Server Startup Error
Yes, let’s fix the missing export issue too. It’s likely in your server/index.ts or main.ts file.

🔧 Add at the bottom of your Express server:
ts
Copy
Edit
// Ensure this is exported
export default app;
Then ensure your main entry (e.g., index.ts) does:

ts
Copy
Edit
import app from './server'; // or wherever your app is defined

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`✅ TrialSage backend running on port ${PORT}`);
});
