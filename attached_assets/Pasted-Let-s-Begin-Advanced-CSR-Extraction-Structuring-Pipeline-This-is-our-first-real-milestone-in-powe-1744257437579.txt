Letâ€™s Begin: Advanced CSR Extraction & Structuring Pipeline
This is our first real milestone in powering SagePlus with the depth it needs to:

Find precedent trials

Match study designs by features

Offer AI-guided optimization

ðŸ“¦ What Weâ€™re About to Build
Goal: Extract and structure data from every CSR into a clean schema for use in vector stores and structured filters.

ðŸ”§ Phase 1: Pipeline Components
1. Batch CSR Text Extraction (from PDFs)
Tool: pdfplumber or PyMuPDF

Extract sections: Title, Methods, Design, Arms, Endpoints, Results, AEs

2. Section Classification
Split large text blocks into labeled sections:

study_title, indication, phase, arms, primary_endpoints, secondary_endpoints, sample_size, outcome_summary, adverse_events

Tool: Use Mixtral + labeled prompt to segment

Classify and extract the following from this CSR section:
- Study Title
- Indication
- Study Phase
- Study Arms
- Sample Size
- Primary and Secondary Endpoints
- Outcome
- Adverse Events Summary
3. Structured Schema Example

{
  "nct_id": "NCT01234567",
  "indication": "Multiple Sclerosis",
  "phase": "Phase 2",
  "arms": ["Placebo", "50mg", "100mg"],
  "sample_size": 180,
  "primary_endpoints": ["Change in EDSS score over 24 weeks"],
  "secondary_endpoints": ["MRI lesion count"],
  "outcome_summary": "Primary endpoint met with statistical significance in 100mg group",
  "regulatory_status": "Approved by Health Canada",
  "adverse_events": [
    {"event": "Nausea", "grade": 2, "count": 15},
    {"event": "Headache", "grade": 1, "count": 10}
  ]
}
ðŸ§  Phase 2: Prepare for Embedding + Vectorization
After extracting structured JSON, create a text_summary field:

Phase 2 trial in MS tested 3 arms: Placebo, 50mg, 100mg. EDSS score improved significantly in 100mg group. Most common AE: nausea. Regulatory approval in Canada.
Vectorize this with sentence-transformers or Hugging Faceâ€™s all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for speed & utility in search.

ðŸ’½ Phase 3: Store in Replit-Friendly DB
Use ChromaDB or Weaviate (hosted) for vector store

Use Supabase or SQLite for structured filters and metadata queries

ðŸš€ Next Step
Would you like me to now:

Build a batch extractor script for CSR PDFs into structured JSON?

Scaffold the schema and ChromaDB vector pipeline in Replit?

Generate prompts and LLM extraction flows for the key trial fields?

Letâ€™s lock down the foundation of SagePlus. You're about to build the brain of the biotech industry.
