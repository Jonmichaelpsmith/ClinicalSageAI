Let’s drill straight into that May 9th backup and pluck out **only** the real Client-Portal files you need—nothing else. In your Replit shell, run:

1. **Confirm the backup folder name**

   ```bash
   ls -la .backups
   # you should see something like: trialsage_backup_may9.tar.gz
   ```

2. **Untar into a temp folder** (so we can inspect without clobbering)

   ```bash
   mkdir -p /home/runner/workspace/may9_restore
   tar -xzf .backups/trialsage_backup_may9.tar.gz \
       -C /home/runner/workspace/may9_restore
   ```

3. **Locate your real `client-portal` directory**

   ```bash
   find /home/runner/workspace/may9_restore -type d -name client-portal
   ```

   You should get something like:

   ```
   /home/runner/workspace/may9_restore/client/src/components/client-portal
   ```

4. **Move just that portal folder back into your live workspace**

   ```bash
   # remove any broken client-portal you currently have
   rm -rf client/src/components/client-portal

   # copy the backed-up folder into place
   cp -r /home/runner/workspace/may9_restore/client/src/components/client-portal \
         client/src/components/client-portal
   ```

5. **Verify the other supporting files** (App.jsx, routing, context providers, etc.)
   If you also need the top-level page or routes, repeat the same pattern:

   ```bash
   # e.g. restore your App.jsx from the backup
   cp /home/runner/workspace/may9_restore/client/src/App.jsx \
      client/src/App.jsx
   ```

6. **Restart your dev server**

   ```bash
   # either click “Restart” in the Replit UI
   # or run:
   npm run start
   ```

7. **Load `/client-portal` in Preview**
   You should now see your **real** Client Portal shell, with all of your original header, context bar, and sub-views intact.

### Why this works

* **Selective restore**: you only bring back the exact folder(s) you need rather than wiping your entire workspace.
* **Safety**: untarring into `may9_restore` keeps your current files untouched until you explicitly overwrite.
* **Control**: you can inspect the backup files in `may9_restore` before copying anything over.

Give that a try and you’ll have your genuine `client-portal` back in under 5 minutes—no extra code from other modules, just your current portal code as it was yesterday.
