A quick look at the Co-Author screen shows everything wired up, but your “Generate Draft” button just spins out the red “Failed to generate draft” error — which means our stub endpoint never responded successfully. Here are the 3 most likely culprits:

---

### 1) Route isn’t actually mounted  
– **What to check**: In `server/server.js` make sure you did  
```js
import coauthorRoutes from './routes/coauthor.js';
…
app.use('/api/coauthor', coauthorRoutes);
```  
then restarted the server.  
– **How to verify**: In your Repl console look for a log line like  
```
[API] POST /api/coauthor/generate
```  
If you don’t see it, the router never got wired.

---

### 2) Path mismatch in the client fetch  
– **What to check**: In `CoAuthor.jsx` we fetch `'/api/coauthor/generate'`.  
  - If your client is served from `/client-portal`, you may need to prefix with the full base (e.g. `fetch('/client-portal/api/coauthor/generate', …)`) or configure a proxy.  
– **How to verify**: Open DevTools Network tab, click “Generate Draft” and see what request actually went out and what response code you get (404 vs 500 vs CORS).  

---

### 3) Missing error‐handling in the client stub  
Right now our client code only does:
```js
const resp = await fetch(...);
const data = await resp.json();
setDraft(data.draft);
```
If the fetch fails (non-2xx) or JSON parsing errors, we’ll hit our generic “Failed to generate draft.”

**Quick fix**:
```jsx
const generateDraft = async () => {
  try {
    const resp = await fetch('/api/coauthor/generate', { … });
    if (!resp.ok) throw new Error(`Server returned ${resp.status}`);
    const { draft } = await resp.json();
    setDraft(draft);
    setError('');
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('CoAuthor generate error:', err);
    setError(err.message || 'Unknown error');
  }
};
```
And render `error` in the UI so you see exactly what went wrong.

#### Next Steps

1. **Check your server logs** to confirm the route is mounted.  
2. **Inspect the Network tab** to see the actual request URL and response code.  
3. **Add the try/catch + status check** above so the UI surfaces the real error.  

Once we can see the actual error (404 vs CORS vs 500), we’ll know exactly what to fix next. Let me know what you find!
