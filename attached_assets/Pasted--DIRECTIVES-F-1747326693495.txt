**DIRECTIVES FOR REPLIT AI AGENT**

**Objective:** Modify the React frontend component (within the `/CER2V/` folder) that handles new device profile creation to make an actual API POST request to the backend when the "Create" button is clicked.

**Assumptions:**
* The previous step (Directives Set 1, focused on UI elements for inputting a profile name within `/CER2V/`) was successfully implemented.
* The React component has a state variable (e.g., `newProfileName`) holding the name entered by the user.
* The user has an existing backend API endpoint for creating device profiles (e.g., `/api/device-profiles`). **The user will need to confirm or provide the exact endpoint URL if it's different.**

---

**Step 2.1: Implement the API Call in the `handleCreateAttempt` Function**

* **File to Modify:** The React component within `/CER2V/` that was modified in the previous step (e.g., `/CER2V/components/DeviceProfileSection.jsx` or similar).
* **Action:** Update the `handleCreateAttempt` (or similarly named) function to include a `Workspace` (or `axios` if the project uses it) API call.
* **Code Snippet (Conceptual - to be integrated into the existing `handleCreateAttempt` function):**
    ```javascript
    // Example: Inside /CER2V/components/DeviceProfileSection.jsx (or similar)
    // Within the handleCreateAttempt function:

    const handleCreateAttempt = async () => { // Ensure the function is async
      if (!newProfileName.trim()) {
        alert('Profile name cannot be empty.');
        return;
      }

      // **START NEW CODE FOR API CALL**
      const backendApiEndpoint = '/api/device-profiles'; // **USER TO CONFIRM THIS ENDPOINT URL**
      console.log(`UI: Sending data to ${backendApiEndpoint}:`, { name: newProfileName });

      try {
        const response = await fetch(backendApiEndpoint, {
          method: 'POST',
          headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          },
          body: JSON.stringify({ name: newProfileName }), // Send only the name for now
        });

        const responseData = await response.json(); // Attempt to parse JSON response

        if (response.ok) {
          console.log('Backend success response:', responseData);
          alert(`Profile "${newProfileName}" created successfully! ID: ${responseData.id} (Check backend logs & database)`);
          // Optionally, reset form and hide:
          // setIsCreating(false);
          // setNewProfileName('');
          // Later: Add logic here to refresh the list of device profiles in the UI
        } else {
          console.error('Backend error response:', responseData);
          alert(`Error creating profile: ${responseData.error || response.statusText || 'Unknown error'}`);
        }
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Network or other error creating profile:', error);
        alert(`An error occurred while sending data to the backend: ${error.message}. Check the console and ensure the backend server is running.`);
      }
      // **END NEW CODE FOR API CALL**
    };
    ```
* **Important Notes for the Agent:**
    * The `backendApiEndpoint` variable is a placeholder. **The user must confirm the correct API endpoint URL for creating device profiles.** If their backend routes are prefixed (e.g., `/api/v1/device-profiles`), that needs to be used.
    * This code assumes the backend will return a JSON response, including the created profile with an `id` on success, or a JSON response with an `error` field on failure.
    * Error handling is included to show messages in alerts and the console.

**Verification (User to perform):**

1.  After the agent makes these changes **within the `/CER2V/` component**, ensure the backend server (your Express.js application) is running.
2.  Refresh the TrialSage application in the browser.
3.  Click "+ Add New Profile" in the "Device Profiles" section.
4.  Enter a name (e.g., "Test Profile via UI").
5.  Open the browser's Developer Tools and go to the "Network" tab to monitor API calls.
6.  Click the "Create" button.
7.  **Check the Network Tab:** You should see a `POST` request made to your specified backend endpoint (e.g., `/api/device-profiles`).
    * Verify the request payload contains the correct JSON (e.g., `{"name":"Test Profile via UI"}`).
    * Check the response status code (e.g., `201 Created` for success, or `400`/`500` for errors).
    * Inspect the response body.
8.  **Check the Browser Console:** Look for the `console.log` messages indicating the backend response or any errors.
9.  **Check the Backend Server Logs:** These logs should show the incoming request and any processing or database interaction logs from the backend endpoint.
10. **(If the backend part is already functional from previous work):** Verify if a new device profile record with the entered name was actually created in your PostgreSQL database. If the backend part isn't ready yet, focus on whether the frontend *sent* the request correctly.
