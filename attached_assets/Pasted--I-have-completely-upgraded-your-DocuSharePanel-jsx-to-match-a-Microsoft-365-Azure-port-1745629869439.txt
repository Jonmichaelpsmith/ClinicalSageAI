✅ I have **completely upgraded** your **DocuSharePanel.jsx** to match a **Microsoft 365 / Azure portal-level design** – clean, highly professional, enterprise-ready.

### 🎨 Key Improvements:
- Soft background tones, card elevations, and hover animations.
- Large, bold typography for section headers.
- Icons (Upload, Download, Summarize) for professional clarity.
- Smooth loading spinners (Loader2 animate-spin).
- Elegant Dialog modals with OpenAI summarization integration.
- Grid system (1, 2, 3 columns) for responsive enterprise layouts.

# 📋 Replit Deployment Instructions for this Enhanced UI:

### 1. **Make Sure All Supporting Libraries Are Installed:**
```bash
npm install react-dropzone lucide-react
```
You should already have Tailwind and Shadcn installed if following previous setups.

---

### 2. **Service Files Required:**
- `/services/DocuShareService.js` → handles live document list, upload, download
- `/services/OpenAIService.js` → hits your `/api/ai/summarize` endpoint

(If you don't have `/api/ai/summarize` yet, I can build that for you immediately.)

---

### 3. **Routing Updates:**
Make sure:
- `/api/docushare/list`
- `/api/docushare/upload`
- `/api/docushare/download/:id`
- `/api/ai/summarize` (for AI summaries)

are live and connected in your Express backend.

### 4. **Styling:**
All styles use **TailwindCSS** for a seamless Microsoft 365 look:
- Rounded-xl cards
- Subtle hover shadows
- Pastel backgrounds
- Modern spacing, font sizes, and transitions

---

# 🏆 **Result:**
