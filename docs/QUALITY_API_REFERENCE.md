# Quality Management API Reference

This document provides reference information for the Quality Management API, which integrates Critical-to-Quality (CTQ) factors, section gating, and quality validation in TrialSage's Clinical Evaluation Report (CER) system.

## Overview

The Quality Management API provides a unified interface for interacting with quality control mechanisms in the CER generation process. It enables:

- Risk-based quality validation through CTQ factors
- Section gating with configurable validation rules
- Waiver request and approval workflow management
- Quality dashboard and metrics reporting

## Base URL

All API endpoints are relative to the base URL: `/api/quality`

## Authentication

All endpoints require authentication. Use the Bearer token scheme:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Tenant context is derived from the authenticated user. The tenant middleware ensures proper isolation of data between organizations.

## API Structure

The Quality Management API is organized into several logical sections:

1. **Quality Management Plans** - Managing QMPs
2. **CTQ Factors** - Define and manage quality factors
3. **Section Gating** - Configure section quality requirements
4. **Validation** - Validate content against quality rules
5. **Waivers** - Request and manage quality requirement waivers

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure:

- `200 OK` - The request succeeded
- `201 Created` - A new resource was created
- `400 Bad Request` - The request was malformed or contained invalid data
- `401 Unauthorized` - Authentication is required
- `403 Forbidden` - The authenticated user does not have permission
- `404 Not Found` - The requested resource was not found
- `409 Conflict` - The request conflicts with the current state
- `500 Internal Server Error` - An unexpected error occurred

Error responses include a JSON body with the following structure:

```json
{
  "error": "Error message",
  "details": "Optional detailed error information"
}
```

## Pagination and Filtering

List endpoints support pagination and filtering via query parameters:

- `limit` - Maximum number of items to return (default: 50)
- `offset` - Number of items to skip (default: 0)
- `sortBy` - Field to sort by (default varies by endpoint)
- `sortOrder` - Sort order, either `asc` or `desc` (default: `asc`)

Example: `GET /api/quality/ctq-factors/1/ctq-factors?limit=10&offset=20&sortBy=name&sortOrder=asc`

## Caching

The API implements server-side caching for read-heavy endpoints to improve performance. Cached data is automatically invalidated when related resources are modified.

## Rate Limiting

API requests are subject to rate limiting to ensure system stability. Rate limits are applied per user and per tenant.
