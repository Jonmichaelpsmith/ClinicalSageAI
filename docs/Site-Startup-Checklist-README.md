# Site-Startup Checklist Builder

The Site-Startup Checklist Builder is an advanced module within TrialSage Vault™ designed to accelerate clinical trial site activation by automatically generating comprehensive, country-specific regulatory requirements checklists and tracking their progress.

## Overview

Clinical trial site activation is one of the most time-consuming phases of study startup, often delayed by complex country-specific regulatory requirements and document submissions. The Site-Startup Checklist Builder leverages AI and a comprehensive regulatory database to instantly generate tailored checklists for each site based on study type, therapeutic area, and geographic location.

### Data Model

The checklist system is built around a flexible data model:

```javascript
{
  studyId: "STUDY-123",
  siteId: "SITE-456",
  country: "Germany",
  requirements: [
    {
      id: "REQ-001",
      category: "Regulatory",
      title: "Ethics Committee Approval",
      description: "Obtain approval from local ethics committee",
      required: true,
      countrySpecific: true,
      status: "pending",
      dueDate: "2025-05-15",
      assignedTo: "user-789",
      documents: [
        {
          documentId: "DOC-123",
          version: "1.2",
          status: "submitted",
          submittedDate: "2025-04-20",
          approvalStatus: "pending"
        }
      ]
    }
    // Additional requirements...
  ],
  metrics: {
    totalRequirements: 42,
    completedRequirements: 18,
    progressPercentage: 42.85,
    estimatedCompletionDate: "2025-06-10",
    criticalPathItems: ["REQ-001", "REQ-008"]
  }
}
```
