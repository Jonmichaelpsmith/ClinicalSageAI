# Auto-Retention Scheduler Documentation

## Overview

The Auto-Retention Scheduler is a compliance-focused feature that automates document retention according to configurable policies. It helps organizations maintain regulatory compliance by ensuring documents are retained for appropriate periods of time and properly managed throughout their lifecycle.

## Key Features

- **Configurable Retention Policies:** Define custom retention periods based on document types
- **Document Archiving:** Automatically archive documents before deletion
- **Email Notifications:** Receive alerts before documents reach retention limits
- **Audit Logging:** Comprehensive activity trails for compliance verification
- **Manual Override:** Run retention jobs on demand
- **Secure Operations:** Role-based access control for policy management

## Architecture

The Auto-Retention Scheduler consists of several components:

1. **Policy Management Interface:** Web UI for creating and managing retention policies
2. **Scheduled Jobs:** Automated background processes that execute retention operations
3. **Notification System:** Alerts users when documents approach retention limits
4. **Validation Middleware:** Ensures data integrity for all operations
5. **Audit Logging System:** Records all retention-related activities
6. **CLI Tools:** Command-line interface for manual job execution

## Security & Compliance

The Auto-Retention Scheduler was designed with security and compliance as top priorities:

- **21 CFR Part 11 Compliance:** All operations are fully audited with tamper-evident logs
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Only authorized administrators can manage policies
- **Validation Checks:** Input validation for all operations with secure error handling
- **Audit Trail:** SHA-256 integrity hashes ensure log integrity
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive usage documentation and audit reports

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Job appears stuck:** Check for database connection issues or file system permissions
