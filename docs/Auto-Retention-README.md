# Auto-Retention Scheduler Module

The Auto-Retention Scheduler is a sophisticated document lifecycle management system integrated into TrialSage Vault™. It automates the enforcement of document retention policies while ensuring full regulatory compliance and record-keeping.

## Features

### Core Capabilities

- **Policy Definition**: Create and manage document retention rules by document type, department, and regulatory requirements
- **Automatic Archiving**: Documents are automatically archived before deletion for potential future reference
- **Proactive Notifications**: Email alerts sent before documents reach retention limits
- **Audit Logging**: Complete trails with SHA-256 integrity hashing
- **CLI Tool**: Command-line interface for manual job execution
- **Retention Dashboard**: Visual metrics and statistics on retention operations

### Technical Components

- **Validation Middleware**: Server-side validation ensures all retention policies meet regulatory requirements
- **Cron Scheduler**: Background job system for executing retention tasks
- **Audit System**: Comprehensive logging with blockchain-verified integrity
- **User Interface**: Administrative console for policy management and monitoring

## Policy Configuration

Retention policies can be configured with the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| documentType | Type of document | "SOP", "Protocol", "CSR" |
| retentionPeriod | Time to retain in days | 365, 730, 1825 |
| notificationDays | When to send alerts before deletion | 30, 60, 90 |
| department | Department owning the document | "Regulatory", "Clinical", "QA" |
| archiveBeforeDelete | Whether to archive before deletion | true, false |
| requireApproval | Whether deletion requires approval | true, false |

## Implementation Architecture

The Auto-Retention Scheduler is implemented as a modular component within the Vault™ Workspace system:

```
server/
  ├── routes/
  │   └── retention.js      # API endpoints for retention management
  ├── middleware/
  │   └── validation.js     # Validation rules for retention policies
  ├── jobs/
  │   └── retentionCron.js  # Scheduled job for executing retention policies
  ├── bin/
  │   └── run-retention.js  # CLI tool for manual execution
  └── utils/
      └── audit-logger.js   # Audit logging for retention operations

client/
  ├── pages/
  │   └── RetentionSettings.jsx  # Administrative interface
  └── components/
      └── RetentionDashboard.jsx # Metrics and reporting dashboard
```

## API Endpoints

The module exposes the following REST API endpoints:

- **GET /api/retention/policies** - List all retention policies
- **POST /api/retention/policies** - Create a new retention policy
- **PUT /api/retention/policies/:id** - Update an existing policy
- **DELETE /api/retention/policies/:id** - Delete a policy
- **GET /api/retention/documents** - Get documents eligible for retention
- **GET /api/retention/dashboard** - Get retention dashboard metrics
- **POST /api/retention/execute** - Manually execute retention job

## Security Considerations

The Auto-Retention Scheduler implements several security features:

1. **Role-Based Access Control**: Only authorized administrators can configure retention policies
2. **Audit Trails**: All operations are logged with timestamps, user information, and actions
3. **SHA-256 Integrity**: Cryptographic verification of audit trail integrity
4. **Blockchain Verification**: Optional immutable record of document deletion operations
5. **Approval Workflow**: Multi-step approval process for high-value document deletion

## Compliance

The module is designed to comply with:

- **21 CFR Part 11** - Electronic Records and Signatures
- **GxP Guidelines** - Good Practice guidelines for life sciences
- **ISO 27001** - Information Security Standard
- **GDPR** - Data Protection requirements for EU
- **HIPAA** - Health Information Privacy (US)

## Dashboard Metrics

The retention dashboard provides the following metrics:

- **Documents Retained**: Total documents under retention management
- **Upcoming Deletions**: Documents scheduled for deletion in next 30/60/90 days
- **Completed Actions**: Retention actions completed in the past period
- **Policy Compliance**: Percentage of documents compliant with retention policies
- **Storage Reclaimed**: Storage space freed through document lifecycle management

## CLI Tool Usage

The command-line tool supports the following options:

```bash
# List all retention policies
node server/bin/run-retention.js --list-policies

# Execute retention job for all policies
node server/bin/run-retention.js --execute-all

# Execute retention for specific policy
node server/bin/run-retention.js --execute-policy=<policy-id>

# Generate retention report
node server/bin/run-retention.js --generate-report

# Preview documents eligible for deletion
node server/bin/run-retention.js --preview-deletion
```

## Testing

The module includes comprehensive automated tests:

```
test/
  └── retention.test.js  # Unit and integration tests for retention features
```

Tests cover:

- Policy validation
- Retention job execution
- Audit logging
- API endpoints
- Error handling

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for future releases:

1. **Machine Learning Integration**: AI-powered recommendations for retention policy optimization
2. **Legal Hold Management**: Enhanced capabilities for managing documents under legal hold
3. **Cross-System Integration**: Connect with external enterprise systems for unified retention management
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Enhanced reporting on document lifecycle metrics
5. **Global Regulatory Updates**: Automatic policy adjustments based on regulatory changes
