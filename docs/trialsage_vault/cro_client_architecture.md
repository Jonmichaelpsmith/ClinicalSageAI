# TrialSage Vault: CRO Multi-Client Architecture Blueprint

## Executive Summary

This blueprint enhances the TrialSage Vault platform to support Contract Research Organizations (CROs) managing multiple biotech clients within a unified system. The architecture provides robust tenant isolation, hierarchical organization structures, and role-based security while maintaining regulatory compliance across all client relationships.

## CRO-Client Hierarchy Structure

### Multi-Tier Organization Model

The platform implements a four-tier hierarchical structure:

1. **CRO Organization (Top Level)**
   - The Contract Research Organization entity that manages multiple biotech clients
   - Has organization-wide administrators, templates, and governance policies
   - Can view aggregated analytics across all clients (with appropriate isolation)

2. **Biotech Client (Second Level)**
   - Individual pharmaceutical/biotech companies as clients of the CRO
   - Complete data isolation between clients
   - Client-specific administrators, users, and settings

3. **Programs (Third Level)**
   - Major therapeutic areas or product development initiatives within a client
   - Contains related studies and shared resources
   - Program-level administrators and cross-study visibility

4. **Studies (Fourth Level)**
   - Individual clinical trials or research studies
   - Study-specific documents, timelines, and team members
   - Granular permissions for study access

### Tenant Isolation Implementation

To ensure complete data separation between clients while allowing CRO oversight:

1. **Row-Level Security (RLS)**
   - Every database table with client data includes `cro_id` and `client_id` columns
   - PostgreSQL RLS policies automatically filter data based on user context
   - Ensures queries can only access authorized client data

2. **Schema Isolation (Optional)**
   - For highest-security clients, dedicated database schemas
   - Allows physical separation while maintaining unified management

3. **Storage Partitioning**
   - Document storage organized by client/program/study hierarchy
   - Encryption keys managed per client for additional separation
   - Backup and retention policies configurable per client

4. **Cross-Client Functionality**
   - Configurable templates and standards that can be shared across clients
   - Anonymized performance benchmarking (opt-in)
   - Global knowledge base with client-specific extensions

## Enhanced Database Schema

The database schema extends the base TrialSage Vault architecture with specific enhancements for CRO multi-client support:
