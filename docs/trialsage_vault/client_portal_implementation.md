## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend will be built as a React single-page application (SPA) using the following technologies:

- **React 18+** for component-based UI development
- **Vite** for fast development and optimization
- **TanStack Query** for data fetching and state management
- **Tailwind CSS** and **ShadcnUI** for styling and UI components
- **Wouter** for routing
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **React Hook Form** for form handling
- **Zod** for schema validation

The frontend will be organized into the following structure:

```
client/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── common/       # Shared UI components
│   │   ├── vault/        # Vault-specific components

├── controllers/          # Business logic
├── services/             # Service layer for external integrations
├── models/               # Data models and database access
├── middlewares/          # Express middlewares
