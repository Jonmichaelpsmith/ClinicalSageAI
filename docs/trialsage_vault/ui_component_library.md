## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Component Organization**
   - Use a consistent folder structure for components
   - Maintain separation of concerns (presentation vs. logic)
   - Document props and usage patterns
   - Include accessibility considerations

2. **Styling Approach**
   - Use Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Maintain consistent color scheme based on theme
   - Ensure responsive behavior for all components
   - Follow WCAG AA accessibility guidelines

3. **State Management**
   - Use React state for simple component state
   - Leverage React Query for server state
   - Consider context for shared state
   - Document state dependencies

4. **Performance Considerations**
   - Implement virtualization for long lists
   - Use React.memo for expensive components
   - Optimize re-renders with proper dependency arrays
   - Lazy load components when appropriate

5. **Testing Strategy**
   - Create unit tests for component rendering
   - Test interactive behavior with user event simulation
   - Include accessibility testing
   - Verify responsive behavior
