# SOP Training Workflow Module

The SOP Training Workflow module is an advanced component of TrialSage Vault™ that automates the assignment, tracking, and verification of training tasks when Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) reach "Effective" status.

## Overview

Maintaining compliance with SOPs is critical in regulated industries. This module ensures that when SOPs are created or updated, appropriate personnel are automatically assigned training tasks, with tracking of completion status and knowledge verification.

## Key Features

- **Cascading Requirements**: Handle prerequisite and sequential training requirements
- **Version-Specific Training**: Track training status across document versions

### Training Management

- **Due Date Calculation**: Automatically set training deadlines based on configurable rules
- **Notification System**: Automated reminders for pending and overdue training
- **Escalation Paths**: Configurable escalation to supervisors for overdue training
- **Bulk Assignment**: Mass assignment capabilities for organizational changes

- **Question Bank**: Maintain a library of validation questions for each SOP
- **Minimum Passing Scores**: Configurable thresholds for successful completion
- **Remedial Training**: Automatic assignment of additional resources for failed assessments

### Compliance Reporting

- **Training Compliance Dashboard**: Real-time visibility into organization-wide compliance status
- **Manager View**: Department-specific compliance metrics and pending training
- **Individual Training History**: Complete training record for each employee
- **Regulatory Inspection Support**: Predefined reports for audits and inspections
- **Certificate Generation**: Automatic creation of training certificates upon completion

### Data Model

The SOP Training system is built around a comprehensive data model:

```javascript
{
  trainingId: "TRN-2025-789",
  documentId: "SOP-2025-123",
  documentVersion: "2.0",
  documentTitle: "Laboratory Sample Processing",

  assignedTo: {
    userId: "user-456",
    name: "Jane Smith",
    department: "Clinical Operations",
    role: "Clinical Research Associate"
  },
  assignedBy: {
    userId: "user-789",
    name: "John Manager",
    method: "Automatic" // or "Manual"
  },
  status: "Assigned", // Assigned, In Progress, Completed, Overdue, Failed
  verificationMethod: "Quiz",
  assessment: {
    assessmentId: "QUIZ-123",
    questions: [
      {
        questionId: "Q1",
        text: "What is the required temperature for sample storage?",
        type: "multiple-choice",
        options: [
          { id: "A", text: "Room temperature" },
          { id: "B", text: "-20°C" },
          { id: "C", text: "-80°C" },
          { id: "D", text: "2-8°C" }
        ],
        correctAnswer: "C",
        pointValue: 1
      },
      // Additional questions...
    ],
    passingScore: 80,
    attempts: [
      {
        attemptId: "ATT-001",
        date: "2025-04-12",
        score: 90,
        passed: true,
        answers: [

        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  completion: {
    completedDate: "2025-04-12",
    status: "Passed",
    score: 90,
    attestation: "I confirm I have read and understand this SOP",
    certificateId: "CERT-456"
  },
  notifications: [
    {
      notificationId: "NOTE-001",
