# Promotional Review (MLR) Workflow

The Promotional Review (MLR) Workflow is an advanced module within TrialSage Vault™ designed to streamline the medical, legal, and regulatory review process for promotional materials with AI-powered claim analysis.

## Overview

Promotional material review is a critical compliance process for pharmaceutical and life sciences companies. The MLR Workflow module provides a structured, efficient process for reviewing promotional claims while leveraging AI to automatically identify potentially unsupported statements before human review begins.

## Key Features

### AI Claim Analysis Process

The AI claim analysis engine follows a sophisticated process to identify and assess promotional claims:

1. **Text Extraction**: Processes submitted content (documents, web pages, presentations)
2. **Claim Identification**: Uses NLP to identify statements that constitute promotional claims
3. **Reference Scanning**: Analyzes the document's references and your reference library
4. **Evidence Matching**: Attempts to match each claim with supporting evidence
5. **Risk Evaluation**: Assesses each claim based on:
   - Strength of supporting evidence
   - Regulatory precedent for similar claims
   - Presence of absolute statements or superlatives
   - Comparison claims against competitors
   - Off-label implications
6. **Report Generation**: Creates a comprehensive analysis for reviewer reference

## Data Model

The promotional review system is built around a flexible data model:
