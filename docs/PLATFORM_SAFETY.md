# TrialSage Platform Safety Guide

This document outlines the comprehensive safety system implemented in the TrialSage platform to prevent data loss, protect against system failures, and ensure development stability.

## Safety System Overview

The TrialSage safety system consists of multiple interconnected layers:

1. **Regular Backups** - Full system backups on demand
2. **Component Snapshots** - Individual component versioning
3. **Component Recovery** - Fast restoration of components
4. **Verification Tools** - Code quality and integrity checks
5. **Pre-Commit Safety** - Automated safety sequence before changes
6. **Safety Checklist** - Process documentation for critical changes

## Available Safety Tools

### Backup Tools

- **Full Backup**: `./scripts/backup.sh`
  - Creates a timestamped archive of critical system components
  - Stores backups in the `/backups` directory
  - Includes file inventory for reference

### Component Snapshot System

- **Create Snapshot**: `./scripts/create_component_snapshot.sh [component_path]`
  - Creates a versioned copy of a specific component
  - Useful before making significant changes
  - Example: `./scripts/create_component_snapshot.sh client/src/components/cer/GSPRMappingPanel.jsx`

### Recovery Tools

- **Component Recovery**: `./scripts/recover_component.sh [component_path] [version]`
  - Lists available snapshots for a component
  - Restores a component to a specific version point
  - Creates backup of current version before restoration
  - Example: `./scripts/recover_component.sh client/src/components/cer/GSPRMappingPanel.jsx 20250508142731`

### Verification Tools

- **Component Verification**: `./scripts/verify_components.sh`
  - Checks for syntax errors in JavaScript/JSX files
  - Identifies common coding issues
  - Scans for duplicate declarations
  - Validates balanced brackets and parentheses

### Pre-Commit Safety System

- **Safety Sequence**: `./scripts/pre_commit_safety.sh [component_path]`
  - Runs all safety checks in sequence
  - Creates a detailed safety report
  - Provides clear go/no-go guidance for changes
  - Example: `./scripts/pre_commit_safety.sh client/src/components/cer/GSPRMappingPanel.jsx`

## Recommended Safety Procedures

### For Routine Development

1. Create component snapshots before changes
2. Run verification after changes
3. Document significant changes

### For Critical Component Changes

1. Run the full pre-commit safety sequence
2. Review the safety report
3. Proceed only if all checks pass
4. Create a new snapshot after successful changes

### For Emergency Recovery

1. Identify available recovery options using `./scripts/recover_component.sh [component_path]`
2. Restore from the most recent working snapshot
3. Verify system functionality after recovery
4. Document the incident and recovery process

## Safety System Directory Structure

- `/backups` - System backup archives
- `/snapshots` - Component version snapshots
- `/safety_logs` - Safety reports and logs
- `/scripts` - Safety tools and utilities
- `/docs` - Safety documentation

## Best Practices

1. **Create Regular Backups**: Run `./scripts/backup.sh` daily during active development
2. **Snapshot Before Changes**: Always snapshot components before significant modifications
3. **Verify After Changes**: Run verification checks after completing changes
4. **Review Safety Reports**: Read safety reports carefully before proceeding with changes
5. **Document Recovery Actions**: Keep notes of any recovery procedures used
