      "description": "RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy before a donor bone marrow transplant helps stop the\r\ngrowth of cancer cells. It also helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the\r\ndonor's stem cells. Also, monoclonal antibodies, such as gemtuzumab ozogamicin, can find\r\ncancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without\r\nharming normal cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the\r\npatient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white\r\nblood cells, and platelets.\r\n\r\nPURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well gemtuzumab ozogamicin works in treating\r\nyoung patients who are undergoing remission induction, intensification therapy, and\r\nallogeneic bone marrow transplant for newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia.",

Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMDs), which affect up\r\nto 10% of the adult population, are a prime example of such conditions. Traditional\r\ntreatment outcomes for TMD pain are often unsatisfactory. Moreover, in women age 25-55\r\n(the age-sex group most affected), TMD is often found in association with depression,\r\nanxiety, sleep disturbances, gastrointestinal symptoms, frequent infection,and\r\nfibromyalgia. Because these multiple and complex symptoms suggest a loss of spirit or\r\nlife energy, they may be particularly susceptible to treatment by shamanic (spiritual)\r\nhealing, which aims to bring disturbed physical, mental, and emotional systems into\r\nbalance. This phase I study will develop methods to evaluate shamanic healing as an\r\nintervention for TMD and will evaluate the feasibility of conducting randomized clinical\r\ntrials of shamanic healing.",

      "description": "This study will evaluate the effects of levetiracetam (Keppra (Trademark) on Parkinson's\r\ndisease symptoms and on dyskinesias (involuntary movements) that develop as a result of\r\nlong-term treatment with levodopa. Levetiracetam blocks certain protein receptors on\r\nbrain cells and thus can change the spread of brain signals believed to be affected in\r\npatients with Parkinson's disease.\r\n\r\nPatients between 30 and 80 years of age with relatively advanced Parkinson's disease and\r\ndyskinesias due to levodopa therapy may be eligible for this 6-week study.\r\n\r\nScreening and baseline evaluation - Participants are evaluated with a medical history,\r\nphysical examination and neurologic evaluation, blood tests, urinalysis,\r\nelectrocardiogram (EKG), 24-hour holter monitor (heart monitoring), and cardiology\r\nconsultation. A chest x-ray and MRI or CT scan of the brain are done if needed. If\r\npossible, patients stop taking all antiparkinsonian medications except levodopa (Sinemet)\r\nfor one month (2 months if taking Selegiline) before the study begins and throughout its\r\nduration. (If necessary, patients may use short-acting agents, such as Mirapex, Requip or\r\nAmantadine.)\r\n\r\nDose-finding phase - Patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for 2 to 3 days for\r\na levodopa \"dose-finding\" procedure. For this test, patients stop taking Sinemet and\r\ninstead have levodopa infused through a vein. During the infusions, the drug dose is\r\nincreased slowly until parkinsonian symptoms improve or unacceptable side effects occur\r\nor the maximum study dose is reached. Symptoms are monitored frequently. (Patients who\r\nhave had dosing infusions in the last 3 months do not have to undergo this phase of the\r\nstudy.)\r\n\r\nActive study phase - Patients are randomly assigned to take levetiracetam or placebo\r\n(\"sugar pill\") twice a day for 6 weeks. At the end of weeks 1, 2 4, and 5, patients come\r\nto the clinic for blood tests, an EKG, and a review of adverse side effects. At the end\r\nof weeks 3 and 6, patients are hospitalized to study the response to treatment. They\r\nagain stop taking Sinemet and selegiline and their ability to perform motor tasks is\r\nevaluated. They are then placed on an L-dopa infusion for 10 hours. Placebo may be\r\ninfused at various times instead of L-dopa. Motor symptoms are evaluated several times\r\nduring the infusion. Blood is drawn once during the infusion for research studies.\r\n\r\nLumbar puncture - Patients undergo a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) at the end of weeks 1\r\nand 4 to measure certain brain chemicals and drug levels. For this test, a local\r\nanesthetic is given and a needle is inserted in the space between the vertebrae in the\r\nlower back. About 2 tablespoons of fluid is collected through the needle.\r\n\r\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - Patients with changing disease activity may undergo\r\nMRIs at baseline, at the end of week 1 and at the end of the study to show changes in the\r\nbrain. The patient lies in a narrow cylinder (the scanner) that uses radio waves and a\r\nmagnetic field to produce images of the brain, which show structural and chemical\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nFollow-up - 2 weeks after the study ends, patients are contacted by phone for a review of\r\nside effects or they return to the clinic for an evaluation.",
      "detailedDescription": "Introduction: Parkinson's disease is a progressive degenerative disease of unknown\r\netiology. Its treatment has been symptomatic and the most successful approach has been to\r\nreplace the missing dopamine through administration of its precursor levodopa. As the\r\ndisease progresses the usefulness of this approach gradually diminishes and motor\r\ncomplications become a source of significant disability. Although a number of\r\npharmacological strategies have attempted to improve this situation, none has yet proven\r\nfully satisfactory. The mechanism by which levetiracetam exerts this beneficial effect is\r\nunknown. Recently, in a PD monkey model levetiracetam was found to moderate dyskinesias\r\nand other motor complications, possibly due to its effects on striatal GABAergic\r\ntransmission.\r\n\r\nObjective: To evaluate the acute ability of levetiracetam to safely ameliorate\r\ndopaminomimetic-treatment-associated dyskinesias and related motor complications in\r\nparkinsonian patients without compromising the antiparkinsonian response.\r\n\r\nStudy Population: 22 moderately advanced parkinsonian patients will be enrolled into a\r\nrandomized, placebo controlled, double-blind proof-of-principle study. Levetiracetam\r\nefficacy will be assessed through the use of validated motor function scales. Safety will\r\nbe monitored by means of frequent clinical evaluations and laboratory tests.\r\n\r\nAnticipated Risks and Benefits: The potential risks associated with this study amount to\r\nonly a minor increase over minimal risk and are primarily associated with adverse\r\nreactions to the medications involved. Levetiracetam is a marketed drug with a wide\r\nmargin of safety. Patients receiving drug could benefit from improvement of their\r\nsymptoms, those on placebo will also have their medications adjusted, leading to an\r\nimproved quality of life.\r\n\r\nOutcome Estimate and Potential Meaning for the Field: This study should further the\r\nunderstanding of mechanisms contributing to motor disability in patients with PD that may\r\nlead to the development of improved therapeutic interventions for this disorder and for\r\nassociated motor response complications.",

      "detailedDescription": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic disease causing deterioration of the joint cartilage and\r\nthe formation of bone spurs at the margins of the joints. Knee OA causes substantial\r\npain, suffering, and disability, as well as enormous economic burden on the patient;\r\nunfortunately, treatment provides relief but not a cure. The majority of patients with\r\nsymptomatic knee OA do not attain satisfactory long-term relief, even with recent\r\nadvances in pain relievers. Analgesic treatment may relieve the pain but does not improve\r\nbiomechanics and may even aggravate OA.\r\n\r\nAlthough OA is complex and not completely understood, disease onset and progression are\r\nat least partly related to responses by bone and cartilage to biomechanical loading.\r\nDevices that promote pressure reduction from the medial knee may provide pain relief\r\nwhile simultaneously protecting the joint from further degeneration; one such device is a\r\nlateral wedge orthotic shoe insert. When worn during weight-bearing activity, these\r\ninserts have been shown to reduce loading of the medial compartment and may provide pain\r\nrelief. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of orthotic shoe inserts in\r\ncontrolling and relieving knee OA. The study will also assess improvements in loading\r\nbiomechanics of the knee.\r\n\r\nThis is a 3-year study. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups; the\r\nfirst group will receive lateral wedge orthotic inserts and the second group will receive\r\nstandard orthotic inserts. There will be 10 study visits during the course of the study.\r\nPatients will undergo X-rays and bone mineral density testing (DEXA) and 3 blood\r\ncollections during the course of the study.",

Since the emergence of the HIV epidemic in\r\nAfrica, the incidence rates of TB have risen dramatically, overwhelming national TB\r\ncontrol programs across the continent. Over 50% of TB patients presenting to TB clinics\r\nin Africa are HIV infected. These patients often present in the early stages of HIV\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\nRecent World Health Organization guidelines on the management of HIV-associated pulmonary\r\nTB recommend antiretroviral (ARV) therapy in patients with CD4 cells less than 200\r\ncells/mm3, but not for HIV infected TB patients who present with a high CD4 count. In\r\nUganda, over half of HIV infected patients with active TB present to TB clinics with CD4\r\ncounts above 200 cells/mm3, and there is evidence that coinfected patients with a high\r\nCD4 count should be treated with ARV therapy. First, mortality in HIV-associated TB is\r\nhigh, even when patients respond to effective anti-tuberculosis therapy. Second, excess\r\nmortality associated with TB is most evident when CD4 counts are above 200 cell/mm3.\r\nThird, in coinfected patients, TB results in prolonged immune activation, which may\r\nenhance viral replication and accelerate the decline of CD4 cells.\r\n\r\nThis study will evaluate whether short-term ARV therapy of abacavir sulfate, lamivudine,\r\nand zidovudine given during treatment of active TB will slow progression of HIV disease\r\nin TB patients with CD4 counts of at least 350 cells/mm3. The study will also assess the\r\npossible risks (e.g., drug toxicities and resistance) and benefits (e.g., more rapid\r\nclearance of mycobacterium tuberculosis and reduced TB relapse) of punctuated ARV\r\ntherapy.\r\n\r\nParticipants in this study will be HIV infected TB patients with CD4 counts of at least\r\n350 cells/mm3. All participants will receive treatment for TB. Participants will be\r\nrandomly assigned to receive 6 months of ARV therapy or to delay ARV therapy until CD4\r\ncounts drop below 250 cells/mm3. The participants will be followed for 2 years; CD4\r\ncounts will be compared between groups.\r\n\r\nThis study will also follow a group of HIV infected patients without active TB to\r\nquantify the extent to which CD4 cell decline is accelerated with active TB and to\r\ndetermine the extent to which a decline is neutralized in patients who receive punctuated\r\nARV therapy.",

Compare capacity, policy and, second-hand\r\nsmoke exposure and smoking rates in selected provinces to national levels.",
      "detailedDescription": "China is a particularly critical country for global tobacco control. It has the world's\r\nlargest number of smokers, approximately 350 million, and the immense market afforded by\r\nthe 60 percent of men who smoke and the 95 percent of women who do not smoke represents a\r\nprize target for the multinational tobacco companies. China has ratified the Framework\r\nConvention for Tobacco Control (FCTC) and now needs to implement its provisions across a\r\nlarge and diverse population. In this application, we propose a program of evidence-based\r\ncommunity interventions to be implemented at the province and local levels with the\r\noverall objective of developing an approach for implementation nationally.\r\n\r\nThis application builds on a long-standing partnership between the Chinese Center for\r\nDisease Control and Prevention (China CDC), the Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) and\r\nthe Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. That partnership began in 1995 with\r\nan agreement to collaborate on the conduct of China's 1996 national smoking survey. Our\r\nprincipal collaborator over those years, Dr. Gong-Huan Yang, is now Deputy Director of\r\nthe China CDC and responsible for tobacco control at the national level. In the four\r\nyears of funding to date from the Fogarty International Center (FIC), we have carried out\r\na project in selected communities in three provinces, including urban and rural areas\r\nthat provide a foundation for the intervention approach in this proposal. Specifically,\r\nwe have carried out quantitative and qualitative studies to assess barriers to tobacco\r\ncontrol and readiness for interventions, measured levels of airborne nicotine in key\r\npublic environments, and developed capacity-building approaches. Our original FIC\r\nsupported study involved three countries, China, Mexico and Brazil. However, this\r\napplication will focus solely on China, as the latter two countries developed the\r\nnecessary infrastructure and capacity to conduct research, publish their research\r\nfindings, and seek further grants and government funding to sustain progress.\r\n\r\nThis application proposes a tobacco control study that will involve 7 provinces in a\r\nCDC-led initiative to develop a systematic mix of approaches. The plan uses strategies\r\nbased on experiences from our work in China and from the American Stop Smoking\r\nIntervention Study for Cancer Prevention (ASSIST) and anticipates barriers that have been\r\nidentified in the data collected to date. In the intervention provinces, the China CDC\r\nwill team with the provincial-level CDCs to assess capacity for tobacco control and the\r\ncurrent status of tobacco control, using an adapted version of the Strength of Tobacco\r\nControl (SOTC) index developed for evaluating ASSIST. This systematic characterization\r\nwill highlight capacity needs. An extensive capacity development program, based in\r\ndistance-based methods, will be used. We have the overall objective of preparing the\r\nChina CDC to implement a proven approach to tobacco control at the national level. A\r\nhousehold survey will be conducted and compared to the national survey results.\r\nSecond-hand smoking will be assessed in selected locations in the 7 provinces.",

A blood sample\r\nof about 2 ounces is also collected at this visit for DNA analysis to look for genes\r\nrelated to pain.\r\n\r\nVisit 2 - Oral Surgery\r\n\r\nUnder local anesthetic, participants undergo extraction of their lower right wisdom\r\ntooth. After surgery, the patient is moved to the MRI scanner for brain imaging over 1-2\r\nhours while the local anesthetic wears off. Patients may request a postoperative pain\r\ndrug (Toradol) during the procedure, if needed. When the scan is complete, patients are\r\ndismissed from the clinic with additional pain medication (flurbiprofen) to use at home\r\nas directed.",
      "detailedDescription": "Functional neuroimaging provides a powerful tool for understanding how the brain may be\r\ninvolved in the perception of pain. It has made it possible to identify areas of the\r\nbrain that are involved in the perception of experimental pain but very few studies have\r\nevaluated the sites in the brain that are activated during clinical pain and the effects\r\nof analgesic drugs. The proposed study will use the surgical removal of an impacted third\r\nmolar as a model of acute clinical pain to identify sites that are activated following\r\nthe offset of local anesthesia and to examine the effects of the NSAID analgesic\r\nketorolac on attenuating sites that are activated as pain is relieved. Scans will be\r\nperformed under non-pain baseline conditions, and again immediately following surgery as\r\nthe local anesthetic wears off, clinical pain occurs, and following administration of the\r\nNSAID ketorolac. Differences among subjects in the amount of pain reported and brain\r\nactivation will be compared to subjects' prior ratings of experimental pain and the\r\npresence of any genetic polymorphisms that are related to pain perception, inflammation,\r\nknown pain pathways, or psychological factors related to pain. The findings from this\r\nresearch may help to reveal how pain is appreciated in the central nervous system,\r\npharmacologically modified by NSAID analgesics and differs among individuals due to\r\ngenetic factors.",

GW873140 is a new type of anti-HIV drug\r\ncalled a CCR5 receptor antagonist. CCR5 is a receptor on T cells (a type of white blood\r\ncell) where HIV-1 enters and then infects the cell. GW873140 is intended to block the\r\nCCR5 receptor so that HIV-1 cannot enter the cell.\r\n\r\nHIV-1-infected patients 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study.\r\nCandidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination,\r\nelectrocardiogram, and blood and urine tests. Some of the blood drawn is used to test the\r\npatient's HIV-1 type to see if the study drug might lower the amount of HIV-1 in the\r\nblood. Women who can become pregnant have a pregnancy test.\r\n\r\nParticipants are hospitalized for 12 days. They are randomly assigned to take one of the\r\nfollowing four treatments for 10 days: 1) 200 mg of GW873140 once a day, or placebo (a\r\nlook-alike pill with no active ingredient); 2) 200 mg of GW873140 twice a day, or\r\nplacebo; 3) 400 mg of GW873140 once a day, or placebo; or 600 mg of GW873140 twice a day,\r\nor placebo. Participants record the meals they eat on a diary card. In addition, they\r\nundergo the following tests and procedures:\r\n\r\nDuring treatment\r\n\r\n  -  Assessment of HIV classification (day 1)\r\n\r\n  -  Review of meal diary cards (days 1,2,3,4,5,8, and 10)\r\n\r\n  -  Review of any HIV-associated conditions, other medications taken besides the study\r\n     drug, and well-being (days 1,2,3,4,5,8,10, and 11)\r\n\r\n  -  Check of vital signs, including blood pressure, pulse, and temperature (days\r\n     1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10, and 11)\r\n\r\n  -  Weight assessment (days 1 and 10)\r\n\r\n  -  Electrocardiogram to measure the electrical activity of the heart (days 1,2,3,8, and\r\n     10)\r\n\r\n  -  Blood draws for routine laboratory tests, to measure T-cell counts, and to measure\r\n     HIV levels (days 1,2,5,10, and 11)\r\n\r\n  -  Urine tests (days 1 and 10)\r\n\r\nPost-treatment\r\n\r\n  -  Blood tests to monitor the effect of GW873140 on lowering HIV counts (days 12, 15,\r\n     17, and 19)\r\n\r\nFollow-up visit (2 weeks after last drug dose--day 24)\r\n\r\n  -  Review of medications taken and general well-being\r\n\r\n  -  Check of vital signs\r\n\r\n  -  Physical examination\r\n\r\n  -  Blood and urine tests.",
      "detailedDescription": "The development of resistance to all currently marketed drugs for HIV infection has been\r\nobserved and is a major reason for failure of therapy. In particular, there is a great\r\nneed for drugs against new targets and having novel mechanisms of action against new\r\ntargets. Most of the currently approved drugs are targeted toward the inhibition of viral\r\nenzymes. However, the process of viral entry and fusion has become an active area of\r\nresearch. Among the steps involved in viral entry, binding of HIV to CD4 co-receptors on\r\nthe cell surface is an important and promising target for new drug development.\r\n\r\nGW873140 is a CCR5 antagonist that is in Phase I clinical development as a viral entry\r\ninhibitor for the treatment of HIV infection. GW873140 has demonstrated in vitro\r\nantiviral activity with an IC50 against CCR5-tropic HIV-1 of 1nM equals about 0.5ng/mL),\r\nthat is shifted 8-10 fold (10nM equals about 0.5ng/mL) in the presence of physiological\r\nconcentrations of human plasma proteins. A study to investigate the safety, tolerability,\r\nand pharmacokinetics of escalating single (50-1200mg) and repeat (200-800mg BID) doses of\r\nGW873140 has been conducted in 70 healthy volunteers (GW873140/001). Preliminary results\r\nindicate that GW873140 is well-tolerated up to a dose of 1200 mg following single dose\r\nand 800 mg BID following multiple-dose. Additionally, food was shown to increase the AUC\r\nand Cmax of a 400 mg single dose by 1.7-and 2.2-fold, respectively.\r\n\r\nConcentrations above the protein binding corrected IC90 are achieved following oral\r\ndosing and in vivo binding studies in healthy subjects demonstrate greater than 97%\r\nreceptor occupancy 2 and 12 hours after multiple doses and 68-88% receptor occupancy 24\r\nhours after a single dose, despite plasma concentrations below or near detectable limits.",

      "description": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective treatment for severe or\r\nmedication-resistant depression and other psychiatric disorders. A common side effect of\r\nECT is problems with short-term memory during treatment. This study will test whether\r\ntaking ginkgo biloba (GB) prior to and during the course of ECT will lessen the effects\r\nof ECT on short-term memory.",
      "detailedDescription": "ECT is a safe and effective modern treatment for severe depression and other psychiatric\r\nconditions. An estimated 100,000 treatments occur per year in the United States. ECT's\r\nmost bothersome adverse effect is memory loss, with all patients receiving ECT\r\nexperiencing some degree of short-term cognitive impairment. At present there are no\r\nknown effective pharmacologic treatments to prevent or improve ECT-induced cognitive\r\ndysfunction. Preliminary research has shown the herbal preparation GB aids cognitive\r\nfunction and memory in both patients with dementia and in normal volunteers. This study\r\nwill investigate the utility and safety of GB to minimize the cognitive impairment\r\ntypically associated with ECT.\r\n\r\nParticipants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either twice-daily GB or\r\nplacebo. Participants will begin taking GB or placebo as soon as consent is obtained and\r\nbaseline testing is completed in order to reach steady-state plasma levels of GB prior to\r\nECT. Patients will undergo cognitive testing at specified intervals following ECT. The\r\nfinal study visit will occur one week after a participant's final ECT treatment.",

ALS is a disease of high priority to the VA,\r\nparticularly due to ongoing concerns about the health of veterans who served in the Gulf\r\nWar. Efforts are needed to systematically identify and track veterans with ALS.\r\nAccordingly, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is developing a national registry of\r\nveterans diagnosed with ALS.\r\n\r\nResearch Design: The registry will not be designed to test specific hypotheses but will\r\nfocus on comprehensive identification of veterans with ALS who may be eligible for other\r\nstudies.\r\n\r\nMethodology: Eligible participants will include all living veterans with a physician\r\ndiagnosis of ALS. Veterans with possible ALS will be identified through VA medical\r\nrecords, the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), and self-referral. Neurologists with\r\nexpertise in ALS will review veterans' medical records to verify the diagnosis and\r\ndetermine eligibility. Upon enrollment, veterans will be asked to complete a brief\r\ntelephone interview. Registry participants will also be contacted by telephone biannually\r\nto assess health and functional status.

In February 2004, based on the results of\r\nthe randomized trial of IFL +/- cetuximab showing a significant improvement in overall\r\nsurvival with cetuximab, cetuximab was approved by the FDA for use as front-line therapy\r\nfor patients with metastatic colon cancer. In response to this action, the Data Safety\r\nand Monitoring Board recommended closure of CALGB 80203. CALGB 80203 was subsequently\r\nclosed to accrual in January 2005 with 238 of the originally targeted 2200 patients\r\nenrolled. A final decision was to \"replace\" CALGB 80203 with a three-treatment arm\r\nrandomized trial of chemotherapy (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) with and without cetuximab and/or\r\nbevacizumab. The protocol was amended to allow analysis of the data from CALGB 80203 as a\r\nrandomized phase II trial and reporting of the results.\r\n\r\nPatients were stratified according to prior adjuvant chemotherapy (yes vs no) and prior\r\npelvic radiation (yes vs no). Patients must have completed any major surgery or\r\nradiotherapy (eg, chest or bone palliative RT or pelvic RT) \u2265 4 weeks from registration\r\nand completed any minor surgery \u2265 2 weeks from registration. Patients must have fully\r\nrecovered from the procedure and/or radiotherapy. Patients must have initiated treatment\r\nwithin 7 days of registration.

      "description": "Patients have a type of blood cell cancer, other blood disease or a genetic disease for\r\nwhich they will receive a stem cell transplant. The donor of the stem cells will be\r\neither a brother or sister or another relative or a closely matched unrelated donor. We\r\nare asking patients to participate in this study which tests if blood cells from the\r\ndonor that have been grown in a special way, can prevent the patients from getting an\r\ninfection with a virus called Cytomegalovirus or CMV.\r\n\r\nCMV is a virus that can cause serious infections in patients with suppressed immune\r\nsystems. It usually affects the lungs and can cause a very serious pneumonia, but it can\r\nalso affect the intestinal tract, the liver and the eyes. Approximately 2/3 of normal\r\npeople harbor this virus in their body. In healthy people CMV rarely causes any problems\r\nbecause the immune system can keep it under control. If the patient and/or their donor is\r\npositive for CMV, they are at risk of developing CMV disease while the patients immune\r\nsystem is weak post transplant. Usually, this risk is highest during the first 3-4 months\r\nafter the transplant.\r\n\r\nCMV disease can be prevented during this time in most people by using drugs that can kill\r\nthe virus such as Ganciclovir, Foscarnet, or Cidofovir . However, these medications have\r\nmany side effects and have to be given daily by vein for approximately 4-5 months after\r\ntransplant. One of the side effects is that it takes the new immune system much longer to\r\ndevelop an effective defense against the virus. Therefore, once the medicines are\r\nstopped, the patients still have a chance to develop CMV disease.\r\n\r\nWe want to see if we can use a kind of white blood cell called T cells that we have grown\r\nfrom the stem cell donor instead of the regular treatment with Ganciclovir or Foscarnet\r\nto prevent CMV from \"flaring up\". These cells have been trained to attack CMV virus\r\ninfected cells. We will grow these T cells from blood taken from the donor before the\r\npatients transplant. These cells are called CMV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes or CMV\r\nCTL, and they will be given to the patient around 30 days after their transplant.\r\n\r\nWe have used this sort of therapy to treat a different virus which can cause problems\r\nafter transplant called Epstein Barr Virus (EBV). Doctors at other places have used\r\nsimilar T cells to treat or prevent CMV infections after transplant and have not seen any\r\nsignificant problems. These CMV specific cytotoxic T cells are an investigational product\r\nnot approved by the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "detailedDescription": "If the patient and their donor are eligible, we will take 100-120 ml (20-24 teaspoonfuls)\r\nof blood from the donor 3-4 weeks before the transplant. We will only take as much blood\r\nas is safe for the patient and their donor.\r\n\r\nWe will use this blood to grow T cells. We will first infect the peripheral blood\r\nmononuclear cells with a specially produced human virus adenovirus) that carries part of\r\nthe CMV gene to the monocytes which will stimulate the T cells. This stimulation will\r\ntrain the T cells to kill cells with the pp65 from the CMV virus on their surface. If\r\nthis approach is insufficient to stimulate T cells which will kill the pp65 from the CMV\r\nvirus then we will grow a special type of cell called dendritic cells which will\r\nstimulate the T cells and we will put the specially produced human virus (adenovirus)\r\nthat carries the parts of the CMV gene (called pp65) into the dendritic cells. These\r\ndendritic cells will then be treated with radiation so they cannot grow. They will then\r\nbe used to stimulate T cells. This stimulation will train the T cells to kill cells with\r\nthe pp65 from the CMV virus on their surface.\r\n\r\nWe will then grow these CMV specific CTLs by more stimulation with EBV infected cells\r\n(which we will make from the blood of the donor by infecting them with EBV in the\r\nlaboratory). We will also put the adenovirus that carries the CMV pp65 gene into these\r\nEBV infected cells so that they too have CMVpp65. These EBV infected cells will be\r\ntreated with radiation so they cannot grow. Once we have made sufficient numbers of T\r\ncells we will test them to make sure they kill cells with CMVpp65 on their surface. To\r\nmake sure that these cells won't attack the patients tissues, we test these cells against\r\nthe lymphoblasts that we grow in the laboratory. These will be used to check if the CMV\r\nCTL can attack them. Alternatively, we could take a small piece of skin from the patient\r\nto grow skin cells which can also be used to check if CMV CTL can attack them. The skin\r\nbiopsy can be done at the same time of another procedure such as a bone marrow.\r\n\r\nThe donor's CMV CTL cells will be thawed and injected into the patients intravenous line\r\nfor a period of 10 minutes after the patient received Benadryl and Tylenol. The patient\r\nwill receive the dose of CMV CTL cells on or after day 30 following their transplant if\r\nthey agree and are well enough. We will not give antiviral medications during this study\r\nbut we will monitor the CMV levels weekly for at least 30 days after the transplant. If\r\nafter the initial dose of CMV CTL cells the patient develops a viral infection, then they\r\nmay be eligible to receive one additional injection of CTLs at the same dose as the first\r\ninjection. If the CMV levels in the blood continue to rise after the dose of T cells then\r\nthe patient will receive treatment with Ganciclovir, Foscarnet, or Cidofuvir.\r\n\r\nThe patient will continue to be followed in the BMT clinic after the injection. They will\r\nbe seen in the clinic, in the hospital or contacted by the research nurse and have blood\r\ntests (to monitor the blood counts, the kidney and liver function and to monitor for\r\nviruses) weekly for the first 60 days after the CTL infusion, then at 3, 6, 9 and 12\r\nmonths. To learn more about the way the T cells are working in the body, an extra 20-40\r\nmls (4-8 teaspoons) of blood will be taken before the infusion and then 24 hours after\r\nthe infusion (optional depending on the patients preference), and then at 1, 2, 4 and 6\r\nweeks after the infusion. After this, blood will be taken every 3 months for 1 year. The\r\namount of blood taken in the first 12 months will be 260-460mls (1-2 cups).

Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is\r\nnot yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective in treating\r\nnon-small cell lung cancer.\r\n\r\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well giving vinorelbine together\r\nwith gemcitabine and docetaxel works compared to giving paclitaxel together with\r\ncarboplatin in treating patients with stage IIIB, stage IV, or recurrent non-small cell\r\nlung cancer.",

      "description": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as leucovorin, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin,\r\nuse different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.\r\nCelecoxib may stop the growth of colorectal cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor\r\nand by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth. Combining chemotherapy with\r\ncelecoxib may kill more tumor cells.\r\n\r\nPURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining celecoxib with\r\nleucovorin, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin in treating patients who have metastatic\r\ncolorectal cancer.",

Patients also receive oral celecoxib twice daily beginning on day 1. Treatment\r\nrepeats every 14 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\r\ntoxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease stop treatment. If disease\r\nprogression occurs during the chemotherapy-free interval, patients receive an additional\r\n6 courses.\r\n\r\nPatients with responding disease after receiving at least 6 courses of chemotherapy may\r\nundergo surgery. Beginning within 10 weeks after surgery, patients receive simplified\r\nLV5FU2 chemotherapy comprising leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1, fluorouracil\r\nIV over 46 hours beginning on day 1, and oral celecoxib twice daily beginning on day 1.\r\nTreatment repeats every 14 days for at least 12 courses.\r\n\r\nQuality of life is assessed at baseline, during courses 4 and 6, and then every 2 months\r\nthereafter.\r\n\r\nPatients are followed at 1 month and then every 2 months thereafter.\r\n\r\nPROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 39 patients will be accrued for this study.",
