# CERV2Page.jsx Recovery Instructions

## Protection System Overview
The CERV2Page.jsx file has been protected with multiple layers of security to prevent loss or corruption.

## Quick Recovery Instructions

If CERV2Page.jsx becomes corrupted or broken:

### Option 1: Automated Integrity Validator (Recommended)
```bash
# Run the integrity validator script
./locked_files/cerv2_protected/integrity_validator.sh
```
This script will automatically:
1. Check if the file exists
2. Validate its integrity against the stored checksum
3. Offer to restore the protected backup if corruption is detected

### Option 2: Manual Recovery
```bash 
# Restore the primary backup
cp ./locked_files/cerv2_protected/CERV2Page.jsx client/src/pages/CERV2Page.jsx

# Restart the application workflow
# Use the UI to restart the application
```

### Option 3: Timestamped Recovery
If you need to recover a specific version:
```bash
# List all available timestamped backups
ls -la ./locked_files/cerv2_protected/CERV2Page_*.jsx

# Restore a specific timestamped version
cp ./locked_files/cerv2_protected/CERV2Page_20250514_004051.jsx client/src/pages/CERV2Page.jsx
```

### Option 4: Full System Recovery
If the entire protection system becomes corrupted:
```bash
# Extract the archive to restore all protection files
tar -xzvf ./locked_files/CERV2_PROTECTED_FULL_20250514_004056.tar.gz

# Then use one of the methods above to restore the actual file
```
