# TrialSage IND Package Solution - Project Brief for Google Gemini

## Project Overview

TrialSage is developing a comprehensive IND (Investigational New Drug) workflow management system that guides pharmaceutical/biotech companies from initial planning through final submission to regulatory authorities. Our platform combines document management, regulatory workflows, and AI assistance to streamline the IND preparation process.

## Current State Analysis

We've developed several core components but need to implement a comprehensive wizard-based interface to guide users through the complete IND preparation process. Current functionality includes:

1. **IND Sequence Management**
   - Basic tracking of submission sequences
   - Status visualization and filtering

2. **Document Builder & Management**
   - eCTD-compliant submission builder
   - Document version comparison

3. **Regulatory Compliance Features**
   - Regional validation (FDA, EMA, PMDA, Health Canada)
   - Technical validation tools

4. **Security Framework**
   - AES-256 encryption
   - API security measures

## Primary Development Goal

Create a comprehensive **IND Preparation Wizard** that guides users through all steps of creating an IND application, from initial planning to final submission.

## Required Components

We've outlined a detailed implementation plan in `IND_Wizard_Implementation_Plan.md`, which includes:

1. A multi-step wizard interface with progress tracking
2. Comprehensive forms for each IND preparation stage
3. AI-assisted guidance throughout the process
4. Document generation capabilities
5. Integration with existing components

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18+ (TSX/JSX), shadcn components, TailwindCSS
- **State Management:** React Context/Query with server state
- **Backend:** Express + FastAPI
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Security:** AES-256 encryption, CSRF protection
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API integration

## Key Files & Recommendations

The implementation plan includes starter code for:

1. `IndWizardLayout.jsx` - Main wizard container component
2. `PreIndStep.jsx` - First step implementation
3. `INDWizard.jsx` - Page component with routing

We recommend following our wizard architecture pattern with React Context for state management and a tab-based interface within each major step.

## Development Priorities

1. Implement the wizard framework with navigation and progress tracking
2. Build the first step (Pre-IND Planning) with comprehensive forms
3. Develop the remaining steps following the same pattern
4. Integrate AI assistance throughout the workflow
5. Connect to backend APIs for data persistence

## Expected Timeline

Given the scope of the project, we anticipate:
- 2-3 weeks for complete wizard framework implementation
- 1-2 weeks per major step component (7 steps total)
- 1-2 weeks for integration and testing

## Communication & Collaboration

We're available to provide additional context and answer questions throughout the development process. Please reach out with any questions about regulatory requirements, desired functionality, or technical implementation details.
