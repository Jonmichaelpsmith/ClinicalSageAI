STRUCTURE AND CONTENT OF CLINICAL STUDY REPORTS  
INTRODUCTION TO THE GUIDELINE 
 
The objective of this guideline is to allow th e compilation of a single core clinical study 
report acceptable to all regulatory authoriti es of the ICH regions.  The regulatory 
authority specific additions will consist of modules to be considered as appendices, 
available upon request according to regional regulatory requirements. 
The clinical study report described in this guideline is an "integrated" full report of an 
individual study of any therapeutic, prop hylactic or diagnostic agent (referred to 
herein as drug or treatment) conducted in patients, in which the clinical and 
statistical description, presentations, and analyses are integrated into a single report, 
incorporating tables and figures into the main text of the report, or at the end of the text, and with appendices containing th e protocol, sample case report forms, 
investigator related information, information related to the test drugs/investigational products including active control/comparat ors, technical statistical documentation, 
related publications, patient data listings, and technical statistical details such as 
derivations, computations, analyses, and comp uter output etc.  The integrated full 
report of a study should not be derived by  simply joining a separate clinical and 
statistical report.  Although this guidelin e is mainly aimed at efficacy and safety 
trials, the basic principles and structure de scribed can be applied to other kinds of 
trials, such as clinical pharmacology studies.  Depending on the nature and importance of such studies, a less detailed report might be appropriate. 
The guideline is intended to assist sponso rs in the development of a report that is 
complete, free from ambiguity, well organise d and easy to review.  The report should 
provide a clear explanation of how the critical design features of the study were chosen and enough information on the plan, methods and conduct of the study so that there is no ambiguity in how the study was carried out.  The report with its 
appendices should also provide enough individual patient data, including the demographic and baseline data, and details of  analytical methods, to allow replication 
of the critical analyses when authorities wish to do so.  It is also particularly important that all analyses, tables, and figures carry, in text or as part of the table, clear identification of the set of pati ents from which they were generated. 
Depending on the regulatory authority's review policy, abbreviated reports using summarised data or with some sections deleted, may be acceptable for uncontrolled 
studies or other studies not designed to es tablish efficacy (but a controlled safety 
study should be reported in full), for seriously flawed or aborted studies, or for controlled studies that examine conditions cl early unrelated to those for which a claim 
is made.  However, a full description of safety aspects should be included in these cases.  If an abbreviated report is submitted, there should be enough detail of design and results to allow the regulatory authority to determine whether a full report is needed.  If there is any question regarding whether the reports are needed, it may be 
useful to consult the regulatory authority. 
In presenting the detailed description of how the study was carried out, it may be possible simply to restate the description in th e initial protocol.  Often, however, it is 
possible to present the methodology of th e study more concisely in a separate 
document.  In each section describing the design and conduct of the study, it is 
particularly important to clarify features of the study that are not well-described in 
1 
Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports 
the protocol and identify ways in which the study as conducted differed from the 
protocol, and to discuss the statistical meth ods and analyses used to account for these 
deviations from the planned protocol. 
The full integrated report of the individual study should include the most detailed 
discussion of individual adverse events or  laboratory abnormalities, but these should 
usually be reexamined as part of an overall sa fety analysis of all available data in any 
application.   
The report should describe demographi c and other potentially predictive 
characteristics of the study population and, where the study is large enough to permit this, present data for demographic (e.g., age,  sex, race, weight) and other (e.g., renal 
or hepatic function) subgroups so that possible differences in efficacy or safety can be identified.  Usually, however, subgroup resp onses should be examined in the larger 
database used in the overall analysis. 
The data listings requested as part of the report (usually in an appendix) are those needed to support critical analyses.  Data listings that are part of the report should be readily usable by the reviewer.  Thus, althou gh it may be desirable to include many 
variables in a single listing to limit size, this  should not be at the expense of clarity.  
An excess of data should not be allowed to lead to overuse of symbols instead of words or easily understood abbreviations or to too small displays etc.  In this case, it is preferable to produce several listings. 
Data should be presented in the report at different levels of detail: overall summary 
figures and tables for important demographi c, efficacy and safety variables may be 
placed in the text to illustrate important points; other summary figures, tables and 
listings for demographic, efficacy and safety  variables should be provided in section 
14; individual patient data for specified groups of patients should be provided as listings in Appendix 16.2; and all individual patient data (archival listings requested only in the US) should be provided in Appendix 16.4. 
In any table, figure or data listing, estimated or derived values, if used, should be identified in a conspicuous fashion.  Detailed explanations should be provided as to how such values were estimated or deri ved and what underlying assumptions were 
made. 
The guidance provided below is detailed and is intended to notify the applicant of virtually all of the information that shou ld routinely be provided so that post-
submission requests for further data clar ification and analyses can be reduced as 
much as possible.  Nonetheless, specific requirements for data presentation and/ or 
analysis may depend on specific situations, may evolve over time, may vary from drug 
class to drug class, may differ among re gions and cannot be described in general 
terms; it is therefore important to refer to specific clinical guidelines and to discuss 
data presentation and analyses with the reviewing authority, whenever possible.  
Detailed written guidance on statistical approaches is available from some authorities. 
Each report should consider all of the topi cs described (unless clearly not relevant) 
although the specific sequence and grouping of topics may be changed if alternatives 
are more logical for a particular study.  Some data in the appendices are specific requirements of individual regulatory aut horities and should be submitted as 
appropriate.  The numbering should then be adapted accordingly. 
2 
Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports 
In the case of very large trials, some of the provisions of this guideline may be 
impractical or inappropriate.  When planning  and when reporting such trials, contact 
with regulatory authorities to discuss an appropriate report format is encouraged. 
The provisions of this guideline should be used in conjunction with other ICH guidelines.

Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports 
a) Investigators 
b) Any other person carrying out obse rvations of primary or other major 
efficacy variables, such as a nurse, physician's assistant, clinical 
psychologist, clinical pharmacist, or house staff physician.  It is not 
necessary to include in this list a pers on with only an occasional role, e.g., 
an on-call physician who dealt with a possible adverse effect or a temporary substitute for any of the above 
c) The author(s) of the report, including the responsible biostatistician(s). 
Where signatures of the principal or c oordinating investigators are required by 
regulatory authorities, these should be included in appendix 16.1.5 (see Annex II for a sample form).  Where these are not required, the signature of the sponsor’s responsible medical officer should be provided in appendix 16.1.5. 
7. INTRODUCTION 
The introduction should contain a brief statement (maximum: 1 page) placing the study in the context of the development of the test drug/investigational product, relating the critical features of the study (e.g., rationale and aims, target population, treatment, duration, primary endpoints) to t hat development.  Any guidelines that 
were followed in the development of the pr otocol or any other agreements/meetings 
between the sponsor/company and regulatory  authorities that are relevant to the 
particular study, should be identified or described. 
8. STUDY OBJECTIVES 
A statement describing the overall purpose(s) of the study should be provided.   
9. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
9.1 OVERALL STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN - DESCRIPTION 
The overall study plan and design (configuration) of the study (e.g., parallel, cross-over) should be described briefly but clearly,  using charts and diagrams as needed.  If 
other studies used a very similar protocol, it  may be useful to note this and describe 
any important differences.  The actual protoc ol and any changes should be included as 
appendix 16.1.1 and a sample case report fo rm (unique pages only; i.e., it is not 
necessary to include identical pages from fo rms for different evaluations or visits) as 
appendix 16.1.2.  If any of the information in this section comes from sources other than the protocol, these should be identified. 
The information provided should include: 
− treatments studied (specific drugs, doses and procedures); 
− patient population studied and the number of patients to be included; 
− level and method of blinding/masking (e.g., open, double-blind, single-blind, 
blinded evaluators and unblinded patients and/or investigators); 
− kind of control(s) (e.g., placebo, no treatment, active drug, dose-response, 
historical) and study configur ation (parallel, cross-over); 
− method of assignment to treatment (randomisation, stratification); 
− sequence and duration of all study periods, including pre-randomisation and 
post-treatment periods, therapy with drawal periods and single- and double-
blind treatment periods.  When patients are randomised should be specified.  
5 
Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports 
It is usually helpful to display the design graphically with a flow chart which 
includes timing of assessments (see Annexes IIIa and IIIb for an example); 
− any safety, data monitoring or spec ial steering or evaluation committees; 
− any interim analyses. 
9.2 DISCUSSION OF STUDY DESIGN, INCLUDING THE CHOICE OF 
CONTROL GROUPS 
The specific control chosen and the study design used should be discussed, as necessary.  Examples of design issues meriting discussion follow. 
Generally, the control (comparison) groups t hat are recognised are placebo concurrent 
control, no treatment concurre nt control, active treatment  concurrent control, dose 
comparison concurrent control, and historical  control.  In addition to the type of 
control, other critical design features that may need discussion are use of a cross-over 
design and selection of patients with particu lar prior history, such as response or non-
response to a specific drug or member of a drug class.  If randomisation was not used, 
it is important to explain how other techniques, if any, guarded against systematic selection bias. 
Known or potential problems associated wi th the study design or control group 
chosen, should be discussed in light of the specific disease and therapies being studied.  For a crossover design, for exampl e, there should be consideration, among 
other things, of the likelihood of spontan eous change in the disease and of carry-over 
effects of treatment during the study. 
If efficacy was to be demonstrated by sh owing equivalence, i.e., the absence of a 
specified degree of inferiority of the ne w treatment compared to an established 
treatment, problems associated with such  study designs should be addressed.  
Specifically there should be provided a basis for considering the study capable of 
distinguishing active from inactive therap y.  Support may be provided by an analysis 
of previous studies similar to the presen t study with respect to important design 
characteristics (patient selection, study endpoints, duration, dose of active control, concomitant therapy etc.) showing a consiste nt ability to demonstrate superiority of 
the active control to placebo.  How to assess the ability of the present study to 
distinguish effective from ineffective therapy should also be discussed.  For example, 
it may be possible to identify a treatment re sponse (based on past studies) that would 
clearly distinguish between the treated popu lation and an untreated group.  Such a 
response could be the change of a measur e from baseline or some other specified 
outcome like healing rate or survival rate .  Attainment of such a response would 
support the expectation that the study could have distinguished the active drug from 
an inactive drug.  There should also be a discussion of the degree of inferiority of the therapy (often referred to as the delta valu e) the study was intended to show was not 
exceeded. 
The limitations of historical controls are well known (difficulty of assuring 
comparability of treated groups, inability to  blind investigators to treatment, change 
in therapy/disease, difference due to pl acebo effect etc.) and deserve particular 
attention.   
Other specific features of the design may also deserve discussion, including presence 
or absence of washout periods and the durati on of the treatment period, especially for 
a chronic illness.  The rationale for dose and dose-interval selection should be explained, if it is not obvious.  For exam ple, once daily dosing with a short half-life 
6 
Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports 
drug whose effect is closely related in time to  blood level is not usually effective; if the 
study design uses such dosing, this shou ld be explained, e.g., by pointing to 
pharmacodynamic evidence that effect is pr olonged compared to blood levels.  The 
procedures used to seek evidence of "escap e" from drug effect at the end of the dose-
interval, such as measurements of effect just  prior to dosing, should be described.  
Similarly, in a parallel design dose-response study, the choice of doses should be 
explained. 
9.3 SELECTION OF STUDY POPULATION 
9.3.1 Inclusion Criteria 
The patient population and the selection criteria used to enter the patients into the study should be described, and the suitability of the population for the purposes of the study discussed.  Specific diagnostic cri teria used, as well as specific disease 
requirements (e.g., disease of a particular seve rity or duration, results of a particular 
test or rating scale(s) or physical examinat ion, particular features of clinical history, 
such as failure or success on prior therapy,  or other potential prognostic factors and 
any age, sex or ethnic factors) should be presented. 
Screening criteria and any additional criteria for randomisation or entry into the test 
drug/investigational product treatment part of the trial should be described.  If there 
is reason to believe that there were addi tional entry criteria, not defined in the 
protocol, the implications of these shou ld be discussed.  For example, some 
investigators may have excluded, or entered into other studies, patients who were 
particularly ill or who had particular baseline characteristics.  
9.3.2 Exclusion Criteria 
The criteria for exclusion at entry into the study should be specified and the rationale 
(e.g., safety concerns, administrative reasons or lack of suitability for the trial) provided.  The impact of exclusions on the generalisability of the study should be discussed in section 13 of the study report, or in an overview of safety and efficacy. 
9.3.3 Removal of Patients from Therapy or Assessment 
The predetermined reasons for removing patients from therapy or assessment observation, if any, should be described, as should the nature and duration of any planned follow-up observations in those patients. 
9.4 TREATMENTS 
9.4.1 Treatments Administered 
The precise treatments or diagnostic agents to be administered in each arm of the 
study, and for each period of the study, sh ould be described including route and mode 
of administration, dose and dosage schedule. 
9.4.2 Identity of Investigational Product(s) 
In the text of the report, a brief descri ption of the test drug(s)/investigational 
product(s) (formulation, strength, batch numbe r(s)) should be given.  If more than one 
batch of test drug/investigational produ ct was used, patients receiving each batch 
should be identified in appendix 16.1.6. 
The source of placebos and active control/co mparator product(s) should be provided.  
Any modification of comparator product(s) from their usual commercial state should 
7 
Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports 
be noted, and the steps taken to assure t hat their bioavailability was unaltered should 
be described. 
For long-duration trials of investigational  products with limited shelf-lives or 
incomplete stability data, the logistics of resupply of the materials should be 
described.  Any use of test materials past  their expiry date should be noted, and 
patients receiving them identified.  If ther e were specific storage requirements, these 
should also be described. 
9.4.3 Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups 
The specific methods used to assign patien ts to treatment groups, e.g., centralised 
allocation, allocation within sites, adaptive allocation (that is, assignment on the basis of earlier assignment or outcome) should be described in the text of the report, including any stratification or blocking pr ocedures.  Any unusual features should be 
explained. 
A detailed description of the randomisatio n method, including how it was executed, 
should be given in appendix 16.1.7 with references cited if necessary.  A table 
exhibiting the randomisation codes, patient identifier, and treatment assigned should 
also be presented in the appendix.  For a multicentre study, the information should be given by centre.  The method of generati ng random numbers should be explained. 
For a historically controlled trial, it is im portant to explain how the particular control 
was selected and what other historical experiences were examined, if any, and how their results compared to the control used.   
9.4.4 Selection of Doses in the Study 
The doses or dose ranges used in the study should be given for all treatments and the basis for choosing them described (e.g., pr ior experience in humans, animal data). 
9.4.5 Selection and Timing of Dose for each Patient 
Procedures for selecting each patient's dose  of test drug/investigational product and 
active control/comparator should be described.  These procedures can vary from simple random assignment to a selected fi xed drug/dose regimen, to some specified 
titration procedure, to more elaborate resp onse-determined selection procedures, e.g., 
where dose is titrated upward at interv als until intolerance or some specified 
endpoint is achieved.  Procedures for back-ti tration, if any, should also be described. 
The timing (time of day, interval) of dosing and the relation of dosing to meals should be described, and if it was not specified, this should be noted. 
Any specific instructions to patients about wh en or how to take the dose(s) should be 
described. 
9.4.6 Blinding 
A description of the specific procedures used  to carry out blinding should be provided 
(e.g., how bottles were labelled, labels t hat reveal blind-breakage, sealed code 
list/envelopes, double dummy techniques), in cluding the circumstances in which the 
blind would be broken for an individual or for all patients, e.g., for serious adverse 
events, the procedures used and who had access to patient codes.  If the study allowed for some investigators to remain unblinded (e .g., to allow them to adjust medication), 
the means of shielding other investigators sh ould be explained.  Measures taken to 
ensure that test drug/investigational pr oduct and placebo were indistinguishable and 
8 
Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports 
evidence that they were indistinguishable, should be described, as should the 
appearance, shape, smell, and taste of the test material.  Measures to prevent unblinding by laboratory measurements, if used, should be described.  If there was a data monitoring committee with access to  unblinded data, procedures to ensure 
maintenance of overall study blinding shou ld be described.  The procedure to 
maintain the blinding when interim analyses are performed should also be explained. 
If blinding was considered unnecessary to reduce bias for some or all of the observations, this should be explained; e.g., use of a random-zero sphygmomanometer 
eliminates possible observer bias in readin g blood pressure and Holter tapes are often 
read by automated systems that  are presumably immune to observer bias.  If blinding 
was considered desirable but not feasible, the reasons and implications should be 
discussed.  Sometimes blinding is attempte d but is known to be imperfect because of 
obvious drug effects in at least some patients  (dry mouth, bradycardia, fever, injection 
site reactions, changes in laboratory data ).  Such problems or potential problems 
should be identified and if there were any attempts to assess the magnitude of the problem or manage it (e.g., by having some endpoint measurements carried out by people shielded from information that mi ght reveal treatment assignment), they 
should be described. 
9.4.7 Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
Which drugs or procedures were allowed be fore and during the study, whether and 
how their use was recorded, and any other sp ecific rules and procedures related to 
permitted or forbidden concomitant therap y should be described.  How allowed 
concomitant therapy might affect the outcome due either to drug-drug interaction or 
to direct effects on the study endpoints shou ld be discussed, and how the independent 
effects of concomitant and study therapies co uld be ascertained should be explained. 
9.4.8 Treatment Compliance 
The measures taken to ensure and document treatment compliance should be described, e.g., drug accountability, diary ca rds, blood, urine or other body fluid drug 
level measurements, or medication event monitoring. 
9.5 EFFICACY AND SAFETY VARIABLES 
9.5.1 Efficacy and Safety Measurements Assessed and Flow Chart 
The specific efficacy and safety variables to be assessed and laboratory tests to be 
conducted, their schedule (days of study, time  of day, relation to meals, and the timing 
of critical measures in relation to test dr ug administration, e.g., just prior to next 
dose, two hours after dose), the methods for measuring them, and the persons responsible for the measurements should be described.  If there were changes in personnel carrying out critical measur ements, these should be reported. 
It is usually helpful to display graphica lly in a flow chart (see Annex III of the 
guideline) the frequency and timing of efficacy and safety measurements; visit 
numbers and times should be shown, or, alternatively, times alone can be used (visit numbers alone are more difficult to inte rpret).  Any specific instructions (e.g., 
guidance or use of a diary) to the patients should also be noted. 
Any definitions used to characterise outcome (e.g., criteria for determining occurrence of acute myocardial infarction, designation of the location of the infarction, characterisation of a stroke as thrombot ic or haemorrhagic, distinction between TIA 
9 
Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports 
and stroke, assignment of cause of death) sh ould be explained in full.  Any techniques 
used to standardise or compare results of laboratory tests or other clinical 
measurements (e.g., ECG, chest X-ray) should also be described.  This is particularly 
important in multicentre studies. 
If anyone other than the investigator was responsible for evaluation of clinical 
outcomes (e.g., the sponsor or an external co mmittee to review X-rays or ECG's or to 
determine whether the patient had a stroke , acute infarction, or sudden death) the 
person or group should be identified.  Th e procedures, including means of maintaining 
blindness, and centralising readings and measurements, should be described fully. 
The means of obtaining adverse event data should be described (volunteered, 
checklist, or, questioning), as should any  specific rating scale(s) used and any 
specifically planned follow-up procedures for adverse events or any planned rechallenge procedure.   
Any rating of adverse events by the invest igator, sponsor or external group, (e.g., 
rating by severity or, likelihood of drug c ausation) should be described.  The criteria 
for such ratings, if any, should be given and the parties responsible for the ratings should be clearly identified.   If efficacy or safety was to be assessed in terms of categorical ratings, numerical scores etc., the criteria used for point assignment (e.g., 
definitions of point scores) should be provid ed.  For multicentre studies, indicate how 
methods were standardised. 
9.5.2 Appropriateness of Measurements 
If any of the efficacy or safety assessment s was not standard, i.e., widely used and 
generally recognised as reliable, accurate, and relevant (able to discriminate between 
effective and ineffective agents), its reli ability, accuracy and relevance should be 
documented.  It may be helpful to describe alternatives considered but rejected. 
If a surrogate end point (a laboratory measurement or physical measurement or sign that is not a direct measure of clinical bene fit) was used as a study end point, this 
should be justified e.g., by reference to clinical data, publications, guidelines or previous actions by regulatory authorities. 
9.5.3 Primary Efficacy Variable(s) 
The primary measurements and endpoints used to determine efficacy should be clearly specified.  Although the critical efficacy measurements may seem obvious, 
when there are multiple variables, or when  variables are measured repeatedly, the 
protocol should identify the primary on es, with an explanation of why they were 
chosen, or designate the pattern of significant findings or other method of combining information that would be interpreted as supp orting efficacy.  If the protocol did not 
identify the primary variables, the study report should explain how these critical 
variables were selected (e.g., by reference to publications, guidelines or previous 
actions by regulatory authorities) and when they were identified (i.e., before or after the study was completed and unblinded).  If an efficacy threshold was defined in the 
protocol, this should be described. 
9.5.4 Drug Concentration Measurements 
Any drug concentrations to be measured, and  the sample collection times and periods 
in relation to the timing of drug administration, should be described.  Any relation of 
drug administration and sampling to ingestion of food, posture and the possible 
10 
Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports 
effects of concomitant medication/alcohol/caffe ine/nicotine should also be addressed.  
The biological sample measured the handling of samples and the method of 
measurement used should be described, re ferring to published and/or internal assay 
validation documentation for methodological details.  Where other factors are believed 
important in assessing pharmacokinetics (e.g., soluble circulating receptors, renal or hepatic function), the timing and plans to  measure these factors should also be 
specified.   
9.6 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE  
The quality assurance and quality control systems implemented to assure the quality of the data should be described in brief.  If none were used, this should be stated.  Documentation of inter-laboratory stand ardisation methods and quality assurance 
procedures, if used, should be provided under appendix 16.1.10. 
Any steps taken at the investigation site or  centrally to ensure the use of standard 
terminology and the collection of accurate , consistent, complete, and reliable data, 
such as training sessions, monitoring of investigators by sponsor personnel, instruction manuals, data verification, cross- checking, use of a central laboratory for 
certain tests, centralised ECG reading, or data  audits, should be described.  It should 
be noted whether investigator meetings or other steps were taken to prepare investigators and standardise performance. 
If the sponsor used an independent internal or external auditing procedure, it should 
be mentioned here and described in appe ndix 16.1.8; and audit certificates, if 
available, should be provided in the same appendix. 
9.7 STATISTICAL METHODS PLANNED IN THE PROTOCOL AND 
DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
9.7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans 
The statistical analyses planned in the protocol and any changes made before outcome results were available should be described.  In this section emphasis should be on which analyses, comparisons and statistical tests were planned, not on which ones were actually used.  If critical measur ements were made more than once, the 
particular measurements (e.g., average of several measurements over the entire study, values at particular times, values only from study completers, or last on-therapy value) planned as the basis for co mparison of test drug/investigational 
product and control should be specified.  Similarly, if more than one analytical approach is plausible, e.g., changes from baseline response, slope analysis, life table 
analysis, the planned approach should be identified.  Also, whether the primary analysis is to include adjustment for covariates should be specified. 
If there were any planned reasons for exclud ing from analysis patients for whom data 
are available, these should be described.  If there were any subgroups whose results were to be examined separately, these should  be identified.  If categorical responses 
(global scales, severity scores, responses of a certain size) were to be used in analysing 
responses, they should be clearly defined. 
Planned monitoring of the results of the study should be described.  If there was a data monitoring committee, either within  or outside the sponsor's control, its 
composition and operating proc edures should be described and procedures to maintain 
study blinding should be given.  The frequency and nature of any planned interim analysis, any specified circumstances in whic h the study would be terminated and any 
11 
Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports 
statistical adjustments to be employed because of interim analyses should be 
described. 
9.7.2 Determination of Sample Size 
The planned sample size and the basis for it, such as statistical considerations or practical limitations, should be provided.  Methods for sample size calculation should 
be given together with their derivations or source of reference.  Estimates used in the calculations should be given and explanations provided as to how they were obtained.  For a study intended to show a differenc e between treatments, the difference the 
study is designed to detect should be specif ied.  For a positive control study intended 
to show that a new therapy is at least as effective as the standard therapy, the sample 
size determination should specify the di fference between treatments that would be 
considered unacceptably large and therefore th e difference the study is designed to be 
able to exclude. 
9.8 CHANGES IN THE CONDUCT OF THE STUDY OR PLANNED 
ANALYSES 
Any change in the conduct of the study or planned analyses (e.g., dropping a treatment group, changing the entry criteria or drug dosages, adjusting the sample 
size etc.) instituted after the start of the study should be described.  The time(s) and 
reason(s) for the change(s), the procedure used to decide on the change(s), the 
person(s) or group(s) responsible for the change(s) and the nature and content of the 
data available (and to whom they were available) when the change was made should also be described, whether the change was documented as a formal protocol amendment or not (Personnel changes need not be included).  Any possible implications of the change(s) for the interpretation of the study should be discussed briefly in this section and more fully in ot her appropriate sections of the report.  In 
every section of the report, a clear dist inction between conditions (procedures) 
planned in the protocol and amendments or additions should be made.  In general, changes in planned analyses made prior to breaking the blind have limited implications for study interpretation.  It is therefore particularly critical that the timing of changes relative to blind breaki ng and availability of outcome results be 
well characterised. 
10. STUDY PATIENTS 
10.1 DISPOSITION OF PATIENTS 
There should be a clear accounting of all pa tients who entered the study, using figures 
or tables in the text of the report.  The numbers of patients who were randomised, and who entered and completed each phase of the study, (or each week/month of the study) should be provided, as well as  the reasons for all post-randomisation 
discontinuations, grouped by treatment and by major reason (lost to follow-up, adverse event, poor compliance etc.).  It ma y also be relevant to provide the number of 
patients screened for inclusion and a breakdown of the reasons for excluding patients during screening, if this could help clar ify the appropriate patient population for 
eventual drug use.  A flow chart is often helpful (see Annexes IVa and IVb of the guideline for example).  Whether patients ar e followed for the duration of the study, 
even if drug is discontinued, should be made clear. 
In appendix 16.2.1, there should also be a listing of all patients discontinued from the study after enrolment, broken down by cen tre and treatment group, giving a patient 
identifier, the specific reason for discon tinuation, the treatment (drug and dose), 
12 
Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports 
cumulative dose, (where appropriate), and the duration of treatment before 
discontinuation.  Whether or not the blind for the patient was broken at the time of 
discontinuation should be noted.  It may also  be useful to include other information, 
such as critical demographic data (e.g., age,  sex, race), concomitant medication, and 
the major response variable(s) at terminatio n.  See Annex V for an example of such a 
listing. 
10.2 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS 
All important deviations related to study incl usion or exclusion criteria, conduct of the 
trial, patient management or patient assessment should be described.   
In the body of the text, protocol deviatio ns should be appropriately summarised by 
centre and grouped into diffe rent categories, such as: 
− those who entered the study even though they did not satisfy the entry 
criteria; 
− those who developed withdrawal crite ria during the study but were not 
withdrawn; 
− those who received the wrong treatment or incorrect dose; 
− those who received an excluded concomitant treatment. 
In appendix 16.2.2, individual patients with these protocol deviations should be listed, broken down by centre for multicentre studies. 
11. EFFICACY EVALUATION 
11.1 DATA SETS ANALYSED 
Exactly which patients were included in ea ch efficacy analysis should be precisely 
defined, e.g., all patients receiving any test drugs/investigational products, all patients with any efficacy observatio n or with a certain minimum number of 
observations, only patients completing th e trial, all patients with an observation 
during a particular time window, only pati ents with a specified degree of compliance 
etc.  It should be clear, if not defined in  the study protocol, when, (relative to study 
unblinding), and how inclusion/exclusion cri teria for the data sets analysed were 
developed.  Generally, even if the applicant 's proposed primary analysis is based on a 
reduced subset of the patients with data, ther e should also be for any trial intended to 
establish efficacy an additional analysis us ing all randomised (or otherwise entered) 
patients with any on-treatment data. 
There should be a tabular listing of all pati ents, visits and observations excluded from 
the efficacy analysis provided in appendix 16.2.3 (see Annex VI of the guideline for an example). The reasons for exclusions should  also be analysed for the whole treatment 
group over time (see Annex VII of the guideline for an example). 
11.2 DEMOGRAPHIC AND OTHER BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS 
Group data for the critical demographic and baseline characteristics of the patients, 
as well as other factors arising during the study that could affect response, should be 
presented in this section and comparability of the treatment groups for all relevant characteristics should be displayed by use of  tables or graphs in section 14.1.  The 
data for the patient sample included in the "all patients with data" analysis should be 
given first.  This can then be followed by  data on other groups used in principal 
analyses, such as the "per-protocol" analysis or other analyses, e.g., groups defined by 
compliance, concomitant disease/therapy, or  demographic/baseline characteristics.  
13 
Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports 
When such groups are used, data for the complementary excluded group should also 
be shown.  In a multicentre study wher e appropriate, comparability should be 
assessed by centre, and centres should be compared.   
A diagram showing the relationship between the entire sample and any other analysis groups should be provided. 
The critical variables will depend on the specific nature of the disease and on the protocol but will usually include: 
¾ demographic variables 
− age 
− sex 
− race 
¾ disease factors  
− specific entry criteria (if not uniform ), duration, stage and severity of 
disease and other clinical classifications and sub-groupings in common usage or of known prognostic significance 
− baseline values for critical clinical measurements carried out during the 
study or identified as important indi cators of prognosis or response to 
therapy 
− concomitant illness at trial initiation, such as renal disease, diabetes, 
heart failure 
− relevant previous illness 
− relevant previous treatment for illness treated in the study  
− concomitant treatment maintained, even  if the dose was changed during 
the study, including oral contraceptive and hormone replacement therapy; treatments stopped at entry in to the study period (or changed at 
study initiation)  
¾ other factors that might affect response to therapy (e.g., weight, renin status, 
antibody levels, metabolic status) 
¾ other possibly relevant variables (e.g., sm oking, alcohol intake, special diets) 
and, for women, menstrual status and date of last menstrual period, if pertinent for the study. 
In addition to tables and graphs giving group data for these baseline variables, relevant individual patient demographic and baseline data, including laboratory 
values, and all concomitant medication for a ll individual patients randomised (broken 
down by treatment and by centre for multic entre studies) should be presented in by-
patient tabular listings in appendix 16.2.4.  Although some regulatory authorities will 
require all baseline data to be presented else where in tabular listings, the appendix to 
the study report should be limited to only  the most relevant data, generally the 
variables listed above. 
14 
Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports 
11.3 MEASUREMENTS OF TREATMENT COMPLIANCE 
Any measurements of compliance of individ ual patients with the treatment regimen 
under study and drug concentrations in body  fluids should be summarised, analysed 
by treatment group and time interval , and tabulated in Appendix 16.2.5. 
11.4 EFFICACY RESULTS AND TABULATIONS OF INDIVIDUAL PATIENT 
DATA 
11.4.1 Analysis of Efficacy 
Treatment groups should be compared for a ll critical measures of efficacy (primary 
and secondary end-points; any pharmacodynamic end points studied), as well as 
benefit/risk assessment(s) in each patient where these are utilised.  In general, the results of all analyses contemplated in the protocol and an analysis including all patients with on-study data should be performed in studies intended to establish efficacy.  The analysis should show the size (point estimate) of the difference between the treatments, the associated confidence interval, and where utilised, the results of hypothesis testing. 
Analyses based on continuous variables (e.g ., mean blood pressure or depression scale 
score) and categorical responses (e.g., cu re of an infection) can be equally valid; 
ordinarily both should be presented if both were planned and are available.  If categories are newly created, (i.e., not in the statistical plan) the basis for them 
should be explained.  Even if one variable receives primary attention (e.g., in a blood 
pressure study, supine blood pressure at  week x), other reasonable measures (e.g., 
standing blood pressure and blood pressure s at other particular times) should be 
assessed, at least briefly.  In addition, the time course of response should be described, if possible.  For a multicentre study, where appropriate, data display and 
analysis of individual centres should be incl uded for critical variables to give a clear 
picture of the results at each site, especially the larger sites. 
If any critical measurements or assessments of efficacy or safety outcomes were made 
by more than one party (e.g., both the inve stigator and an expert committee may offer 
an opinion on whether a patient had an acute infarction), overall differences between the ratings should be shown, and each patient having disparate assessments should be identified.  The assessments used should be clear in all analyses. 
In many cases, efficacy and safety endpoints are difficult to distinguish, (e.g., deaths in a fatal disease study).  Many of the principles addressed below should be adopted for critical safety measures as well. 
11.4.2 Statistical/Analytical Issues 
The statistical analysis used should be des cribed for clinical and statistical reviewers 
in the text of the report, with detailed documentation of statistical methods (see 
section Annex IX) presented in appendix 16.1.9.  Important features of the analysis including the particular methods used, adju stments made for demographic or baseline 
measurements or concomitant therapy, handling of drop-outs and missing data, adjustments for multiple comparisons, spec ial analyses of multicentre studies, and 
adjustments for interim analyses, should be discussed.  Any changes in the analysis made after blind-breaking should be identified.   
15 
Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports 
In addition to the general discussion the following specific issues should be addressed 
(unless not applicable): 
11.4.2.1 Adjustments for Covariates 
Selection of, and adjustments for, demographic or baseline measurements, concomitant therapy, or any other covariate or prognostic factor should be explained 
in the report, and methods of adjustment, results of analyses, and supportive information (e.g., ANCOVA or Cox regression  output) should be included in the 
detailed documentation of statistical methods.  If the covariates or methods used in these analyses differed from those planned in the protocol, the differences should be explained and where possible and relevant, the results of planned analyses should also be presented.  Although not part of the individual study report, comparisons of covariate adjustments and prognostic facto rs across individual studies may be an 
informative analysis in a summary of clinical efficacy data. 
11.4.2.2 Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data 
There are several factors that may affect dropout rates.  These include the duration of the study, the nature of the disease, the effi cacy and toxicity of the drug under study, 
and other factors that are not therapy relate d.  Ignoring the patients who dropped out 
of the study and drawing conclusions based only on patients who completed the study can be misleading.  A large number of dropouts, however, even if included in an analysis, may introduce bias, particularly if there are more early dropouts in one treatment group or the reasons for dropping  out are treatment or outcome related.  
Although the effects of early dropouts, and sometimes even the direction of bias, can be difficult to determine, possible effects should be explored as fully as possible.  It may be helpful to examine the observed cases at various time points or, if dropouts 
were very frequent, to concentrate on anal yses at time points when most of the 
patients were still under observation and when the full effect of the drug was realised.  
It may also be helpful to examine modelling approaches to the evaluation of such incomplete data sets.   
The results of a clinical trial should be assessed not only for the subset of patients who completed the study, but also for the en tire patient population as randomised or 
at least for all those with any on-study me asurements.  Several factors need to be 
considered and compared for the treatment groups in analysing the effects of dropouts: the reasons for the dropouts, the time to dropout, and the proportion of dropouts among treatment groups at various time points. 
Procedures for dealing with missing data, e.g., use of estimated or derived data, 
should be described.  Detailed explanation should be provided as to how such estimations or derivations were done and  what underlying assumptions were made. 
11.4.2.3 Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring 
The process of examining and analysing data accumulating in a clinical trial, either formally or informally, can introduce bias and /or increase type I error.  Therefore, all 
interim analyses, formal or informal, pre-pl anned or ad hoc, by any study participant, 
sponsor staff member, or data monitoring group should be described in full, even if the treatment groups were not identified.  The need for statistical adjustment because of such analyses should be addressed.  Any operating instructions or procedures used for such analyses should be described.  The minutes of meetings of any data monitoring group and any data reports re viewed at those meetings, particularly a 
meeting that led to a change in the protocol or early termination of the study, may be 
16 
Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports 
helpful and should be provided in appendix  16.1.9.  Data monitoring without code-
breaking should also be described, even if this kind of monitoring is considered to 
cause no increase in type I error. 
11.4.2.4 Multicentre Studies 
A multicentre study is a single study und er a common protocol, involving several 
centres (e.g., clinics, practices, hospitals) where the data collected are intended to be 
analysed as a whole (as opposed to a post-hoc decision to combine data or results from 
separate studies).  Individual centre resu lts should be presented, however, where 
appropriate, e.g., when the centres have sufficient numbers of patients to make such analysis potentially valuable, the possibilit y of qualitative or quantitative treatment-
by-centre interaction should be explored.  Any extreme or opposite results among 
centres should be noted and discussed, cons idering such possibilities as differences in 
study conduct, patient characteristics, or clinical settings.  Treatment comparison should include analyses that allow for centre differences with respect to response.  If 
appropriate, demographic, baseline, and post -baseline data, as well as efficacy data, 
should be presented by centre, even though the combined analysis is the primary one. 
11.4.2.5 Multiple Comparison/Multiplicity 
False positive findings increase in number as the number of significance tests (number of comparisons) performed increases.  If there was more than one primary endpoint (outcome variable), more than one analysis of particular endpoint, or if there were multiple treatment groups, or subsets of the patient population being examined, the statistical analysis should reflect awareness of this and either explain the statistical adjustment used for type I e rror criteria or give reasons why it was 
considered unnecessary. 
11.4.2.6 Use of an "Efficacy Subset" of Patients 
Particular attention should be devoted to the effects of dropping patients with 
available data from analyses because of p oor compliance, missed visits, ineligibility, 
or any other reason.  As noted above, an analysis using all available data should be carried out for all studies intended to establish efficacy, even if it is not the analysis proposed as the primary analysis by the applicant.  In general, it is advantageous to demonstrate robustness of the principal trial  conclusions with respect to alternative 
choices of patient populations for analysis.  Any substantial differences resulting from 
the choice of patient population for analysis should be the subject of explicit discussion. 
11.4.2.7 Active-Control Studies Intended to Show Equivalence 
If an active control study is intended to show equivalence (i.e., lack of a difference 
greater than a specified size) between the te st drug/investigational product and the 
active control/comparator, the analysis should show the confidence interval for the comparison between the two agents for critical end points and the relation of that interval to the prespecified degree of inferiority that would be considered 
unacceptable.  (See 9.2, for important consid erations when using the active control 
equivalence design.)

If the size of the study permits, important demographic or baseline value-defined 
subgroups should be examined for unusually large or small responses and the results 
presented, e.g., comparison of effects by age,  sex, or race, by severity or prognostic 
groups, by history of prior treatment with a drug of the same class etc.  If these analyses were not carried out because the study was too small it should be noted.  These analyses are not intended to "salvage" an otherwise non-supportive study but may suggest hypotheses worth examining in other studies or be helpful in refining 
labelling information, patient selection, dose selection etc.  Where there is a prior hypothesis of a differential effect in a pa rticular subgroup, this hypothesis and its 
assessment should be part of the planned statistical analysis. 
11.4.3 Tabulation of Individual Response Data 
In addition to tables and graphs represen ting group data, individual response data 
and other relevant study information should be presented in tables.  Some regulatory 
authorities may require all individual data in archival case report tabulations.  What needs to be included in the report will vary  from study to study and from one drug 
class to another and the applicant must deci de, if possible after consultation with the 
regulatory authority, what to include in appendix to the study report.  The study 
report should indicate what material is incl uded as an appendix, what is in the more 
extensive archival case report tabulations, if required by the regulatory authority, and what is available on request.  
For a controlled study in which critical e fficacy measurements or assessments (e.g., 
blood or urine cultures, pulmonary function tests, angina frequency, or global evaluations) are repeated at intervals, the data listings accompanying the report 
should include, for each patient, a patient identifier, all measured or observed values of critical measurements, including baseline measurements, with notation of the time during the study (e.g., days on therapy and time of day, if relevant) when the measurements were made, the drug/dose at the time (if useful, given as mg/kg), any 
measurements of compliance, and any concomit ant medications at the time of, or close 
to the time of, measurement or assessment.  If, aside from repeated assessments, the study included some overall responder vs non-responder evaluation(s), (bacteriologic 
cure or failure), it should also be included .  In addition to critical measurements, the 
tabulation should note whether the patient was included in the efficacy evaluation 
(and which evaluation, if more than one), provide patient compliance information, if 
collected, and a reference to the location of the case report form, if included.  Critical 
baseline information such as age, sex, weig ht, disease being treated (if more than one 
in study), and disease stage or severity, is also helpful.  The baseline values for 
critical measurements would ordinarily be included as zero time values for each efficacy measurement.   
The tabulation described should usually be included in appendix 16.2.6 of the study report, rather than in the more extensive case report tabulations required by some 
regulatory authorities, because it represen ts the basic efficacy data supporting 
summary tables.  Such a thorough tabulat ion can be unwieldy for review purposes, 
however, and it is expected that more target ed displays will be developed as well.  For 
example, if there are many measurements reported,  tabulations of the most critical measurements for each patient (e.g., the blood pressure value at certain visits might be more important than others) will be us eful in providing an overview of each 
individual's results in a study, with each patient's response summarised on a single line or small number of lines. 
18 
Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports 
11.4.4 Drug Dose, Drug Concentration, and Relationships to Response 
When the dose in each patient can vary, the actual doses received by patients should 
be shown and individual patient's doses should be tabulated.  Although studies not designed as dose-response studies may have limited ability to contribute dose-
response information, the available da ta should be examined for whatever 
information they can yield.  In examining the dose response, it may be helpful to calculate dose as mg/kg body weig ht or mg/m² body surface.   
Drug concentration information, if avail able, should also be tabulated (Appendix 
16.2.5), analysed in pharmacokinetic terms and, if possible, related to response. 
Further guidance on the design and analysis  of studies exploring dose-response or 
concentration response can be found in the ICH Guideline "Dose-Response Information to Support Drug Registration". 
11.4.5 Drug-Drug and Drug-Disease Interactions 
Any apparent relationship between respon se and concomitant therapy and between 
response and past and/or concurrent illness should be described. 
11.4.6 By-Patient Displays 
While individual patient data ordinarily can be  displayed in tabular listings, it has on 
occasion been helpful to construct individual patient profiles in other formats, such as 
graphic displays.  These might, for example, show the value of (a) particular parameter(s) over time, the drug dose over the same period, and the times of particular events (e.g., an adverse event or  change in concomitant therapy).  Where 
group mean data represent the principal anal yses, this kind of "case report extract" 
may offer little advantage; it may be help ful, however, if overall evaluation of 
individual responses is a critical part of the analysis. 
11.4.7 Efficacy Conclusions 
The important conclusions concerning effi cacy should be concisely described, 
considering primary and secondary end points, pre-specified and alternative 
statistical approaches and results of exploratory analyses. 
12. SAFETY EVALUATION 
Analysis of safety-related data can be considered at three levels.  First, the extent of exposure (dose, duration, number of patients) should be examined to determine the degree to which safety can be assessed from  the study.  Second, the more common 
adverse events, laboratory test changes etc. should be identified, classified in some 
reasonable way, compared for treatment gr oups, and analysed, as appropriate, for 
factors that may affect the frequency of adverse reactions/events, such as time 
dependence, relation to demographic chara cteristics, relation to dose or drug 
concentration etc.  Finally, serious adve rse events and other significant adverse 
events should be identified, usually by cl ose examination of patients who left the 
study prematurely because of an adverse event, whether or not identified as drug related, or who died.   
The ICH Guideline on Clinical Safety Data Management, Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting define s serious adverse events as follows: a "serious adverse 
event" (experience) or reaction is any unt oward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, results in persis tent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
19 
Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports 
For the purpose of this guideline, "other significant adverse events" are marked 
haematological and other laboratory abnormalit ies and any adverse events that led to 
an intervention, including withdrawal of drug treatment, dose reduction or significant additional concomitant therapy. 
In the following sections, three kinds of analysis and display are called for: 
1) summarised data, often using tables and graphical presentations presented in the main body of the report 
2) listings of individual patient data, and 
3) narrative statements of events of particular interest. 
In all tabulations and analyses, events associated with both test drug and control treatment should be displayed. 
12.1 EXTENT OF EXPOSURE 
The extent of exposure to test drugs/invest igational products (and to active control 
and placebo) should be characterised accord ing to the number of patients exposed, the 
duration of exposure, and the dose to which they were exposed.   
• Duration:  Duration of exposure to any dose  can be expressed as a median or 
mean, but it is also helpful to descri be the number of patients exposed for 
specified periods of time, such as for one day or less, 2 days to one week, more than one week to one month, more than one month to 6 months etc.  The numbers exposed to test drug(s)/ investigational product(s) for the 
various durations should also be broken down into age, sex, and racial subgroups, and any other pertinent subg roups, such as disease (if more than 
one is represented), disease severity, concurrent illness. 
• Dose:  The mean or median dose used and the number of patients exposed to 
specified daily dose levels should be give n; the daily dose levels used could be 
the maximum dose for each patient, the dose with longest exposure for each 
patient, or the mean daily dose.  It is often useful to provide combined dose-duration information, such as the numbe rs exposed for a given duration (e.g., 
at least one month) to the most common dose, the highest dose, the maximum recommended dose etc.  In so me cases, cumulative dose might be 
pertinent.  Dosage may be given as the actual daily dose or on a mg/kg or 
mg/m² basis as appropriate.  The numbers of patients exposed to various doses should be broken down into age, sex, and racial subgroups, and any other pertinent subgroups. 
• Drug concentration:  If available, drug concentration data (e.g., concentration 
at the time of an event, maximum plasma concentration, area under curve) may be helpful in individual patients for correlation with adverse events or 
changes in laboratory variables.  (Appendix 16.2.5.)  
It is assumed that all patients entere d into treatment who received at least 
one dose of the treatment are included in the safety analysis; if that is not so, an explanation should be provided.

12.2 ADVERSE EVENTS (AEs) 
12.2.1 Brief Summary of Adverse Events 
The overall adverse event experience in the study should be described in a brief 
narrative, supported by the following more  detailed tabulations and analyses.  In 
these tabulations and analyses, events associat ed with both the test drug and control 
treatment should be displayed. 
12.2.2 Display of Adverse Events 
All adverse events occurring after initiation of study treatments (including events likely to be related to the underlying di sease or likely to represent concomitant 
illness, unless there is a prior agreement wi th the regulatory authority to consider 
specified events as disease related) should  be displayed in summary tables (section 
14.3.1).  The tables should include changes in vital signs and any laboratory changes 
that were considered serious adverse even ts or other significant adverse events. 
In most cases, it will also be useful to identify in such tables "treatment emergent 
signs and symptoms" (TESS; those not seen at baseline and those that worsened even if present at baseline). 
The tables should list each adverse event, the number of patients in each treatment group in whom the event occurred, and the rate of occurrence.  When treatments are 
cyclical, e.g., cancer chemotherapy, it may also be helpful to list results separately for each cycle.  Adverse events should be grou ped by body system.  Each event may then 
be divided into defined severi ty categories (e.g., mild, mode rate, severe) if these were 
used.  The tables may also divide the adverse events into those considered at least possibly related to drug use and those cons idered not related, or use some other 
causality scheme (e.g., unrelated or possibly, probably, or definitely related).  Even when such a causality assessment is used, the tables should include all adverse events, whether or not considered drug rela ted, including events thought to represent 
intercurrent illnesses.  Subsequent analyses of  the study or of the overall safety data 
base may help to distinguish between adverse events that are, or are not, considered 
drug related.  So that it is possible to anal yse and evaluate the data in these tables, it 
is important to identify each patient having each adverse event.  An example of such a tabular presentation is shown below.

**Patient identification number  
In addition to these complete tables provided in 14.3.1, an additional summary table 
comparing treatment and control groups, without the patient identifying numbers 
limited to relatively common adverse events (e.g., those in at least 1% of the treated group), should be provided in the body of the report. 
In presenting adverse events, it is important  both to display the original terms used 
by the investigator and to attempt to group related events (i.e., events that probably represent the same phenomena) so that the true occurrence rate is not obscured.  One way to do this is with a standard adverse reaction/events dictionary. 
12.2.3 Analysis of Adverse Events 
The basic display of adverse event rates de scribed in section 12.2.2 (and located in 
section 14.3.1) of the report, should be used  to compare rates in treatment and control 
groups.  For this analysis it may be helpfu l to combine the event severity categories 
and the causality categories, leading to a simpler side-by-side comparison of 
treatment groups.  In addition, although this is usually best done in an integrated analysis of safety, if study size and design  permit, it may be useful to examine the 
more common adverse events that seem to be drug related for relationship to dosage and to mg/kg or mg/m² dose, to dose regimen,  to duration of treatment, to total dose, 
to demographic characteristics such as age, sex, race, to other baseline features such 
as renal status, to efficacy outcomes, and to drug concentration.  It may also be useful 
to examine time of onset and duration of adverse events.  A variety of additional analyses may be suggested by the study results or by the pharmacology of the test drug/investigational product. 
It is not intended that every adverse event be subjected to rigorous statistical evaluation.  It may be apparent from initial display and inspection of the data that a significant relation to demographic or other baseline features is not present.  If the 
studies are small and if the number of events is relatively small, it may be sufficient to limit analyses to a comparison of treatment and control. 
22 
Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports 
Under certain circumstances, life table or si milar analyses may be more informative 
than reporting of crude adverse event rate s.  When treatments are cyclical, e.g., 
cancer chemotherapy, it may also be help ful to analyse results separately for each 
cycle. 
12.2.4 Listing of Adverse Events by Patient 
All adverse events for each patient, including the same event on several occasions 
should be listed in appendix 16.2.7, giving both preferred term and the original term used by the investigator.  The listing shou ld be by investigator and by treatment 
group and should include: 
− Patient identifier 
− Age, race, sex, weight (height, if relevant) 
− Location of CRFs, if provided 
− The adverse event (preferred term, reported term) 
− Duration of the adverse event 
− Severity (e.g., mild, moderate, severe) 
− Seriousness (serious/non-serious) 
− Action taken (none, dose reduced, tre atment stopped, specific treatment 
instituted etc.) 
− Outcome (e.g., CIOMS format) 
− Causality assessment (e.g., related/not related).  How this was determined 
should be described in the table or elsewhere 
− Date of onset or date of clinic visit at which the event was discovered 
− Timing of onset of the adverse event in relation to last dose of test 
drug/investigational product (when applicable) 
− Study treatment at time of event or most recent study treatment taken 
− Test drug/investigational product dose in absolute amount, mg/kg or mg/m² at 
time of event 
− Drug concentration (if known) 
− Duration of test drug/inves tigational product treatment 
− Concomitant treatment during study. 
Any abbreviations and codes should be clearly explained at the beginning of the listing or, preferably, on each page. 
12.3 DEATHS, OTHER SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS, AND OTHER 
SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EVENTS 
Deaths, other serious adverse events, and other significant adverse events deserve 
special attention. 
12.3.1 Listing of Deaths, other Serious Adverse Events and Other Significant 
Adverse Events 
Listings, containing the same information as  called for in section 12.2.4 above, should 
be provided for the following events. 
12.3.1.1 Deaths 
23 
Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports 
All deaths during the study, including the post treatment follow-up period, and deaths 
that resulted from a process that began duri ng the study, should be listed by patient 
in section 14.3.2. 
12.3.1.2 Other Serious Adverse Events 
All serious adverse events (other than deat h but including the serious adverse events 
temporally associated with or preceding the deaths) should be listed in section 14.3.2.  
The listing should include laboratory abnormalities, abnormal vital signs and 
abnormal physical observations that we re considered serious adverse events. 
12.3.1.3 Other Significant Adverse Events 
Marked haematological and other laboratory abnormalities (other than those meeting the definition of serious) and any events that led to an intervention, including withdrawal of test drug/investigational  product treatment, dose reduction, or 
significant additional concomitant therap y, other than those reported as serious 
adverse events, should be listed in section 14.3.2. 
12.3.2 Narratives of Deaths, Other Serious Adverse Events and Certain 
Other Significant Adverse Events 
There should be brief narratives describing each death, each other serious adverse event, and those of the other significant advers e events that are judged to be of special 
interest because of clinical importance.  Th ese narratives can be placed either in the 
text of the report or in section 14.3.3, depe nding on their number.  Events that were 
clearly unrelated to the test drug/investiga tional product may be omitted or described 
very briefly.  In general, the narra tive should describe the following: 
the nature and intensity of event, the clinic al course leading up to event, with an 
indication of timing relevant to test drug/investigational product administration; relevant laboratory measurements, whet her the drug was stopped, and when; 
countermeasures; post mortem findings; investigator's opinion on causality, and sponsor's opinion on causality, if appropriate. 
In addition, the following information should be included: 
− Patient identifier 
− Age and sex of patient; general clinical condition of patient, if appropriate 
− Disease being treated (if the same for all patients this is not required) with 
duration (of current episode) of illness 
− Relevant concomitant/previous illnesses with details of occurrence/duration 
− Relevant concomitant/previous medi cation with details of dosage 
− Test drug/investigational product admi nistered, drug dose, if this varied 
among patients, and length of time administered. 
12.3.3 Analysis and Discussion of Deat hs, Other Serious Adverse Events and 
Other Significant Adverse Events 
The significance of the deaths, other seri ous adverse events and other significant 
adverse events leading to withdrawal, dose  reduction or institution of concomitant 
therapy should be assessed with respect to th e safety of the test drug/investigational 
product.  Particular attention should be paid to whether any of these events may represent a previously unsuspected im portant adverse effect of the test 
drug/investigational product.  For serious adverse events that appear of particular 
24 
Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports 
importance, it may be useful to use life table or similar analyses to show their relation 
to time on test drug/investigational product and to assess their risk over time. 
12.4 CLINICAL LABORATORY EVALUATION 
12.4.1 Listing of Individual Laboratory Measurements by Patient (16.2.8) and 
Each Abnormal Laboratory Value (14.3.4) 
When required by regulatory authorities, the results of all safety-related laboratory 
tests should be available in tabular listings, using a display similar to the following, where each row represents a patient visit at which a laboratory study was done, with patients grouped by investigator (if more than one) and treatment group, and columns 
include critical demographic data, drug dose  data, and the results of the laboratory 
tests.  As not all tests can be displayed in  a single table, they should be grouped 
logically (haematological tests, liver chem istries, electrolytes, urinalysis etc.).  
Abnormal values should be identified, e.g., by underlining, bracketing etc.  These listings should be submitted as part of the registration/marketing application, when 
this is required, or may be available on request.

* Vn = value of a particular test 
For all regulatory authorities, there should  be a by-patient listing of all abnormal 
laboratory values in section 14.3.4, using the format described abo ve.  For laboratory 
abnormalities of special interest (abnormal laboratory values of potential clinical 
importance), it may also be useful to provide additional data, such as normal values before and after the abnormal value, and values  of related laboratory tests.  In some 
cases, it may be desirable to exclude certa in abnormal values from further analysis.  
For example, single, non-replicated, small abnormalities of some tests (e.g., uric acid or electrolytes) or occasional low values of some tests (e.g., transaminase, alkaline 
phosphatase, BUN etc.) can probably be defined as clinically insignificant and excluded.  Any such decisions should be cl early explained, however, and the complete 
list of values provided (or available to aut horities on request) should identify every 
abnormal value.  
12.4.2 Evaluation of Each Laboratory Parameter 
The necessary evaluation of laboratory valu es must in part be determined by the 
results seen, but, in general, the following analyses should be provided.  For each analysis, comparison of the treatment and control groups should be carried out, as appropriate, and as compatible with study si ze.  In addition, normal laboratory ranges 
should be given for each analysis. 
25 
Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports 
12.4.2.1 Laboratory Values Over Time 
For each parameter at each time over the co urse of the study (e.g., at each visit) the 
following should be described: the group mean or median values, the range of values, 
and the number of patients with abnormal values, or with abnormal values that are of a certain size (e.g., twice the upper limit of normal, 5 times the upper limit; choices 
should be explained).  Graphs may be used. 
12.4.2.2 Individual Patient Changes 
An analysis of individual patient changes by treatment group should be given.  A 
variety of approaches may be used, including: 
I. "Shift tables" - These tables show the number of patients who are low, normal, or high at baseline and then at selected time intervals. 
II. Tables showing the number or fraction of patients who had a change in parameter of a predetermined size at selected time in tervals.  For example, for BUN, it might 
be decided that a change of more than 10 mg/dL BUN should be noted.  For this 
parameter, the number of patients having a change less than this or greater than this would be shown for one or more visi ts, usually grouping patients separately 
depending on baseline BUN (normal or elev ated).  The possible advantage of this 
display, compared to the usual shift table,  is that changes of a certain size are 
noted, even if the final value is not abnormal. 
III. A graph comparing the initial value and the on-treatment values of a laboratory measurement for each patient by locating the point defined by the initial value on the abscissa and a subsequent value on the ordinate.  If no changes occur, the point representing each patient will be loca ted on the 45° line.  A general shift to 
higher values will show a clustering of points above the 45° line.  As this display usually shows only a single time point for a single treatment, interpretation 
requires a time series of these plot s for treatment and control groups.  
Alternatively the display could show bas eline and most extreme on-treatment 
value.  These displays identify outliers readily (it is useful to include patient identifiers for the outliers). 
12.4.2.3 Individual Clinically  Significant Abnormalities 
Clinically significant changes (defined by  the applicant) should be discussed.  A 
narrative of each patient whose laborato ry abnormality was considered a serious 
adverse event and, in certain cases, considered an other significant adverse event, should be provided under sections 12.3.2 or 14.3.3.  When toxicity grading scales are 
used (e.g., WHO, NCI), changes graded as severe should be discussed regardless of 
seriousness.  An analysis of the clinically significant changes, together with a recapitulation of discontinuations due to laboratory measurements, should be provided for each parameter.  The signific ance of the changes and likely relation to 
the treatment should be assessed, e.g., by analysis of such features as relationship to dose, relationship to drug concentration, disappearance on continued therapy, positive dechallenge, positive rechallenge, and  the nature of concomitant therapy. 
26 
Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports 
12.5 VITAL SIGNS, PHYSICAL FINDINGS AND OTHER OBSERVATIONS 
RELATED TO SAFETY  
Vital signs, other physical findings, and othe r observations related to safety should be 
analysed and presented in a way similar to l aboratory variables.  If there is evidence 
of a drug effect, any dose-response or dr ug concentration-response relationship or 
relationship to patient variables (e.g., di sease, demographics, concomitant therapy) 
should be identified and the clinical re levance of the observation described.  
Particular attention should be given to c hanges not evaluated as efficacy variables 
and to those considered to be adverse events.  
12.6 SAFETY CONCLUSIONS 
The overall safety evaluation of the test dr ug(s)/investigational product(s) should be 
reviewed, with particular attention to events resulting in changes of dose or need for 
concomitant medication, serious adverse even ts, events resulting in withdrawal, and 
deaths.  Any patients or patient groups at increased risk should be identified and 
particular attention paid to potentially vu lnerable patients who may be present in 
small numbers, e.g., children, pregnant women,  frail elderly, people with marked 
abnormalities of drug metabolism or excretion  etc.  The implication of the safety 
evaluation for the possible uses of the drug should be described. 
13. DISCUSSION AND OVERALL CONCLUSIONS 
The efficacy and safety results of the study and the relationship of risks and benefit should be briefly summarised and discussed,  referring to the tables, figures, and 
sections above as needed.  The presentation should not simply repeat the description 
of results nor introduce new results. 
The discussion and conclusions should clearly identify any new or unexpected 
findings, comment on their significance and discuss any potential problems such as inconsistencies between related measures.  The clinical relevance and importance of the results should also be discussed in the light of other existing data.  Any specific 
benefits or special precautions required for individual subjects or at-risk groups and any implications for the conduct of future st udies should be identified.  Alternatively, 
such discussions may be reserved for summarie s of safety and efficacy referring to the 
entire dossier (integrated summaries). 
14. TABLES, FIGURES AND GRAPHS REFERRED TO BUT NOT 
INCLUDED IN THE TEXT 
Figures should be used to visually summarise the important results, or to clarify results that are not easily understood from tables.  
Important demographic, efficacy and safety  data should be presented in summary 
figures or tables in the text of the report.  However, if these become obtrusive because 
of size or number they should be presente d here, cross-referenced to the text, along 
with supportive, or additional, figures, tables or listings.

GUIDANCE FOR SECTION 11.4.2  - STATISTICAL /ANALYTICAL ISSUES AND 
APPENDIX 16.1.9 
A. Statistical Considerations 
Details of the statistical analysis perfor med on each primary efficacy variable 
should be presented in an appendix.  Details reported should include at least the 
following information: 
a) The statistical model underlying the analysis.  This should be presented precisely and completely, using references if necessary. 
b) A statement of the clinical claim tested in precise statistical terms, e.g., in 
terms of null and alternative hypotheses. 
c) The statistical methods applied to es timate effects, construct confidence 
intervals etc.    Literature references  should be included where appropriate. 
d) The assumptions underlying the statistica l methods.  It should be shown, 
insofar as statistically reasonable, that the data satisfy crucial assumptions, especially when necessary to confirm the validity of an inference.  When extensive statistical analyses have been  performed by the applicant, it is 
essential to consider the extent to which the analyses were planned prior to 
the availability of data and, if they were not, how bias was avoided in choosing the particular analysis used as a basis for conclusions.  This is particularly important in the case of any subgroup analyses, because if such analyses are not preplanned they w ill ordinarily not provide an adequate 
basis for definitive conclusions. 
(i) In the event data transformation was performed, a rationale for the choice 
of data transformation along with in terpretation of the estimates of 
treatment effects based on transformed data should be provided. 
(ii) A discussion of the appropriateness of  the choice of statistical procedure 
and the validity of statistical conclusions will guide the regulatory authority's statistical reviewer in de termining whether reanalysis of data 
is needed. 
e) The test statistic, the sampling distribution of the test statistic under the 
null hypothesis, the value of the test statistic, significance level (i.e., p-value), and intermediate summary data, in a format that enables the regulatory authority's statistical reviewer  to verify the results of the analysis 
quickly and easily.  The p-values should be designated as one- or two-tailed.  
The rationale for using a one-tailed test should be provided.   
For example, the documentation of a two-sample t-test should consist of the value of the t-statistic, the associated degrees of freedom, the p-value, the two sample sizes, mean and variance for each of the samples, and the pooled estimate of variance.  The documentation of multi-centre studies analysed by analysis of variance techniques should include, at a minimum, an analysis of variance table with terms for centres, treatments, their interaction, error, 
and total.  For crossover designs, the documentation should include 
information regarding sequences, patients  within sequences, baselines at the 
40 
Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports 
start of each period, washouts and length of washouts, dropouts during each 
period, treatments, periods, treatment by period interaction, error, and total.  
For each source of variation, aside from the total, the table should contain the degrees of freedom, the sum of squares, the mean square, the appropriate F-test, the p-value, and the expected mean square. 
Intermediate summary data should display the demographic data and response data, averaged or otherwise summarised, for each centre-by-treatment combination (or other design characteristic such as sequence) at 
each observation time. 
B. Format and Specifications for Submission of Data Requested by 
Regulatory Authority's Statistical Reviewers 
In the report of each controlled clinical study, there should be data listings (tabulations) of patient data utilised by the sponsor for statistical analyses and tables supporting conclusions and major findings.  These data listings are necessary for the regulatory authority's statistical review, and the sponsor may 
be asked to supply these patient data listings in a computer-readable form.
