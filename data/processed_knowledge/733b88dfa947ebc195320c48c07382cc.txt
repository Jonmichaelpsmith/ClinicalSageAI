GUIDELINES FOR DESIGNING A CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL  
 
(based on International Conference on Harmonization, GCP Guidelines for Clinical Trial Protocol development ) 
 
 
To draft a sound scientific design of a clinical research study, the medical writer at the TGH, 
Office of Clinical Research recommends that th e following information should be included in 
a research protocol. It will help facilitate the applicatio n submission process and study 
approval from the Office of Clinical Research and IRB.  
 
Study Summary:  
 
Study summary should include the following: 
• Protocol title ( The title on related IRB submissions (e.g., applications for new study, changes in 
procedure, research progress reports) must match the title of the protocol ) 
• Study phase  
• Duration of the study 
• Methodology 
• Study site 
• Approximate number of subjects 
• Name, title, address, and telephone number of the PI, Co-PI, sponsors and study 
coordinators 
• Investigator’s affiliation 
 
List of Abbreviations: 
 
Provide a list of abbreviation used in the study protocol. 
 
Background Information/Significance:   
 
• Name and description of the investigational product, and in case of retrospective 
reviews, justification for the ch art and medical record reviews.  
• Summary of results from prior clinical studies and clinical data to date.  
• Human subjects risks and benefits.  
• Description of the population to be studied.  
• Description and justification for the dosing regimen and treatment period.  
• A paragraph stating that the clinical study will be conducted in compliance with 
the protocol, SOPs and the federa l, state and local regulations.  
• Citations from the references and data re levant to the study that also provides 
background for the trial.  
 
Objectives/Rationale/Research Question: 
 
• Include a detailed description of the primary and secondary objectives and the 
purpose of the study and clearly state your  research hypothesis or your question. 
• Discuss the project’s feasibility. 
• Give details of resources, skills and experience to complete the study. 
• Include any pilot study information. 
 
Clinical Study Design: 
 
• Primary and secondary endpoints, if any,  to be measured during the study. 
• Include the information th at is needed to answer  the research question. 
• Include the study design e.g. single, double-blind, observational, randomized, 
retrospective etc. A schematic diagram of  the study design would be helpful. 
• Include the amount of dosage, dosing  regimen of the drug, packaging and 
labeling of the ex perimental drug. 
• Explain how the study drug will  be stored and dispensed. 
• Include the expected durati on of the study and sub ject’s participation and a 
description of the sequence and duration of all study periods. 
• Include any follow up visits. 
• Describe when a subject’s participation in the trial may be discontinued. 
• Maintenance of randomization codes and confidentiality. 
• Describe the potential risks and step s taken to minimi ze the risks. 
• Identify possible benefits of the study. 
 
 
Inclusion and Exclusion cr iteria of the Subjects:   
 
• Include subjects inclusion criteria. 
• Include subjects exclusion criteria. Women of childbearing potential may not be 
routinely excluded from participating in research, however, pregnant women 
should be excluded unless there is a clear justification to include them.  
• Include enrollment of persons of diverse racial and ethnic back grounds to ensure 
that the benefits of the research study are distributed in an  equitable manner.  
 
Informed consent form process: 
 
• Provide information about the regulatory re quirements of the consent form and which 
languages will be used. 
• Include a discussion of additional safeguards taken if potentially vulnerable subjects will be 
enrolled in the study e.g., children, prisoners, cognitively impaired and critically ill subjects.   
• Specify Code of Ethics under which consent will be obtained. 
• Include a copy of the proposed informed consent along with the protocol. 
 
Adverse Event Reporting: 
 
• Describe your plan to report any adverse event.  
• Anticipated adverse events shou ld be clearly documented.  
• Identify the type and duration of follow up and treatment for subjects that 
experience an adverse event. 
 
Assessment of Safety and Efficacy: 
 
• Be specific about the efficacy parameters.  
• Include the methods and timing for assessi ng, recording, and analyzing efficacy 
parameters.  
• Specify the safety parameters.  
• Record and report properly all the ad verse events and inter current illnesses.  
 
Treatment of Subjects: 
 
• List all the treatments to be administer ed including product’s name, dose, route 
of administration, and the treatment period for subjects.  
• Include all medication pe rmitted before and during the clinical trial. 
• Include the procedures for mo nitoring subject compliance.  
 
Data Collection Plan: 
 
• Define the type of data collection instrument that will be used and list all the 
variables.  
• Specify if computerized databases will be used.  
• Identify what software will be used.  
• Explain precautionary steps taken to secure the data.  
 
Data Access:  
• Inform who will have access to the data and how the data will be used. If data 
with subject identifiers will  be released, specify the person(s) or agency to whom 
the information will be released and the purpose of the release. 
• Address all study related monitoring, au dits, and regulatory inspections.  
 
Statistical Methods:  
• Describe the statistical methods in detail.  
• Include the number of subjects you are planning to enroll. For multi-center 
studies, include the total number of si tes expected and the total number of 
subjects to be enrolled across all sites.  
• Provide the rationale for the sample size , the calculations on  the power of the 
trial and the clinical justification.  
• Procedure of accounting for mi ssing, unused and spurious data.  
• Procedures for reporting deviations from the original statistical plan.  
• Include the selections of subjects to be included in the analyses.  
 
Conflict of Interest:

investigators has with a non-USF entity related to the protocol that might be considered a 
real or apparent conflict of interest. 
 
Publication and Presentation Plans:  
 
List any meetings or conference  you will be presenting the data and the results of your 
study. 
 
Timeline: 
 
• A short paragraph stating when you plan  to start and complete the study. 
• Include a description e.g. subjects enrollment within a month, data collection 
within 6 months etc.
