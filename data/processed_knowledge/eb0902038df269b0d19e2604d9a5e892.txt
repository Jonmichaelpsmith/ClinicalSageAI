Abstract: For individuals experiencing pain, the decision to engage in clinical trials may be inﬂu-
enced by a number of factors including current and past care, illness severity, physical functioning,ﬁnancial stress, and caregiver support. Co-occurring depression and anxiety may add to these chal-lenges. The aim of this scoping review was to describe perspectives about clinical trial participation,including recruitment and retention among individuals with pain and pain comorbidities, includingdepression and/or anxiety. We searched PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Cochrane CENTRAL data-bases. Study features, sample demographics, perspectives, barriers and/or motivations were collected
and described. A total of 35 assessments were included in this scoping review with 24 focused on
individuals with pain (24/35, 68.6%), 9 on individuals with depression and/or anxiety (9/35, 25.7%),and 2 on individuals with pain and co-occurring depression/anxiety (2/35, 5.7%). Barriers among par-ticipants with pain and those with depression included: research team’s communication of informa-tion, fear of interventional risks, distrust (only among respondents with pain), too many procedures,fear of inadequate treatment, disease-life stressors, and embarrassment with study procedures (morecommonly reported in participants with depression). Facilitators in both groups included: altruismand supportive staff, better access to care, and the ability to have outcome feedback (more commonly
among individuals with depression). Individuals with pain and depression experience challenges that
affect trial recruitment and retention. Engaging individuals with pain within research planning mayassist in addressing these barriers and the needs of individuals affected by pain and/or depression.
Perspective: This review highlights the need to address barriers and facilitators to participation in
clinical trials, including the need for an assessment of perspectives from underserved or marginalizedpopulations.

care, severity of illness, physical functioning, ﬁnancial
stress, and caregiver support, among other factors.
Research outside the context of pain (eg, cancer, HIV,
depression) has assessed barriers and facilitators thataffect trial participation.
41Personal beneﬁt, altruism,
and trust were found to be facilitating factors for studyparticipation, regardless of research setting and trialdesign. Barriers were commonly reported and variedamong different populations and severities of illness.Practical challenges were noted as well as barriers spe-ciﬁc to trial-based research, with participants expressingconcerns about randomization, treatment changes, andthe inherent uncertainty of trials.
41Identifying if these
features are similar among individuals with pain can
assist researchers with study design and recruitment andretention, and in turn, research efﬁciency and generaliz-ability.
A qualitative synthesis of 15 studies assessed factors
that impact trial recruitment among patients withdepression.
25Findings indicated that patients with
depression are less likely to participate in research if itmight exacerbate their condition. Additionally, con-cerns about cognitive capacity for consent and patientwelfare, treatment preferences, and trial burden were
all noted as barriers to participation. The symptoms and
presentation of depression were a barrier noted amongmany studies. Although the assessment of trial-speciﬁcfactors affecting recruitment has been completedamong patients with depression, it has not been exam-ined within the context of pain.
Pain and depression are conditions that often co-
occur.
2Observational research has suggested a bidirec-
tional relationship among pain and mental illness, spe-ciﬁcally depression and anxiety.
7Signs and symptoms of
depression (eg, loss of motivation and interest, fatigue,
etc.) and anxiety likely inﬂuence willingness to partici-
pate and retention in clinical trials.25Addressing these
factors may increase the efﬁciency of conducting trialsand reduce the negative impact on recruitment andretention within clinical studies.
The purpose of this review is to describe perspectives
about clinical trial participation, including barriers andfacilitators for trial recruitment and retention amongindividuals with pain-related conditions, depression,and/or anxiety. A scoping review was deemed appropri-ate due to the broad nature of the topic, the heteroge-
neity and diversity of sample populations, and the
varied methods (ie, qualitative and quantitative) to cap-ture individual perspectives. This review did not aim tocritically appraise evidence but instead describe perspec-tives as it relates to participation in clinical trials.
36
Because depression/anxiety and pain frequently co-occur, we hypothesized that there would be similar per-spectives between these conditions but also reportedany differences.
Methods
This scoping review was conducted according to the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews andMeta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-
ScR) Checklist (Appendix 1).48,40Given that the report
represents a scoping review of the literature, registra-
tion was not permitted according to PROSPERO guide-lines.
Eligibility Criteria
Studies were included if they assessed patient-speciﬁc
preferences related to clinical trial participation, recruit-ment, or retention (barriers, facilitators, etc.) for thetreatment of any pain condition, depression, and/oranxiety. Facilitators were characteristics that motivatedtrial participation and/or supported participation for
individuals. Exclusion criteria were: assessments of treat-
ment preferences or goals of therapy only, assessmentsof researcher preferences, studies that assessed mixedsamples of patients and clinicians without separatingthe data, studies that only provided reasons for trialdropouts or attrition without any other data or qualita-tive component (ie, interview, survey or focus group), orabstracts without data if further information could notbe obtained.
Although we did not speciﬁcally search for perspec-
tives about treatment outcomes, upon review of full-
texts, we decided to evaluate any that were within our
search results. Much of that research has already beenaddressed by Initiative on Methods, Measurement, andPain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT).
49For stud-
ies where pain, depression, and/or anxiety were second-ary to another condition, the perspective assessmentneeded to address something relevant to one of thosecomponents. Although literature searches were focusedon pain, depression, and/or anxiety, any psychiatric con-dition was included if it otherwise met criteria for inclu-sion.
Information Sources
PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied
Health Literature (CINAHL), American PsychologicalAssociation PsycInfo and Cochrane CENTRAL weresearched from inception through December 14, 2020and February 5, 2021, respectively, using appropriatesearch terminology (Appendix 2). Authors of publishedabstracts were contacted for additional information.Reference lists of relevant articles were also reviewedfor additional studies.
Data Review Process and Extraction
Title/abstract screening and full-text review were per-
formed independently by at least 2 review authors (MF,EM, AK, KS). Disagreement between reviewers wasresolved by discussion. When agreement could not bereached, a third author (MF, EM) adjudicated.
Four authors (MF, EM, AK, KS) performed data extrac-
tion. At least 2 authors independently extracted infor-mation from each article. A data extraction form waspiloted prior to use (Appendix 3). In addition, a codingmanual was developed to clarify entry and promoteconsistency in the evaluation of methodology.Ferguson et al The Journal of Pain 25

Information related to study features, sample demo-
graphics, perspectives related to trial design and bar-
riers and/or motivating factors to trial participation
were collected (Appendix 3). As part of project plan-ning, authors identiﬁed how other researchers (ie,O’Cathain 2013, Sheridan 2020, Cheung 2020) assignedperspectives into thematic categories. We approachedthe process in a similar fashion.
10,38,41Where possible,
we utilized coding/interpretations as they were pre-sented by the original authors. When articles did notprovide speciﬁc themes, we categorized perspectiveswithout duplicating across categories. Comparisons ofpreferences between pain, depression, and anxiety
were planned if the sample for each was large enough.
Critical appraisal of evidence quality was not conducted.Descriptive statistics were used, where applicable. Per-spectives related to study design were categorized bytheme.
Results
Search results identiﬁed 660 de-duplicated records
from the initial search across all databases. Of these, 604
(91.5%) were excluded due to lack of eligibility, based
on title and abstract screening. A total of 61 full-textarticles were reviewed with 27 excluded ( Fig 1 ) for the
following reasons: lack of data about preferencesrelated to clinical trial design (6/27, 22.2%); abstractwithout data (4/27, 14.8%); no pain or psychiatric condi-tion (4/27, 14.8%); focused on treatment preferencesonly (4/27, 14.8%); mixed sample without separation ofparticipant perspectives (3/27, 11.1%); duplicate
research (1/27, 3.7%); assessment unrelated to pain or
psychiatric condition (1/27, 3.7%); or other reasons (4/
27, 14.8%). One study performed 2 separate phases ofdata collection, so each phase was extracted sepa-rately.
49This yielded a total of 35 extracted assessments
across 34 articles ( Table 1 , Appendix 4). For all results,
the N=35 unless otherwise noted.
Study Features
Perspectives were obtained from individuals with pain
(24/35, 68.6%); depression, and/or anxiety (9/35, 25.7%);or pain with some having co-occurring anxiety/depres-
sion (2/35, 5.7%). Within assessments only reporting
pain (N=24), pain was primarily chronic in nature andincluded: juvenile arthritis (3/24, 12.5%); osteoarthritis(3/24, 12.5%); pelvic pain (3/24, 12.5%); mixed chronicpain (2/24, 8.3%); headache (2/24, 8.3%); chronic painnot otherwise speciﬁed (2/24, 8.3%); back and/or jointpain not otherwise speciﬁed (1/24, 4.2%); chest painpost-acute coronary syndrome (1/24, 4.2%), cancer-related pain (1/24, 4.2%), Duchenne muscular dystrophy(1/24, 4.2%), rheumatoid arthritis (1/24, 4.2%), sicklecell disease (1/24, 4.2%), gout (1/24, 4.2%), spinal steno-
sis (1/24, 4.2%), and end-of-life pain (1/24, 4.2%).
Nine assessments obtained perspectives from individ-
uals with both pain and with depression and/or anxiety,7/9 (77.8%) focused entirely on depression, while 2/9(22.2%) focused on depression and anxiety. One of the2 assessments focusing on depression and anxiety notedthe coexistence of anxiety without stating how manypatients also had anxiety

Within the 2 assessments that focused on pain with
some of the sample also reporting depression, 1 assess-ment reported perspectives from 1,621 participants
with 9 different primary conditions, including: rheuma-
toid arthritis (125/1621, 8%), ﬁbromyalgia (241/1621,15%), and depression (91/1621, 5%), among othersunrelated to pain or depression/anxiety.
13The other
study obtained perspectives from 501 patients withmore than 2 chronic conditions, with participants ableto select multiple chronic conditions. Of the 501 partici-pants in the sample with at least 2 chronic conditions,177/501 (35%) were noted to have back pain, 215/501
(43%) had joint pain, and 210/501 (42%) had depres-
sion.

comparisons of perspectives between individuals with
pain versus depression versus anxiety or any combina-tion of these, but we have presented ﬁndings separatelyfor the assessments among individuals with pain versuspain and depression/anxiety versus depression/anxietyonly and noted differences where data were available.
Perspectives were gathered from individuals with
pain using survey-based methods (13/35, 37%), individ-ual interviews (9/35, 25.7%), mixed methods (ie, surveyand individual interviews, 8/35, 23%), and focus groups(2/35, 5.7%). Three studies (3/35, 8.6%) ( Table 1 ) utilized
alternative methods. Of the studies using alternative
methods, 2 studies captured perspectives via a conjointdecision-making exercise, and the other by having par-ticipants read 3 brief vignettes followed by questions onthe Credibility and Expectancy Scale.
20,43,46
Most studies obtained patient or caregiver perspec-
tives as a primary objective (23/35, 65.7%), or wereembedded within pilot/feasibility studies (12/35,34.3%). Studies utilized mostly active and direct recruit-ment (23/35, 65.7%), largely from clinics, registries,mailed invitation, and practitioner referral. Studies alsoutilized passive recruitment (3/35, 8.5%) (eg, indirect
strategies such as advertisements or ﬂyers), mixed
recruitment strategies (5/25, 14.2%), or were notdescribed (4/35, 11.4%). A total of 17/35 (49%) of studiesincluded participants with current and/or past participa-tion in clinical research studies. Twelve included currentparticipation (100% of the sample) within pilot/feasibil-ity studies, and 5 studies reported some (but not all)past trial participation. Within these, the number withinthe sample ranged from 12% to 75%.
Study sites were located in metropolitan areas (22/35,
62.8%), listed as rural/urban/semi-urban
35(1/35, 2.8%)
or as location not described/other (12/35 34.2%). Other
locations included no physical study site (ie, participantswere assessed via an online survey and/or by a mailed-insurvey). Locations of participants included respondents
only within the U.S. (11/35, 31.4%), outside the U.S. (21/35, 60%) and mixed geographic locations (3/35, 8.5%).
Sample Demographics
Studies obtained adult perspectives (26/35, 74.2%),
pediatric perspectives (2/35, 5.7%), both adult and pedi-atric perspectives (5/35,14.2%), or were not described(2/35, 5.7%). In the 2 studies that focused on pediatricperspectives, 1 was in childrenaffected by Duchennemuscular dystrophy and the other assessed adolescentsaffected by depression.
33,51In the 5 studies with mixed
samples, all perspectives were obtained from partici-
pants with pain.22,32,35,42,47In the 2 studies that did not
describe the age of the study sample, participants wereassumed to be adults based on the disease stateassessed.
26,37Five studies (14.2%) included mostly older
patients based on the average age of the sample, 3 ofwhich were in patients with pain, 1 in patients withdepression and 1 in patients with mental healthimpacted by Parkinson’s disease.
5,8,14,21,30
Among studies reporting gender (27/35, 77.1%), 14
studies noted the sample was represented by >70%
female participants. Eight studies (22.8%) did not reportgender or sex assigned at birth for the sample, and no
studies reported other gender identities. Eleven assess-
ments (31.4%) required English literacy as part of studyinclusion. One study (2.8%) purposefully sampledwomen experiencing economic hardship living withdepression from divested areas in England.
12
Racial/ethnic identity ( Fig 2 ) was reported for the sam-
ple in only 15/35 (42.9%) studies. Within studies that col-lected information on racial/ethnic identity, the numberof studies with participants identifying as one of follow-ing races/ethnicities included: White (14/15, 93.3%),Black (9/15, 60%), Asian (8/15, 53.3%), Native-American
Figure 2. Race distributions of participants providing perspectives, N=15 (Color).Ferguson et al The Journal of Pain 29

(6/15, 40%), Hispanic/Latino (4/17, 23.5%), and multira-
cial (3/15, 20%). Where reported, racial/ethnic percen-tages ranged from: 67 to 100% for White; 0 to 21% forBlack; 0 to13% for Asian; 0 to 5% for Hispanic/Latino; 0
to 2.6% Native-American; and 0 to 3.5% for multiracial.
Other study features were infrequently and inconsis-
tently reported among studies, including level of educa-tion (12/35, 34.2%); participants living with someoneelse in the household (10/35, 28.6%); employment status(10/35, 28.6%); insurance status (1/35, 2.8%); and dis-ease duration (7/35, 20%) and severity (12/35, 34.2%).
Barriers to Trial Participation
Studies that reported barriers to clinical trial partici-
pation are noted within Fig 3 and separated by individu-
als with pain, depression, and mixed illness. Sevenstudies identiﬁed concerns related to the research
team’s communication of information as barriers to par-
ticipation, 4 of which were among individuals with painand 3 among individuals with depression and/or anxi-ety. Fear of interventional risks, distrust of healthcareproviders, concerns about too many study procedures,fear of inadequate treatment, and disease-life stressorswere more frequently noted as a barrier among patientswith pain. In 1 study that purposefully recruited partici-pants from divested areas among individuals experienc-ing economic hardship, some of the patients whodeclined to participate stated that they would not beable to attend any groups because of family commit-
ments such as lack of regular childcare.
12
Embarrassment with study procedures was mostly
noted among participants with depression. These con-cerns were expressed as feeling self-conscious, the intru-sive nature of the questions asked, embarrassment withbringing up the past, and symptoms of illness that cre-ated anxiety and embarrassment.
3,12,14,33
Distrust of providers was noted as feelings of skepti-
cism with clinical research.1,8This barrier was exclusively
reported in the studies of pain. One study noted theimportance of cultural sensitivity and awareness of thechallenges faced by individuals affected by the presence
of sickle cell disease.
47
Among patients with chronic pain, disease-related
stigma was noted as fear of labeling or judgment based
upon past opioid use.26For patients with sickle cell dis-
ease, this was described as being “relegated to the sta-tus of only a Black disease”.
47For patients with mental
health impacted by Parkinson’s disease, disease-relatedstigma was related to changes in bowel movements, sex-ual activity, and mood.
14
Motivations for Trial Participation
Fig 4 depicts studies that addressed motivating factors
to clinical trial participation. Fifteen studies noted thata desire to help others is a motivation to participate inclinical trials. Additionally, rapport of research staff ismotivating; notably staff that were empathetic, atten-tive listeners, trustworthy, and sociodemographicallyrepresentative of people normally affected by the con-dition. Better access to care was described more oftenamong patients with pain whereas receipt of outcomefeedback, such as sharing data relevant to progress orimprovement with participants was a motivator more
commonly noted among patients with depression.
Perspectives Related to Trial Design That
Affect Willingness to Participate
Recruitment, Randomization, and Blinding
Personal referral from the patient’s primary care pro-
vider was noted in 2 studies, both of which included indi-viduals with depression, as an inﬂuencing factor inwillingness to participate.
12,13Four studies among individ-
uals with pain, depression, and mixed samples noted con-cerns with blinding and reported that people with painwould not agree to participate in studies if they wereblinded.
10,13,28,50Randomization was a source of concern,
discomfort, and at times, confusion for participants. Threestudies noted that an element of choice within theFigure 3. Percentage and number of studies reporting barriers to clinical trial participation (Color).30 The Journal of Pain Perspectives about Clinical Trial Design

randomization process would enhance willingness to
participate.15,32,50Detailed communication of information
about trial details, safety, and expectations of participa-
tion was noted among many studies as a factor affecting
willingness to participate.3,14,26,33,37,47,51
Compensation, Time, and Transportation
The ability to continue treatment after study comple-
tion was noted in 1 study, particularly as it related topatient payment for therapy and rehabilitation serv-ices.
8Another study noted that coverage for study-
related injury was a factor that affected willingness toparticipate.
13Other studies indicated that providing
enough compensation was important10,14,26and 1 study
suggested weekly compensation for time and travel waspreferred.
43
Concerns related to transportation were noted
among 5 studies1,8,13,14,29, 2 of which were in older
populations.8,14The ability to drive, access transporta-
tion, and fears about the distance to study visits werenoted in the study of patients with mental healthaffected by Parkinson’s disease.
14
A lack of time for study visits, and the duration and
frequency of study visits were concerns noted withinseveral studies. All concerns but one were reported byindividuals impacted by pain.
1,5,8,10,15,32,43Comments
related to too many study sessions, interference withwork or family, and suggestions to reduce the numberand duration of follow-up visits were described. Con-
versely, for assessments in women with pelvic pain, a
longer study duration (3-year) was widely noted asacceptable by patients to allow time for extra monitor-ing and time for “the body to adjust” and have breaksbetween adjustments.
15,32
Interventions and Access to Current and/or
Past Treatments
Willingness to participate based upon factors related
to the interventions administered was affected by manyfactors. Fears of interventional risks were expressed as
concerns about side effects and return ofsymptoms.
13,15,22,26,42,47For studies involving patients
with pain, the decision to participate was heavily inﬂu-
enced by past experiences with treatment. Also, routeof administration was noted as a factor, particularlyamong parents, and within assessments of parenteraltherapies.
15,42The inconvenience of administration of
injections and impact on the ability to go to school andwork was noted.
15In 1 study, patients who took opioids
were generally willing to participate in an opioid taper-ing study.
26For participants with headache, most sur-
veyed would agree to take part in a placebo-controlledstudy and would not ﬁnd it unpleasant to learn if their
symptoms responded to placebo.
28Drugs with longer
durations of action and the ability to decide when totreat acute attacks were preferred among individualswith headache.
28
Assessments of individuals with depression noted a
preference for psychotherapy19,20, and 1 study indicated
that patients were not interested in counseling.3In an
assessment of a small cohort of patients with depres-sion, all agreed they would not be willing to participatein authorized deceptive design, in which individuals aretold in advance about a temporary deceptive element inthe trial. Nor willing to participate in post-hoc deceptive
design, when a participant is notiﬁed after the trial is
over that deception occurred.
16In addition, patients
indicated that the possibility of placebo or inadequatetreatment alternatives impacted their willingness toparticipate.
13,16In individual interviews of 76 adoles-
cents with depression, 50% noted it was difﬁcult toremember the differences among the 3 arms of psycho-logical therapy, and “few” had a clear understanding ofthe differences among each arm.
33
The desire to access past treatments was noted within
fears of inadequate treatment and the ability to take
current medications.1,3,15,22,26,30,42,40All of these assess-
ments, except for one30, were in patients with pain.
Fears related to withdrawal or unfair drug

discontinuation without other effective options for the
management of chronic pain26or the desire to avoid
past treatments that were ineffective1,3,15,22,42were
noted. Among patients with depression, 1 studydescribed preference to tailor treatments based on pastexperience, symptoms, and side effects.
30
Outcomes and Data Collection
Five studies focused entirely on outcome preferences
within clinical trials among individuals withpain.
35,44,46,49,53Outcome prioritization mostly focused
on pain relief, functional improvement, and quality of
life. In one study among patients with depression30, pre-
ferred outcomes were psychological well-being andsymptomatic improvement as well as safety (ie, avoid-ance of fall-related injury) associated with antidepres-sants.
In terms of data collection methods, four studies noted
that in-home visits offered convenience, ﬂexibility and/orsupported rapport with research staff.
5,33,37,45One study
noted that electronic tablet-based assessments for self-reported psychological well-being were largely accept-able among participants.
30Study participants preferred
fewer study procedures including reduced number of
assessments; less frequent assessments; and proceduresthat require less time.
1,5,6,10,13−16,29,42,43,43,45One study
among patients with depression noted that question-naires were lengthy, repetitive, and difﬁcult tounderstand.
45
Less invasive outcome assessments and forms of data
collection are preferred.6,43,45,51One study noted that
patients thought that trials that included more invasivemeasures (eg, biopsy and cold water sensory testing)warranted higher compensation.
43
No studies provided participant perspectives related
to parallel vs crossover or pragmatic vs efﬁcacy designs.In addition, no studies assessed whether source of fund-ing affects trial participation.
Discussion
Our ﬁndings largely noted preferences among indi-
viduals affected by pain and to a lesser extent preferen-ces among individuals with depression. We did notidentify any assessments solely focused on individualswith anxiety. Only 2 assessments noted anxiety co-occur-ring with depression and 2 assessments noted pain co-occurring with depression in proportion of the overallsample. Despite this, it is more than likely that some pro-
portion of individuals in the “pain only” assessments
also had co-occurring, but not reported, depression oranxiety and vice versa for the assessments of individualswith depression only.
Outside of altruism and staff rapport, facilitators for
trial participation largely reﬂect individuals with painwho may not be satisﬁed with current outcomes and/orseek alternative treatment options, which aligns withwho is generally recruited into clinical trials.
4The bur-
den of illness can affect trial participation, including theneed for enhanced social support and transportation ifmobility is impacted or if distance from clinical study
sites is perceived as inconvenient. The impact of disease-
related stigma and concerns related to privacy may also
deter participation. For some populations with children,declining participation and dropouts are due to lack ofchildcare.
12Among individuals with chronic pain,
research has shown that a shift to telehealth may offersolutions to some of the barriers we identiﬁed. Tele-health may offer greater ﬂexibility as it relates to easeof access and convenience, while also promotingempowerment via self-knowledge and self-efﬁcacy.However, the delivery of telehealth presents its ownbarriers, including the impersonal aspects of delivery,
challenges with technology, and the need for digital
literacy.
17,18
Direct referral by a provider may also facilitate partici-
pation in clinical trials.12,13Although it may be argued
that added attention by providers may augment pla-cebo effects or be a source of bias, advocating for anindividualized approach should be the priority withpatient care and research alike. Increasing healthcareprovider knowledge of research opportunities and dis-ease-related stigma, along with recruiting via use ofsocial media and community networks were noted as
important.
47
Most studies did not report additional comorbidities
of the sample population, and as previously mentioned,it was likely that pain, depression, anxiety, and othermental health disorders coexisted among the study pop-ulations.
2Post-hoc analysis of exclusion criteria from the
24 studies that assessed ‘pain only’ revealed that noneof these studies explicitly excluded participants withmental health comorbidities. In fact, many formally orinformally assessed the effect of pain on mood. Manyassessments lacked consistent reporting of features that
may be relevant for consideration in the context of
patient or caregiver perspective. Population featuressuch as education, caregiver support, employment and/or disability, and pain severity were infrequently orinconsistently reported.
There are several notable gaps to the literature. One
notable gap was the lack of assessment from under-served or marginalized populations. Only 1 studydescribed recruitment strategies that deliberatelyinvolved reaching out to individuals experiencing eco-nomic hardship.
12In addition, methodology within of
some of the assessments, such as the requirement for
internet access or for multiple onsite visits, may havereduced the ability or willingness of some populationsto engage. Where demographic data were presented, alack of diverse representation appeared to be con-ﬁrmed. For example, for studies that reported demo-graphics related to gender, most were heavilyrepresented by female views. For those that reportedrace, the participants were overwhelmingly white andwere disproportionately so in studies conducted in theUnited States. And, more than a third of studies (31%)required English literacy as part of participation. Based
on a lack of reporting, we could not determine whether
individuals living in rural settings, those without routineaccess to healthcare, those with lower education levels32 The Journal of Pain Perspectives about Clinical Trial Design

or those not currently being paid for work were ade-
quately represented. In addition, 17/35 (49%) of studies
included participants with current and/or past participa-
tion in clinical research studies, 12/35 (34.3%) of whichwere part within pilot/feasibility studies. Therefore, theperspectives within this review lack diversity and repre-sentation and may not reﬂect the opinions of individu-als who do not actively seek treatment.
Given this, community-based recruitment efforts to
address barriers and facilitators among individuals withpain outside the healthcare system are needed. Focus-ing on marginalized communities and rebuilding trustare necessary to more broadly reﬂect true community
needs. Collecting reasons for declining participation
may be helpful in these efforts as well as efforts to dif-ferentiate perspectives among individuals with past/cur-rent trial participation versus those without. We wereunable to make comparisons that need to be systemati-cally addressed in future research.
Although few studies in our review reported comor-
bid diagnoses, it is very likely that individuals withchronic pain have coexisting illnesses. The barriers andfacilitators identiﬁed in this review among individualswith pain and/or depression align with other research.
41
A systematic review of 26 different systematic reviewsexamined facilitators and barriers to research participa-tion for any medical condition. Personal beneﬁt andextra attention along with access to new therapies was
noted most commonly as a facilitator followed by altru-
ism, rapport, burden and convenience, and ﬁnancial
beneﬁt. Barriers to participation noted within thatreview included fears related to safety; followed bypractical difﬁculties with time; transportation and cost;distrust; aversion to randomization; speciﬁc treatmentpreferences; stigma; uncertainty; and desire for choice.Some barriers were noted within speciﬁc populations.For example, distrust was reported as a barrier withinminoritized and marginalized groups and stigma was abarrier to recruitment for trials in HIV or mentalhealth.
41Our ﬁndings about distrust were among indi-
viduals with pain, 1 study was in patients with sickle cell
disease and 2 studies had a population average ageover 70 years.
1,6,8,26,47The lived experiences of patients
who have experienced racialized discrimination addscontext for this distrust and underscores the need forantiracism practices in study design and disseminationof ﬁndings.
34Within our ﬁndings, embarrassment with
study procedures was more commonly noted amongstudies that included individuals with psychological ill-ness, including adults and adolescents withdepression.
3,12,14,33Table 2 provides some considera-
tions for engaging patients affected by pain and depres-
sion into clinical trials.11,23,24,27,31,47
A qualitative synthesis of 15 studies assessed factors
that affect trial recruitment of patients with depres-sion.
25Many of these studies included mixed samples of
patient and researcher perspectives, which was outsidethe scope of our review. However, four studies from thisanalysis were included in our review.
3,12,16,45Our ﬁnd-
ings indicated that among individuals with depression,recruitment into trials was found to be affected bysymptoms of depression, the risk of the study to mental
health
3,16, stigma45, and participant welfare and vulner-
ability16. Studies from the larger analysis also noted dif-
ﬁculties in recruiting due to the burden andinconvenience of trial procedures, treatment preferen-ces, and the challenges with presenting research oppor-tunities to individuals with depression.
3,16,25,45
Rapport of the research team is a key component to
retention in clinical trials. Also, the research teamshould be representative of the targeted population.Training and educating the team on cultural sensitivity,disease burden, and stigma may beneﬁt recruitment
and retention within clinical trials. Some individuals
who participate in clinical trials perceive themselves asvolunteers, and as such are hesitant to discuss other rel-evant medical issues due to it perhaps conﬂicting withthe research agenda. One study captured these feelingsin quotes such as “volunteer of my time, my body” and“we’re here for their research not my research”.
39
Concerns with randomization, blinding, and access to
effective treatment were noted among individuals withpain and depression. Partially randomized study designshave been utilized to incorporate an element of partici-pant preference into the randomization process. In an
assessment of treatment options for patients with endo-
metriosis, Middleton et al utilized a ﬂexible-entry, adap-tive design model with a ﬁrst-phase feasibilityTable 2. Clinical Trial Design Considerations for
Recruitment and Retention.
Recruitment Considerations11,23,24,27,31,47
/C15Direct and strategic recruitment to underserved and understudied patient
populations is needed. Consider the use of patient partners to developrecruitment strategies.
/C15Education of the public via press, internet, or social media regarding the
importance of clinical trials and how to access research opportunities.
/C15Providers may need education about how to connect patients with research
opportunities.
Trial Design Considerations38
/C15The research team should be diverse and empathetic. Rapport with study
participants may improve retention.
/C15Researchers may consider adding an element of choice into trial design (e.g.,
the ability to opt out of a non-preferred treatment).
/C15Researchers may consider the addition of a qualitative component within
clinical trials to assess engagement, perspectives related to design and pref-erences, and reasons for declining participation and dropouts.
/C15Researchers may consider reporting reasons for and demographics of those
declining participation as a way to better understand individual needs, par-ticularly those of marginalized communities.
Trial Conduct Considerations
/C15Researchers should utilize multiple strategies and modalities for communica-
tion to deliver study-related information (e.g., written handouts, regularnewsletter updates, videos, etc.).
/C15Engage participants, patient partners, or both to ensure appropriate com-
pensation of time and travel and consider enabling access to treatment aftercompletion of the trial.Ferguson et al The Journal of Pain 33

assessment to gauge willingness to core design features
(randomization, control, etc.) followed by clinician and
participant discussion about which drug within a class
of options would be preferred.32Partially randomized
designs assign those who were willing to be randomizedas usual, and those not willing to be randomized areassigned to treatment based on preferences, althoughthese design strategies are not very common amongindividuals with chronic pain.
52In our ﬁndings, one
study which evaluated a mixed sample of patients withback and joint pain, 42% of which also had depression,suggested that the average patient prefers personalizedtrials that are less burdensome in terms of cost and time
commitment, but that patient preference in personal-
ized trials is highly variable, suggesting that individualdifferences must be accounted for when recruiting par-ticipants.
10Another recruitment consideration may be
to offer an open-label extension to all participants whocomplete the blinded phase of a study.
Input by individuals with pain adds value to clinical
research. Such partners can assist with many aspects oftrial design including recruitment considerations andstrategies; adequate compensation for time and travel;modes and format of data collection; patient-oriented
outcome measures; review and formatting of communi-
cation of study information; and results dissemination.
9
Incorporating a qualitative component into study meth-ods at the pretrial stage as part of a pilot or feasibilitystudy should be considered. If engagement of potentialparticipants is not feasible before research is com-menced, strategies can be implemented within ongoingtrials or upon conclusion of participation.
38The Patient
Centered Outcomes Research Initiative (PCORI) in the U.S., Canada’s Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research(SPOR), and Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) within
the United Kingdom highlight just a few of the interna-
tional efforts to engage patients as partners in clinicaltrials.
23Building research relationships with individuals
with pain as life-long partners can beneﬁt all stakehold-ers.
This scoping review provides the ﬁrst overview, to our
knowledge, of patient and participant perspectives asthey relate to study participation, recruitment andretention in trials among patients with pain and depres-sion. A lack of information was found related to individ-uals with anxiety. We performed a broad search across
multiple databases and included any painful condition
across any age group. Limitations related to the per-spectives collected within this review have been noted.We employed identical search strategies for each of thedisease states of interest (pain, depression, and anxiety),yet it is likely some relevant literature was not foundgiven the scope of vocabulary for this topic. In addition,our review lacked formal evaluation of included studieswith respect to study quality and bias. Data collectionmethods (eg, open-ended questions, targeted ques-tions, etc.) could bias the ﬁndings. We also extractedand included data, such as insurance coverage
(although not commonly noted), that may not be rele-
vant to individuals outside of the U.S.Conclusions
This review identiﬁed patient preferences that affect
willingness to participate in clinical trials among individ-uals with pain and depression. Despite including anxietywithin our search, we did not ﬁnd sufﬁcient data aboutperspectives in the setting of anxiety. Although altruismand the rapport of the research team are motivatingreasons for participation among many individuals withpain, it is also important to recognize that chronic painand depression can present challenges to recruitment
and retention within clinical trials. The assessment of
perspectives, barriers, and facilitators in underservedpopulations is needed, as the current evidence lacksdiverse representation. Engaging individuals with painin the research planning process may assist in addressingthe barriers and the needs of individuals affected bypain and/or depression.
