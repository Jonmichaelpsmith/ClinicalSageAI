161Introduction
The results of clinical trials provide the best  
evidence of the ef/f_icacy and safety of drugs and 
are essential to progress e
vidence based medicine 
(EBM).1, 2) Clinical trials have been conducted in 
large numbers all over the world, and the number is growing every year according to the Clinical -
Trials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/resources/trends, 
March 25, 2021). Clinical trial design is 
one of the factors that de/f_ine the level of evidence. 
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are normally 
performed to compare efficacy and safety be -

ɹThe results of clinical trials are essential for the advancement of evidence-based medicine (EBM). Our previous  
research using the Relative Citation Ratio (RCR), article-based citation metric developed by the National Institutes of 
H
ealth (NIH), identi/f_ied that the outcomes of clinical trials designed to have a high evidence level, such as large sized 
randomized trials, and those with novel interventions have higher scienti/f_ic in/f_luence. In the present study, aiming to further investigate the factors that improve the scienti/f_ic in/f_luence of clinical study results, we focused on randomized controlled trial (RCT) and evaluated the relationship between study design and RCR of drug intervention RCTs in  
patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Publications of drug intervention RCTs for NSCLC patients published 
b
etween 2007 and 2016 were included. Clinical trial design factors were compared among three RCR categories with 50 
trials in each: lowest RCR (LOW50), median RCR (50 NIH percentile [50NIH ˋile]), and highest RCR (TOP50) group. 
The numbers of Phase 3, multi-country, for-pro/f_it company sponsored/supported, and statistically powered RCTs, which confirmed pre-defined differences between/among interventions, increased by more than 30 ˋ from 50NIH ˋile to 
TOP50. The number of novel interventions such as EGFR-TKI and Immune checkpoint inhibitors were also increased as 
RCR increased. Our results indicate quantitatively that the clinical trial design is an important factor that affects scienti/f_ic 
in/f_luence of the RCT outcome. RCTs should be suf/f_iciently large to generate statistically con/f_irmatory outcomes, be  
conducted in multiple countries, and use newer drugs in order to better contribute to the progress of EBM.

tween/among different interventions and are 
known to have the lowest biases and provide 
stronger evidence compared to other trial designs.2, 3)
Some research has investigated the relationship 
between clinical trial characteristics and scienti/f_ic influence of the trial outcome by bibliometric  
approach.
4-7) Bibliometrics is a quantitative analysis 
of published papers. The Journal Impact Factor (JIF), h-index, and number of citations of the publication are well-known indicators and have been used to assess productivity of researchers/institutions or used for researches assessing  
scientific influence of published clinical trials. Note
162
Jpn J Pharm Health Care SciPrevious evidence using the above indices sug -
gested publications of positive outcome tended to 
ha
ve higher scienti/f_ic impact, and higher impact 
factor journals tended to have higher sample size and used lower bias methodologies in clinical  
trials.
4-7) However, the existing bibliometric indices 
are not appropriate when assessing individual publications.
8) In order to overcome this disadvan-
tage, NIH developed the Relative Citation Ratio (
RCR) in 2015. The RCR is a /f_ield-adjusted and 
time-adjusted index based on the number of  
citations. RCR is calculated by dividing the num -
ber of citations per year by the expected number of
 citations per year. It has been validated by  
experts and quantifies the scientific influence of indi
vidual publications.9) Publications from differ -
ent disciplines can be compared by defining the discipline of the tar
get publications using a new 
method, named the co-citation network. Articles funded by the NIH Research Project Grant Pro -
gram R01 (NIH-R01) were benchmarked and 
R
CR = 1.0 is the median RCR of NIH-funded  
research publications (50 NIH percentile [50NIH 
ˋile]) in any /f_ield. Currently, the RCR is used not 
o
nly in the NIH, but also outside of the NIH.10-12)
Our previous research, the first research  
focused on the study design of drug intervention 
clinical trial including all study phases and
  
assessed the scientific influence of the outcome using the RCR, identi/f_ied drug interv
ention clini -
cal trials designed to have a high evidence level, such as lar
ge sized randomized trials have higher 
scientific influence of the outcome, and novel  
interventions also improve the in/f_luence of clinical 
trial outcomes. Ho
wever, we could not identify 
the definitive factors to increase the scientific  
influence due to a certain degree of correlation between v
ariables.13) In the present study, aiming 
to further investigate the factors that improve the scientific influence of clinical study results, we narrowed our focus on RCTs, which is known to provide the most reliable clinical evidence, and evaluated the relationship between study design and RCR of drug intervention RCTs in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) pub -
lished between 2007 and 2016.
In the pre
vious and present research, we  
focused on NSCLC to minimize variations in c
linical trial design patterns by disease areas. 
Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers globally and the leading cause of cancer death. In 2020, approximately 1.8 million people died due to lung cancer worldwide.
14) NSCLC accounts for 
around 85ˋ of all lung cancers. Cytotoxic che -
motherapy has been the main treatment option for NSCLC in the last 10 years; ho
wever, in recent 
years, the therapeutic algorithm and treatment  
options have changed drastically due to emerging molecular
-target drugs. Predictive biomarker tests 
have enabled the identification of highly effica -
cious treatment options, and the prognosis has been greatly impro
ved compared to chemotherapy.15) 
Meanwhile, the unmet medical need remains high because most patients will experience disease progression despite the use of these highly ef/f_ica -
cious drugs, and thus, various drug intervention c
linical trials are being actively conducted today. 
NSCLC is, therefore, considered appropriate for 
this research because there were a significant 
number of clinical trials due to high unmet medical 
needs, the EBM was well established, and innovative new drugs have emerged in recent years.
Materials and Methods
1. Publication sear ch
We used PubMed to search for publications on 
clinical trials for NSCLC because RCR was avail -
163
Vol 48ɼNo 4ʢ2022ʣable for PubMed indexed publications.9) On May 
6, 2019, we performed a PubMed search by refer -
ring the National Comprehensive Cancer Network 
(NCCN) guideline for NSCLC (https://www
.
nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/nscl.pdf, March 25, 2021). The search term was lnon-small cell lung cancer.z  The search results were 
narrowed by l studies in humansz  in the Species 
category, lpublished in Englishz in the Language 
category, and l Clinical Trial,z  lClinical Trial 
Phase 1 to 4,z or l RCTz in the Article type cate -
gory. In addition, the publications were narrowed to l
Published from 20070101 to 20161231z in the 
Publication date category to assess the changes over time during the most recent 10 years, specif -
ically in publications for which the RCR was a
vailable at the time of research initiation.13, 16-18) 
The PubMed identifier (PMID) of the matched publications were downloaded.
2. RCR and NIH per centile (NIH ˋile)
RCR and NIHˋile, percentile rank of each pa -
per`s RCR compared to NIH publications, are  
publicly available in website, named iCite (https://icite.od.nih.gov/analysis, May 6, 2019). We per -
formed an iCite search on May 6, 2019 by using t
he downloaded PMID, and obtained the RCR 
and NIHˋile of each publication.
3. Identification of eligible publications
Because the number of PubMed-searched pub -
lications exceeded 3,100, we set three categories, each with 50 publications, to in
vestigate the trend 
between the clinical trial characteristics and the RCR. Fifty publications were used in several  
bibliometrics analyses to investigate the top in/f_lu -
ential publications, and thus considered suf/f_icient when comparing the dif
ference of study design 
factors among the three RCR categories.19-21) The three categories were: (1) LOW50, 50 publica -
tions of the lowest RCR; (2) 50NIHˋile, 25 pub -
lications below and above the median RCR; and (3) 
TOP50, 50 publications in the highest RCR. 
We screened publications until 50 eligible publi -
cations were found for each category. We included 
original publications that reported the outcome of primary objecti
ves/endpoints of drug intervention 
RCT in NSCLC patients. A study was de/f_ined as an RCT if participants observed in the trial were assigned prospectively to one of two or more  
interventions using random allocation, as de/f_ined by the Cochrane Library (www
.training.cochrane.
org/handbook, March 25, 2021). We excluded publications reporting: i) trial results including other tumor types/disease other than NSCLC  
patients; ii) non-drug interventions, procedures, and biomark
ers (eg, supplements, surgical proce -
dures, radiation, chemoradiation, diagnostic pro -
cedures, biomarker assay, and validations); iii) retrospecti
ve or Phase 4 trials; iv) non-primary 
outcomes ( eg, data updates, sub-analyses, and 
pooled analyses of multiple trials); v) non-ran -
domized trials; and vi) others ( eg, study design,  
conference abstracts, commentaries, reviews, and FDA approval letters).
4. Identification of clinical trials
For all research, we searched corresponding 
clinical trials in clinical trial registries (ClinTrials.gov, Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center Clinical Trial Information, University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry, and European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials Database) to /f_ind data not provided in the publication, if available. A unique trial name, trial identifier, and/or other study characteristics such as indication, interven -
tions, number of subjects, and study outcomes 
164
Jpn J Pharm Health Care Sciwere used to identify the matched critical trial.
5. Data extraction
The following data were extracted from the 
publications or registries: trial phase, blinding 
status, trial sponsorship/support (for-profit com -
pany sponsored/supported or others), trial center (multi-center
, single-center, or unknown), trial 
country (multi-country or single-country, with country name), number of enrolled subjects, pri -
mary endpoints (survival-related, disease progres -
sion/recurrence-related, response-related, and other), 
statistical considerations (statistically 
powered to test the hypothesis of pre-de/f_ined dif -
ferences between/among interventions directly [statistically po
wered] or not), trial outcome of 
the statistically powered trial (positive: met pri -
mary endpoint; negative: did not meet primary endpoint), and interv
entions. In terms of trial 
sponsorship/support, a trial was classified as for-pro/f_it company sponsored/supported if: i) ex -
plicit acknowledgement of sponsorship/support from 
a for-pro/f_it company was provided in the ar -
ticle or trial registry; or ii) at least one author was an emplo
yee of a for-pro/f_it company.22, 23) In cases 
where the trial center information was not provided 
in the publication or trial registry, a trial was  
classi/f_ied as a single-center trial if all authors be -
longed to the same af/f_iliation and as a multi-center 
trial 
if there were multiple author af/f_iliations and 
multiple institutional review boards (IRBs) men -
tioned; otherwise, it was classi/f_ied as unknown.13) 
In cases where the trial country information was not provided in the publication or trial registry, a trial was classi/f_ied as single-country if all author institutions belonged to a single country; other -
wise, a trial was classi/f_ied as multi-country.6. Statistical analysis
A Fisher`s exact test was used to determine the 
differences in the proportion of each clinical trial design factor among LOW50, 50NIH ˋile and 
TOP50. A Kruskal-Wallis test was used to deter -
mine differences in the number of subjects among LO
W50, 50NIHˋile and TOP50. For all analy -
sis, StatsDirect 3 (StatsDirect Ltd, Merseyside, UK) w
as used, with P < 0.05 considered statisti -
cally signi/f_icant.
Results
1.  RCR of the publications in the thr ee 
RCR categories
The flow diagram of the publication selection 
process is shown in Fig 1 . Among the 3,100 pub -
lications published between 2007 to 2016, a total of 
1,021 publications (32.9ˋ) were screened to 
identify the 50 eligible publications in each cate -
gory. Figur e 2 shows the relationship between the 
RCR and NIHˋile of the 3,100 publications and the publications of the three RCR categories. The median RCRs of the LOW50, 50NIHˋile, and TOP50 publications were 0.14, 1.01, and 19.01, respectively.
2. Clinical trial design characteristics
Figure 3  shows the differences in the clinical 
trial design factors among the three RCR catego -
ries. For the trial phase ( Fig 3A), the number of 
Phase 3 trials increased from LOW50 (/f_ive trials, 10.0ˋ) to TOP50 (42 trials, 84.0ˋ). The number of Phase 2 trials was the same in the LOW50 and 50NIHˋile (33 trials, 66.0ˋ) publications, but decreased from 50NIHˋile to TOP50 (eight  
trials, 16.0ˋ). In terms of blinding ( Fig 3B ), the 
n
umber of blinded trials increased from LOW50

In terms of the number of trial centers ( Fig 3C ), 
the number of multi-center trials increased as the RCR increased from LOW50 (32 trials, 64.0ˋ) to TOP50 (50 trials, 100ˋ). Regarding the trial country ( Fig 3D ), the number of multi-country 
trials increased as the RCR increased from LOW50 (four trials, 8.0ˋ) to TOP50 (39 trials, 78ˋ). The number of single-country trial was highest in LOW50 (46 trials, 92ˋ), whilst most of the trials in TOP50 were multi-country trials. For trial sponsorship/support ( Fig 3E ), the num -

Figure 5  shows the proportion of statistically 
powered trials and their study outcomes. The 
number of statistically powered trials increased as RCR increased. The number of positive trials in -
creased from 50 NIHˋile (six trials, 21.4ˋ) to T
OP50 (33 trials, 67.3ˋ), but 16 trials (32.7ˋ) 
in TOP50 were negative.3. T ypes of intervention
The types of interventions in each RCR category 
are shown in Table 1 . The most common inter -
vention in LOW50 was chemotherapy-only (38 trials, 
76.0ˋ), and the number of chemotherapy-  
only trials decreased as the RCR increased from LO
W50 to TOP50 (nine trials, 18.0ˋ). The inter -
vention of 39 trials (78.0ˋ) in TOP50 included molecular tar
get drugs for NSCLC, and the number 
decreased from TOP50 to LOW50 (six trials, 12.0ˋ).
Discussion
It is known that RCTs provide stronger evi -
dence compared to non-randomized trials due to their lo
wer bias.2,3) In this study, the results 
showed that the number of non-randomized trials excluded during the publication screening de -
creased as the RCR increased: LOW50, 190 pub -
lications; 50NIHˋile, 69 publications; and T
OP50, 22 publications ( Fig 1 ). Moreover, the 
median RCR of LOW50 improved from 0.03 in the previous research, which included both RCT and non-RCTs, to 0.14 in this research only with RCT.
13) These results support that RCTs tend to

RCTs because of their stronger evidence.
The present research showed that the propor -
tion of each trial design factor changed as the RCR cate
gory changed. Especially, the proportion 
of Phase 3, multi-country, for-profit company sponsored/supported, and statistically powered 
RCTs increased more than 30 ˋ from 50NIH ˋile 
to TOP50, the subject number increased approxi -
mately four-fold from 50NIHˋile to TOP50, and 9
4ˋ of trials in TOP50 used important primary 
endpoints ( eg, overall survival or progression free 
survival). These observations indicate that the 
outcome of con/f_irmatory Phase 3 RCTs conducted 
globally by pharmaceutical companies tend to have higher scienti/f_ic in/f_luence. In new oncology drug development, a Phase 3 trial normally be -
comes a large-sized trial due to the subject num -
bers required to con/f_irm statistically pre-de/f_ined ef
ficacy differences against standard treatment. 
Moreover, global collaboration is a key to expe -
diting subject recruitment for early completion, test drugs in di
verse populations, and facilitate 
new drug applications in as many countries/  regions as possible.24) Trial outcomes derived from 
con/f_irmatory global trials represent the best evi -
dence in many regions for choosing a better treat -
ment option, and thus, the scienti/f_ic in/f_luence of the 
trial outcome would increase. In addition,  
molecular target drug interventions increased as RCR increased opposed to chemotherap
y-only 
interventions. Seventy-eight percent of interven -
tions were molecular target drugs in the TOP50, 
a
nd immune checkpoint inhibitors and ALK/ROS1 
inhibitors were tested only in the TOP50. This  
indicates that newly developed and highly effica -
cious drugs can increase the scientific influence of the trial outcome.
There were 49 (98.0
ˋ) statistically powered 
trials in TOP 50. Of them, 16 trials did not meet the primary endpoint. This result suggests, from  
a statistical perspective, that a positive outcome  
is not always required to gain higher scientific  
in/f_luence. Rather, the statistical power to con/f_irm a pre-de/f_ined dif
ference will be equally important or 
more important to gain higher scienti/f_ic in/f_luence. It is reported that the success rate of oncology RCTs was approximately 30ˋ, and in 82ˋ of negative Intervention LOW50 50NIH％ile TOP50

Because a negative outcome is not equal to l no 
evidence,z  and in fact generates important  
insights for the next hypothesis, statistical measures 
t
hat lead to conclusive outcomes will contribute 
to the progress of drug development and EBM, 
regardless of outcomes.
In contrast, most of the trials in LOW50 were 
non-Phase 3 (90.0ˋ), single-country (92.0ˋ), involved non-important endpoints ( eg, response 
rate, safety, feasibility: 74.0ˋ), and were not sta -
tistically powered for direct comparison between the interv
entions (78.0ˋ). These RCTs were de -
signed for exploratory purposes, such as to select 
b
etter doses/regimens, estimate ef/f_icacy differences 
between the interventions for the next con/f_irmatory trials, or just to compare interventions descriptively. While this type of study provides important  
information to proceed to later phase trials, or  
answers some clinical questions which physicians may ha
ve, they do not provide statistically  
conclusive results. Thus, the utility of the trial out -
come is limited, and that would limit the scienti/f_ic 
in/f_luence of the outcome.
Mos
t published TOP50 trials were sponsored/
supported by pharmaceutical companies, and some other trials were supported by the NIH or led by oncology cooperative trial groups. It has been reported that the proportion of global trials funded by industry is 10-fold higher than non-in -
dustry sponsored trials (30.3ˋ and 3.2ˋ, respec -
tively), and the lack of funding is the most critical barrier for academic clinical cancer researchers to conduct clinical research.
28, 29) Funding support 
from for-pro/f_it companies or non-pro/f_it organiza -
tions will be important for academic researchers t
o conduct large-sized, con/f_irmatory trials which 
will lead to highly in/f_luential outcomes.
Our research had several limitations. First, while several measures have been taken to en -
hance the publication of clinical trial results, not a
ll clinical trials publish their results in journals 
and there is a risk of publication bias.30, 31) This is 
an inevitable limitation of bibliometric analysis; however, it is expected that this bias will be smaller in future because advanced efforts to im -
prove the clinical trial transparency including trial 
re
gistry, result reporting and data sharing are ongo -
ing globally (https://www.jpma.or.jp/basis/rinsyo/
lofurc0000001vkc-att/polic
y18.pdf, December 13, 
2021). Second, RCR is one of the citations based 
bibliometric index, and does not directly indicate the degree of contributions to the progression  
of EBM. However, RCR is a better available  
indicator to assess the influence of individual publications compared to JIF or citation numbers. The de
velopment of better article-based biblio -
metric indicator capable of evaluating usefulness o
f the research outcome and its contribution to 
the progress of EBM is expected. Third, it was not possible to assess the degree of contribution of each factor to the increase in RCR due to cor -
relations among the study design factors. Rather than our comprehensi
ve analysis, the research  
focused on more fragmented study design or  
disease area could reveal de/f_initive factor which impact on the scienti/f_ic in/f_luence of the outcome. Finally
, our /f_indings might not be directly appli -
cable to other disease areas or interventions since w
e focused on drug intervention clinical trials in 
NSCLC patients to maintain consistency of base -
line characteristics of the study design. The re-
search by using our bibliometric approach would 
be v
aluable to identify the factors that impact on 
the scientific outcome of clinical trial in each  
disease area or intervention.
In conclusion, our research sho

tively that the clinical trial design would have ef -

come. The trial results of large-sized, multi-  
country, statistically powered con/f_irmatory RCTs 
with no
vel interventions have higher scientific  
in/f_luence. Statistical power is an equally important 
or more 
important factor than a positive RCT  
outcome to gain high scientific influence of the outcome. Outcomes of small-sized, e
xploratory, 
chemotherapy-only, and single-country RCTs tend to have lower scientific influence. Besides new drug development by pharmaceutical company, use of clinical study collaborative groups capable of conducting multi-center/country studies, acquisition of research funding from the government, and  
investigator-initiated clinical trial by collaborating 
with pharmaceutical compa
ny are one of the  
solutions to conduct highly in/f_luential trial. Phar -
maceutical companies can contribute to the con -
duct of highly influential trials by developing no
vel compounds and supporting researchers with 
funding.
