Evidence  Report – Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  About ICER  
The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review ( ICER ) is an independent, non -profit research institute that conducts 
evidence -based reviews of health care interventions, including prescription drugs, other treatments, and 
diagnostic tests. In collaboration with patients, clinical experts, and other key stak eholders, ICER analyzes the 
available evidence on the benefits and risks of these interventions to measure their value and suggest fair prices. 
ICER also regularly reports on the barriers to care for patients and recommends solutions to ensure fair access to 
prescription drugs. For more information about ICER, please visit www.icer.org . 
The funding for this report comes from non -profit foundations, with the largest single funder being the Arnold 
Ventures . No funding for this work comes from health insurers, pharmacy benefit managers  (PBMs) , or life science 
companies . ICER receives approximately 23% of its overall revenue  from these health  industry  organizations to run 
a separate Policy Summit program, with funding approximately equally split between insurers/PBMs and life 
science companies . For a complete list of funders and for more information on ICER's support, please

For drug topics, in addition to receiving recommendations from the public , ICER scans publicly available 
information and also benefits from a collaboration with IPD Analytics , an independent organization that performs 
analyses of the emerging drug pipeline for a diverse group of industry stakeholders, including payers, 
pharmaceutical manufacturers, providers, and wholesalers . IPD provides a tailored report on the drug pipeline on 
a courtesy basis to ICER but does not prioritize topics for specific ICER assessments.  
 
About the Midwest CEPAC  
The Midwest Comparative Effectiveness Public Advisory Council (Midwest CEPAC) – a core program of ICER – 
provides a public venue in which the evidence on the effectiveness and value of health care services can be 
discussed with the input of all stakeholder s. The Midwest CEPAC seeks to help patients, clinicians, insurers, and 
policymakers interpret and use evidence to improve the quality and value of health care.  
 
The Midwest CEPAC Panel is an independent committee of medical evidence experts from across Midwest, with a 
mix of practicing clinicians, methodologists, and leaders in patient engagement and advocacy. All Panel members 
meet strict conflict of interest gui delines and are convened to discuss the evidence summarized in ICER reports and 
vote on the comparative clinical effectiveness and value of medical interventions. More information about the 
Midwest CEPAC is available at https://icer.org/who -we-are/people/independent -appraisal -committees/midwest -

The findings contained within this report are current as of the date of publication . Readers should be aware that 
new evidence may emerge following the publication of this report that could potentially influence the results . ICER 
may revisit its analyses in a formal update to this report in the future.  
 
The economic models used in ICER reports are intended to compare the clinical outcomes, expected costs, and 
cost-effectiveness of different care pathways for broad groups of patients . Model results therefore represent 
average findings across patients and should not be presumed to represent the clinical or cost outcomes for any 
specific patient . In addition, data inputs to ICER models often come from clinical trials; patients in these trials may 
differ in real -world practice settings.

Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain   Return to Table of Contents  Executive Summary   
One consensus working definition of acute pain is “the physiologic response to and experience of 
noxious stimuli that can become pathologic, is normally sudden in onset, time limited, and 
motivates behaviors to avoid potential or actual tissue injury.”1 Acute pain is ubiquitous though it 
frequently does not require specific treatment . A retrospective cross -sectional study using two 
nationally representative datasets from 2019 estimated that 80.2 million patients in the US annually 
experience pain  requiring prescription medication treatment for less than three  months.2 
In the postoperative setting, many patients are treated with opioid analgesics  to manage their 
pain .3 Opioids can have important side effects including sedation, respiratory depression , confusion, 
falls, and constipation, but a primary concern with opioid prescriptions for acute pain is the risk of 
developing persistent opioid use and/or opioid use disorder (OUD).4 This risk is uncertain and can 
vary widely, in part based on the definition used and underlying patient and medication risk 
factors.5-7 It is estimated that approximately  108,000 people in the US died from opioid overdoses in 
2022 and that nearly 15,000 of those deaths involved prescription opioids.8 An analysis from 2017 
found that annual health care costs from OUD were nearly $35 billion, criminal justice costs 
(including lost productivity of those incarcerated) were $23 billion, and other lost productivity was 
more than $92 billion.9 
Given concerns about opioids, safer analgesic medications could be beneficial. Generally, however, 
nearly all other systemic analgesics used for acute pain are either nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen, and use of more than one pain medication to allow for greater 
analgesia with fewer side effects is typically recommended.3 Suzetrigine ( Journavx® ; Vertex 
Pharmaceuticals) is an oral small -molecule inhibitor of the voltage -gated sodium channel Na v1.8 
that has been studied for the treatment of acute post -surgical pain and represents a new class of 
analgesic medication.10 The drug is administered every 12 hours.  Suzetrigine was approved by the  
Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) on January 30th, 2025.11 
In this report, we assess suzetrigine as a treatment for acute pain. Suzetrigine is also being studied 
for chronic pain  but, while that may be a later indication for the drug, it is currently only approved 
by the FDA for acute pain and, as such, this report focuses only on that indication.  The evidence for 
suzetrigine comes primarily from two similar Phase III randomized trials comparing it to placebo and 
to the opioid hydrocodone 5 mg in combination with acetaminophen 325 mg  (HB5/APAP325 ; often 
known by the trade name,  “Vicodin” ); one trial included patients after bunionectomy and the other 
after abdominoplasty.  Across the two trials, 873 patients received suzetrigine, 879 patients received 
HB5/APAP325, and 439 patients received placebo.  Patients treated with suzetrigine had greater and 
faster reductions in pain than those treated with placebo.  Suzetrigine appeared to have similar 
efficacy to HB5/APAP 325 for abdominoplasty, but slower on set of clinically meaningful pain relief 
 
©Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 202 5 Page ES 2 
Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain   Return to Table of Contents  for bunionectomy . Adverse effects of suzetrigine were similar to placebo and nause a appeared less 
common than with HB5/APAP325.  
We also conducted a network meta -analysis to compare  suzetrigine to higher -dose oral opioid s and 
to NSAIDs, both with or without acetaminophen.  Confidence intervals were widely overlapping,  
making it hard to come to definite conclusions about relative efficacy.  Rates of development of OUD 
after short -term administration of opioids for acute pain are uncertain , as are rates o f NSAID 
adverse effects (e.g., acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal bleeding, acute coronary syndrome)  when 
used in the pos t-operative  setting.  
We have some uncertainties in assessing the efficacy of suzetrigine because of lack of data on use 
of rescue medication in the  Phase III trials as well as uncertainties  that are inherent whe n pain 
scores are imputed after rescue medication.  This information is likely to become available when the 
trials are published. Additionally, for comparison with opioids,  the dose of HB/APAP used in the 
clinical trials was lower and administration every six hours was less frequent than many patients 
would be treated wit h postoperatively . We have concerns about as -yet-unknow n harms of 
suzetrigine as we would for any drug with a new mechanism of action ; we are particularly 
concerned about  possible  acute  renal injury given the results of a study in people with diabetes ,12 
and have  some concerns as to whether there could be an increased risk for cardiac arrhythmias 
given inhibition of Na v1.8. 
The above uncertainties inform our ratings that the evidence for suzetrigine  for the treatment of 
acute pain  in comparison with no systemic treatment, in comparison with opioid analgesics, and in 
comparison with NSAIDs are all promising but inconclusive ( P/I). Our reasoning for these ratings 
differs for each comparison and is discussed in detail in Section 3.3 along with consideration of 
which patients might be more appropriate for early treatment with suzetrigine . As safety data 
become available with real world use, assessment of net benefit is likely to change.  
We conducted an economic analysis that modeled the long -term cost -effectiveness of one week of 
treatment with suzetrigine  compared with HB5/APAP325  using a wholesale acquisition cost  (WAC)  
for suzetrigine of $15.50 per tablet or $232.50  for a one-week course. The model was primarily 
driven by risks of OUD from this short course of an opioid analgesic . Due to  the lifetime costs and 
harms of OUD, and assuming a wide range of estimates of OUD risk, treating with suzetrigine would 
be slightly cost-saving relative to opioid therapy while  producing greater health benefits  
(“dominant”).  We estimate that suzetrigine , at its WAC price , would meet commonly used  cost-
effectiveness thresholds  if a one -week course of treatment with opioids results in an excess of at 
least two in 10,000 cases of  OUD  over the subsequent three years .

Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  1. Background   
While definitions and estimates of prevalence vary, one consensus working definition of acute pain 
is “the physiologic response to and experience of noxious stimuli that can become pathologic, is 
normally sudden in onset, time limited, and motivates behaviors to avoid potential or actual tissue 
injury.”1 The meaning of “time limited” also varies, and in the prior working definition the following 
was noted: acute pain typically lasts up to seven days; prolongations up to 30 days are common; 
prolongations beyond 90 days reflect chronic pain; between 30 and 90 days, pain may be 
“subacute” but this is not well defined.1 
Acute pain is ubiquitous though it frequently does not require specific treatment or drug therapy. In 
medical care settings, pain is particularly common. In a series of surgical patients, only 10% had no 
pain, while 12% had severe -to-extreme pain at discharge and 54% had moderate -to-severe pain at 
discharge.13 Pain is also common in emergency department settings and on inpatient medical 
services.14,15 A retrospective cross -sectional study using two nationally representative datasets from 
2019 estimated that 80.2 million patients in the U S annually experience pain  requiring prescription 
medication treatment for less than three  months.2 
In the postoperative setting, many patients are treated with opioid analgesics.3 Opioids can have 
important side effects including sedation, respiratory depression , confusion, falls, and constipation, 
but a primary concern with opioid prescriptions for acute pain is the risk of developing persistent 
opioid use and/or opioid use disorder (OUD).4 This risk is uncertain and can vary widely, in part 
based on the definition used and underlying patient and medication risk factors.5-7 A series in 
surgical patients found that 3.1% of patients who had not previously used opioids continued to use 
opioids for more than 90 days after major elective surgery.16 However, this does not distinguish 
between continued use due to continued pain and continued use because of OUD.  
It is estimated that approximately  108,000 people in the US  died from opioid overdoses in 2022 and 
that nearly 15,000 of those deaths involved prescription  opioids.8 However, the number of deaths 
involving prescription opioids has been generally decreasing since 2017.17 An analysis from 2017 
found that  annual  health care costs from OUD were  nearly $35 billion, criminal justice costs  
(including lost productivity of those incarcerated) were $23 billion, and other lost productivity was 
more than $92 billion.9

Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  2. Patient  and Carer Perspectives   
While many patients and patient groups are more focused on issues around chronic pain, w e heard 
from multiple s takeholders about  the need for safer medications to treat moderate -to-severe acute 
pain . We also heard that concerns around opioids are leading to undertreatment of acute pain in 
some patients who could benefit from short courses of opioids, but also heard that because opioids 
are inexpensive and widely available, they continue to be overused in other settings.  Overall, 
though, we heard that the frequency with which opioids are being prescribed and the number of 
doses being prescribed have both dramatically decreased over t he past decade.  
We heard widely differing views on the risk of OUD  after limited treatment with opioids. Some 
stakeholders emphasized individual anecdotes rela ted by patients or their families where addiction 
seemed to occur after a single dose of an opioid medication. Others stressed that studies suggest 
very low rates of opioid addiction in patients given less than a week of treatment.  We also heard 
about fear of addiction among patients and their caregivers. We spoke with one patient with recent 
acute pain who, despite receiving good pain relief with opioids after various surgeries, and despite 
having no side effects from opioids or difficulties with discontinuation, would have preferred a 
medication with no addiction risk even if it were somewhat less effective for pain  control.  
We heard that different types of pain elicit different responses and that this has implications for 
functioning during pain. The example was provided of different types of headaches where patients 
with migraine  try to limit activity while patients with cluster headache tend to pace . 
We heard from patients and clinicians that  there are a limited number of  options for treating acute 
pain, and so expanding the “toolbox” would be beneficial.  We heard that some of the  concerns with 
the use  of opioids  that are unrelated to OUD , such as sedation, can be beneficial in patients with 
severe time -limited causes of pain, and that adverse effects of opioids, including confusion and 
constipation, can be particular ly problematic for some groups of patients such as older patients. We 
also heard about the problems with NSAIDs , which can also be worse in older patients, including 
risks for gastrointestinal bleeding, re nal injury, and myocardial infarction.  
We heard that education for patients around appropriate use of opioid pain medication may reduce 
the risk of developing OUD. For instance, counseling that opioids should only be used when other 
medications are not sufficiently effective.  
We heard th at education for providers around the efficacy of multimodal pain management would 
improve clinical decision making and outcomes.

Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  We heard that inadequate treatment for acute pain can lead to patients seeking emergency care 
that is time -consuming for the patient , resource -intensive for the health  care system, and costly for 
all involved.  
We heard that the availability  of additional pain medication options may be particularly important 
for patients with a prior history of OUD. In such patients, even short courses of opioids can lead to 
recurrence of OUD.  However, we also heard from a patient with chronic pain who reports long -term 
benefits with opioid treatment without development of OUD . This patient felt that only opioid 
treatment allowed them to function.  
Multiple stakeholders described that having a n oral  medication that is more potent than NSAIDs 
would provide an option for treatment that currently is really only filled by opioids. There was hope 
that suzetrigine might bridge this efficacy gap.  
The individual p atients we spoke with described mixed experiences with post -surgery pain 
management in the setting of having chronic pain. One patient faced issues with inadequate pain 
control and hesitancy from nurses to provide sufficient opioid medication, while another patient 
had good res ults using oxycodone and other medications with effective pain relief and limited side 
effects. Both of these  patients expressed openness to exploring non -opioid pain management 
alternatives that could provide similar benefits without the risks of addiction.  
Health Equity Considerations  
We heard a number of health equity concerns from patient groups and providers:  
• As discussed above, we heard that because opioids are inexpensive and widely available, in 
some underserved settings they may be preferentially prescribed, placing underserved 
patients at higher risk of developing OUD than is warranted.  In contrast, we also heard that 
pain is less adequately managed  in racial and ethnic minorit y groups  and that  patients from 
such groups are less likely to be pre scribed opioid  medications even when these 
medications would be app ropriate.  
• We heard of concerns that undertreatment of pain may relate to clinician implicit or explicit 
bias, including concerns around  pain tolerance and OUD risk  in specific patient groups, and 
that education to improve cultural competency in providers is needed.  We heard that 
stigma around risk of OUD in specific patient groups may affect both provider willingness to 
prescribe opioids and patient willingness to be treated with opioids.  
• We heard that underserved communities are less likely to have access to multimodal pain 
management  that may include physical therapy, regional anesthesia, and/or nerve blocks.  
This may occur for economic reasons and because of limited local availability of such 
therapies.

Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  • We heard that undertreatment of pain can have important short -term and long -term 
psychological consequences including anxiety, depression, and ongoing mental health 
challenges.  
• We heard that pain medi cation side effects may be particularly problematic for older 
individuals and for those with disabilities .

Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  3. Comparative Clinical Effectiveness   
3.1. Methods Overview  
Procedures for the systematic literature review are described in  Supplement D1 . A research 
protocol was published on Open Science Framework  and is registered with PROSPERO 
(CRD42024577939 ).  
Scope of Review  
We aimed to  assess  the clinical effectiveness and safety of suzetrigine as an add -on to non -systemic  
treatments for patients  with moderate to severe acute pain, and compare the therapy to receiving 
no systemic therapy for pain  (as represented by placebo arms in clinical trials ), non -opioid 
analgesics (including NSAIDs, acetaminophen, or a combination of both), or opioid analgesics alone 
or in combination with acetaminophen.  
The scope of review  examined  patient -important outcomes that included pain contr ol, physical 
functioning,  patient -assessed quality of life, and short and long -term adverse events. The full scope 
of our review is provided in Supplement D1 .  
Evidence Base  
Our evidence base for this review included  five clinical trials within the suzetrigine clinical 
development portfolio : two pivotal trials, NAVIGATE -1 and NAVIGATE -2; one single -arm Phase III 
trial; and two Phase II trials.10,18 Four of the trials provided direct evidence of the comparative 
clinical effectiveness and safety of suzetrigine against placebo and hydrocodone bitartrate 5 
mg/acetaminophen 325 mg (HB5/APAP325) . Study results from NAVIGATE -1 and 2 are not currently 
presented in a peer -reviewed article and were accessed as a conference presentation  that was 
given  during the annual American Society of Anesthe siolog ists conference in October 2024. Other 
than for examining harms, we  excluded data from the lower suzetrigine doses tested in Phase II 
trials since these doses were not carried  forward to Phase III trials.  
NAVIGATE -1 and 2 were Phase III trials that evaluated the efficacy and safety of suzetrigine oral 
tablets (100  mg then 50  mg every 12 hours ) in adults  who underwent bunionectomy and 
abdomin oplasty  procedures,  respectively . Patients were eligible for the se stud ies if they had post -
operative acute pain  that was moderate or severe ( a score of four  or greater out of ten on the 
Numeri c Pain  Rating  Scale  [NPRS ]; see Supplement A1  for additional definitions).  Suzetrigine was 
administered  as a post -operative a nalgesic and compared against  a combination capsule of 
HB5/APAP 325 as well as placebo , both administered every six hours . In the bunionectomy trial, 
patients received randomized treatment within nine  hours after resolution  of a popliteal sciatic

Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  nerve block with ropivacaine. Ropivacaine is a local anesthetic that inhibits sodium channels less 
selectively than suzetrigine, a targeted Na v1.8 channel inhibitor.19 Trial participants were assessed 
on the drug’s impact on pain intensity as measured by the NPRS and  time -weighted sum of the pain 
intensity difference from 0 to 48 hours following surgery  (SPID48). SPID48  calculates the difference 
in pain scores at prespecified time points versus baseline score and is cumulative for all 
measurements taken within the follow -up period of 48 years. A greater  SPID48  value represents 
greater reduction in pain intensity . Suzetrigine was also studied in a single -arm trial in a broader 
population that included  patients undergoing different types of surgery (e.g ., orthopedic , plastic) as 
well as  non-surgical pain.  
We conducted a network meta -analysis (NMA) to compare  suzetrigine to higher -dose oral opioid s 
and to NSAIDs, both with or without acetaminophen.  This analysis included an additional eight  
randomized controlled trials  and seven  interventions . (Supplement D 2.3 for Baseline 
Characteristics) (Supplement D2  for additional NMA analysis details)

Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  Evaluation of Clinical Trial Diversity  
We rated the demographic diversity (race/ethnicity, sex, age) of the participants in the pivotal 
suzetrigine trials using the ICER -developed Clinical trial Diversity Rating (CDR) Tool  (Table 3.2) .20 See 
Supplement D1  for full details of CDR methods and results.  
Table. 3. 2. Diversity Ratings on Race and Ethnicity, Sex, and Age (Older Adults)  
Trial  Race and Ethnicity  Sex Age (Older Adults)  
NAVIGATE -1 Poor  Poor  Not Rated  
NAVIGATE -2 Poor  Poor  Not Rated  
 
Race and Ethnicity: The pivotal trials achieved adequate representation of White and Black/African 
American participants relative to US census data and surgery -specific prevalence estimates.  
However, the trials received a Poor rating (6/12 points) due to insufficient reporting of Asian and 
Hispanic/Latino participant demographics.  
Sex: Most participants in both trials were women (85 -98%). While this matches the typical gender 
ratio for these elective surgeries (abdominoplasty and bunionectomy), the drug is intended to treat 
acute pain - a condition that affects men and women equally. Due  to this underrepresentation of 
men, both trials received a Poor rating in this category  when compared to US census data . 
Age: Neither  trial report ed the proportion of trial participants that were ≥65 years old  and were 
not rated on this c ategory . 
3.2. Results  
Clinical Benefits  
Reduction In Pain  
Post -surgery, patients were assessed  on the intensity of their pain  using the NPRS . This score was  
presented in several formats  across the randomized controlled trials : a time -weighted sum of the 
pain intensity difference from 0 to 48 hours (SPID48) was the primary efficacy endpoint . Other 
measurements took the form of a mean change in NPRS from baseline, a time -to-event  analysis of a 
drop of  two points on the NPRS, and the proportion  of patients that achieved a 30, 50, and 70% 
reduction in pain . In the single -arm study, trial participants were assessed  on the drug’s perceived 
efficacy on managing  pain via the Patient Global Assessment over 14 days of treatment and on 
adverse events over 28 days.  
 
©Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 202 5 Page 9 
Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  Suzetrigine versus No System ic Therapy  (Placebo)  
Patients treated with suzetrigine had a higher  SPID48  (greater reduction in pain over 48 hours)  than 
those in the placebo arm in both the bunionectomy and abdom inoplasty trials  (Table 3. 3). When 
patients took rescue medication (ibuprofen) for additional pain relief, their SPID48 scores were 
imputed for six hours afterward  using  the last observation carried forward  approach . This means 
that if a trial participant took ibuprofen, their most recent pain score was used as a placeholder for 
the next six hours of data collection, assuming no change in pain levels.  Analysis showed that 
including the pain -relieving effects of ibuprofen (without imputation) resulted in higher SPID48 
values in both the suzetrigine and placebo groups. Suzetrigine demonstrated statistically significant 
improvement in SPID48 compared to placebo.  
In both  trials, suzetrigine had a more rap id onset of clinically meaningful pain relief via  decrease  in 
the NPRS of two points or greater. In the abdominoplasty  trial, it took patients treated with 
suzetrigine a median of approximately two hours to achieve a ≥2 decrease  in NPRS, versus a median 
of eight  hours for placebo. Patients in the post -bunionectomy population achieved a ≥2 decrease  in 
NPRS  within a median of four  hours in the suzetrigine arm versus eight  hours in the placebo arm.   
The proportion s of patients who  achieved a 30, 50, and 70% reduction in pain  were  not publicly 
reported in the current presentation of NAVIGATE -1 and 2 trial evidence. A 30% reduction in pain is 
generally considered clinically meaningful, although there is no universally agreed upon 
threshold.21-23 In previous Phase II trials, a higher percentage of patients in the suzetrigine group 
reached th is threshold compared to the placebo group: 61% versus 48% for abdominoplasty, and 
83% versus 68% for bunionectomy.  
In a separate single -arm trial that evaluated suzetrigine's effectiveness across both surgical and 
non-surgical pain conditions over 14 days  of follow -up, 83% of the 256 participants rated the 
treatment as good, very good, or excellent using  the Patient Global Assessment .

The efficacy of suzetrigine was compared to hydrocodone bitartrate 5  mg/acetaminophen 325  mg 
(HB5/APAP325) as a secondary outcome in the NAVIGATE -1 and 2 trials. HB5/APAP325 was superior 
to suze trigine in the bunionectomy trial in the imputed analysis of monotherapy but this difference 
was not statistically significant when analyzed data includ ed rescue therapy with ibuprofen (Table 
3.3). No statistically significant differences were seen  in the abdominoplasty trial. Of note, although 
non-inferiority margin s were not specified, it does not appear that these trials were powered a 
priori  as non -inferiority trials.  A time -to-event  pain reduction  analysis comparing suzetrigine and 
HB5/APAP325 was not reported .

Suzetrigine versus Higher Dose Opioids  
In typical  clinical practice of treating moderate to severe acute pain, pat ients may receive opioid 
doses that are more potent than what was studied in the suzetrigine clinical trials.24 We evaluated 
the comparative efficacy of suzetrigine to doses of opioids greater than HB5/APAP325 via a network  
meta -analysis. The higher dose opioids in the network were pooled using SPID48 values from their 
respective trials  and included study arms such as  oxycodone 15  mg/acetaminophen 650  mg every 
12 hours  and HB/APAP 7.5/325  mg every four  to six hours  (Supplement Table D2.2 for all included 
interventions ).  
Table 3. 5 provides an overview of the calculated effect sizes (Cohen’s D ) between  the analgesic 
classes . A higher effect size value indicates a greater difference  between two groups on the SPID48  
and greater magnitude of pain relief . Suzetrigine showed similar effectiveness to opioids in treating 
moderate to severe acute pain, with no statistically significant differences between treatments ; 
however , confidence intervals were wide . A general rule of thumb for interpreting Cohen's D values 
is that 0.20, 0.50 , and 0.80 represent small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively.25 When 
compared to placebo, suzetrigine demonstrated a modest benefit, with an effect size of 0.4 3.

Standardized mean differences greater than 0 favor the column -defining treatment. Significant results are in bold.  
Suzetrigine versus NSAIDs  
Nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAID)  are a class of drugs that are commonly used in 
combination with acetaminophen as a  multimodal  non-opioid alternative to treating moderate to 
severe acute pain. Given the absence of NSAIDs  as comparators  in the suzetrigine clinical 
development program, we conducted an indirect comparison between suzetrigine and NSAID s as a 
drug class on reduction in pain intensity as measured by SPID48. The list of NSAIDs included several 
formulations and dosages of diclofenac, indomethacin , and celecoxib  (Supplement Table D2.2  for 
full list of interventions ). 
Based on  indirect evidence from the network  meta -analysis , suzetrigine showed comparable 
effectiveness to NSAIDs in reducing pain intensity ; however , confidence intervals were wide  (Table 
3.5).  
Other Outcomes  
We sought information on suzetrigine’s impact on other patient -important outcomes, including 
quality of life, physica l functioning  and interference in activities of daily living , development of 
chronic pain, use of rescue medication, and opioid avoidance.  
In its clinical development program  for acute pain , the manufacturer of suzetrigine did not include a 
measure ment tool that assessed a patient’s physical  (e.g., ability to maintain movement and 
activities of daily living)  and mental  (e.g., anxiety)  quality of life, which are important dimensions of 
pain when making treatment decisions.26

Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  The percentage of trial participants who required rescue medication (ibuprofen) was a measured 
outcome that was used to impute SPID48 scores , but the percentages themselves  were not 
currently reported in either Phase II or III trials.  While opioids  are commonly  used as rescue 
medi cation in t rials evaluating  non-opioid interventions  (e.g., NSAIDs ), they were not permitted as 
rescue medication in th ese studies. Therefore,  the o pioid -sparing effects of suzetrigine  compared to  
NSAIDs  could not be assessed.  
Given the short duration  of its trials ( two days for efficacy, 14  days  for safety) , we were not able to 
assess whether suzetrigine has any impact on the likeli hood of patients with acute pain progressing 
into chronic pain .  
Harms  
Due to identical study designs and duration  of safety data collection  (14±2 days after last dose) , we 
pooled the safety data of the four Phase II and III trial s of suzetrigine  (Table 3. 6). Overall, suzetrigine 
appears to be a tolerable analge sic with a favorable safety profile. The rate of disconti nuation due 
to adverse events was less than one percent across all study arms.  Most adver se events were mild 
or moderate in severity. The two known life -threatening adverse events that occurred  in the 
suzetrigine study arm, pulmonary embolism and anemia , were  not considered to be treatment -
related .  
As expected, t he incidence of nau sea and vomiting was numerically higher  with  HB/APAP than with 
suzetrigine , although measures of statistical significance were not reported.  Other reported adverse 
events were similar between suzetrigine and HB/APAP.  
In addition to the four randomized controlled trials , suzetrigine was studied in a single -arm trial  
(N=256)  and reported adverse events over a period of 28 ±2 days . Approximately two percent of 
participants discontinued suzetrigine treatment due to an adver se event. These events included 
accidental overdose, arrhythmia, nausea, rash, and somnolence ; all except the case of arrythmia 
were resolved by end of study.  
Due to the short -term duration of all suzetrigine trials, we cannot determine the longer -term 
impact of extended use on the drug’s  safety  profile .

Qualitative Overview of Harms of Short -term Use of Opioid s and NSAIDs  
Harms of Short -Term Opioid Use  
Opioids are not recommended as first -line therapy for many common acute pain conditions such as 
low back pain, neck pain, and headaches  (See  Supplement Section C  for additional Clinical Guideline 
recommendations) .27 Compared to NSAIDs or acetaminophen, opioids are associated with 
increased risks of short -term adverse events including nausea, dizziness, and somnolence.27 Nausea 
and vomiting have been identified  by patients  as the  two most impactful  adverse events associated 
with opioid use, with a lesser impact from constipation.28 Opioid prescriptions for older adults 
require special consideration due to less predictable treatment effects  compared to younger 
patients  and a higher risk of medication reactions due to greater polypharmacy .29 
Additionally, observational studies have found that opioid use for acute low back pain or 
postoperative pain is associated with an increased likelihood of developing long -term opioid use, 
with the risk being greater with higher initial dosages and longer d urations of exposure.27 
 
 
©Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 202 5 Page 15 
Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  Harms of Short -Term NSAID Use  
Treatment with NSAIDs  carries risks of serious harms including gastrointestinal bleeding, acute 
kidney injury, and cardiovascular events .30 Risk for adverse gastrointestinal toxicity increases with 
age, NSAID dose, duration of treatment , prior history of ulcer , and certain concurrent  medication 
use.31,32 Risk for acute kidney injury increases with age and with severity  of chronic kid ney 
disease.33,34 Risk for cardiovascular events increases with traditional cardiovascular risk factors, 
NSAID dose, and frequency of NSAID use.35 
Although NSAID administration is associated with acute kidney injury during a medical admission ,36 
data on the exact risk of these harms when NSAIDs are used for postoperative pain are limited.37 
For example, in a trial of intravenous ibuprofen  for postoperative pain , serious adverse events were 
uncommon and similar in the intervention and placebo groups.38 Similar lack of differences in 
treatment -related adverse events was seen in a trial comparing diclofenac, ketorolac, and 
placebo.39 However, these trials were relatively small  and thus unlikely to detect low frequency 
harms.  
Uncertainty and Controversies  
• We currently only have top -line results from  the Phase III trials of suzetrigine.  In the 
absence of the full  peer -reviewed  publication , we are uncertain  what was considered a 
priori  to be meaningful pain reduction. This would be particularly helpful to know , since the 
comparison with placebo should show improvement  beyond a mini mum cl inically important 
difference (MCID), and the comparison with  HB/APAP  could be assessed for noninferiority 
using that same MCID.  
• A peer -reviewed publication would also allow better assessment of the primary outcome of 
the Phase III trials that imputed pain scores in patients who received rescue medication. 
Such imputation is potentially fraught, and needs careful review.40 
• The timing of pain reduction was d elayed w ith suzetrigine in patients who underwent 
bunionectomy. Although it was hypothesized that this may reflect ongoing  pain reduction 
with the non -selective sodium channel inhibito r ropivacaine  (a related mechanism to that of 
suzetrigine ) that had been administered for nerve block ,41 it is possible that suzetrigine pain 
relief may be slow for some types of pain. This may require additional study.

Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  • Important adverse events are detected frequently after approval and marketing of novel 
therapeutic agents,42 and we necessarily have concerns about potentially as -yet-undetected 
risks with suzetrigine . If approved, suzetrigine would be the first medication targeting 
Na v1.8, and thus has a novel mechanism of action. We note the following as concerns that 
can arise with a new mechanism of action:  
o Na v1.8 is encoded by the gene SCN10A.43 Brugada Syndrome is an inherited 
condition that can result in life -threatening cardiac arrhythmias.44 Mutations in the 
SCN10A  gene have been estimated to be involved in more than 15% of cases of 
Brugada Syndrome.45,46 The postulated mechanism by which the mutation s may 
cause Brugada Syndrome  involves interaction s with  a different sodium channel, 
Na v1.5.46 This is at least somewhat reassuring that an inhibitor of Na v1.8 might not 
affect  the risk of Brugada Syndrome . Additionally, animal studies  have not shown 
evidence of adverse cardiac effects.47 
o A Phase II trial studying various doses of  suzetrigine for 12 weeks  in patients with 
diabetic neuropat hy apparently found decreased creatinine clearance  in six of 55  
patients in the group treated with 69 mg daily .12 We have limited information about 
this, including the degree of renal dysfunction . Additionally, this use of suzetrigine  
for 12 weeks  for chronic pain  is distinct from  use for 48 hours or for seven  days  for 
acute pain , and it is possible that this adverse event was due to random chance 
given  that multiple doses and potential adverse events were studied . However, 
patients with diabetes are at increased risk of kidney injury ,48 and if  suzetrigine 
caused kidney injury, it occurred at a lower total daily dosage than is being studied 
for acute pain.  
• As is typically the case in studies  of medications for post -operative pain, t he trials allowed 
treatment with a rescue medication , in this case ibuprofen. Data on rescue medication use 
are not yet available , which makes it difficult to determine  how much of the effect may be 
due to rescue treatment.  As an example, a patient treated with a  relatively  ineffective 
medication  for pain who quickly seeks rescue treatment with a very effective medication 
might appear to have better pain relief than a patient treated with a moderately effective 
pain medication who  delays requesting or never requests the highly effective rescue 
medication.  
• The dose of HB/APAP used in the clinical trial s was lower  and administration every six hours  
was less frequent  than many patients would be treated with post operatively.  Although we 
attempted to compare  suzetrigine to higher doses of opioids using quantitative indirect 
methods, the results have wide confidence intervals , making it difficult to ascertain  the 
relative efficacy of suzetrigine to opioid analgesics.

Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  • There is uncertainty about the risk of OUD in patients who are treated with a short course  of 
opioid analgesics  in a post -operative setting. There is also uncertainty about the risk of 
specific harms from NSAIDs in this setting.  
• There were relatively few men in the trials of suzetrigine. Although we do not anticipate 
gender differences with either the benefits or harms of suzetrigine, this will be important  to 
evaluate in real world use.  
 
Additional Stakeholder Input  
Many clinicians, including pain specialists and emergency physicians, tended to think of treatment 
of acute pain while the patient was being actively seen in a clinical facility. In those settings, all 
emphasized multimodality management of pain. Such mana gement was seen as limiting the need 
for opioid medication and potentially lowering the risk of patients developing chronic pain. We 
heard of pain services integrated into emergency department management , where patients could 
be treated with regional nerve blocks using agents with extended duration of action in an attempt 
to mitigate symptoms on the days when pain would be expected to be most intense.

An explanation of the ICER Evidence Rating Matrix (Figure 3. 1) is provided here . 
Figure 3. 1. ICER Evidence Rating Matrix  
 
We have uncertainties about the efficacy and safety of suzetrigine that affect our evidence ratings  
against the three comparator options: no systemic therapy; opioid -containing analgesics; and 
NSAIDs.  How these uncertainties  apply to each comparison are different, however, and also 
potentially affect patient groups who might be appropriate  to receive suzetrigine before more 
extensive information becomes available from real world use. We discuss each comparison in turn:  

 
©Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 202 5 Page 19 
Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  • No systemic therapy : Suzetrigine clearly has some efficacy for post -operative pain relief 
although, as discussed above, our understanding of that efficacy is somewhat limited by as -
yet-unavailable information from the Phase III trials on use of rescue medication a s well as 
uncertainties inherent with imputation of results.  Also as discussed above, we have 
concerns around safety  with therapies that have a new mechanism of action . We heard 
from clinical experts that multi -modal approaches to pain that use non -systemic treatments 
are often adequate  for pain relief, but also that they are excited for the possibility of a new 
class of medication for pa in. While awaiting additional data on safety, we  feel that in 
comparison with no systemic therapy, the evidence for suzetrigine  in the treatment of 
patients with acute pain  is promising but inconclusive ( P/I). Patients for whom earlier use of 
suzetrigine might be appropriate include those who are not candidates for other systemic 
therapies  and for whom expert multimodal pain control is unavailable or not sufficiently 
effective . 
• Opioid analgesics : The relative efficacy of suzetrigine to opioid analgesics dosed as they 
typically are outside of a clinical trial, with increasing doses of opioids for patients who have 
ongoing pain, is uncertain.  Opioids can have the additional benefit in the early post -
operative setting of providing sedation.  Minor side effects of opioids are common, and the 
risk of OUD after short -term use is uncertain.  While awaiting additional data on the safety 
and efficacy  of suzetrigine , we feel that in compariso n with opioids , the evidence  in the 
treatment of patients with acute pain  is promising but inconclusive ( P/I). Patients for whom 
earlier use of suzetrigine might be appropriate include those who are not candidates for 
NSAIDs (such as those with allergies to NSAIDs) and who are at high  risk for opioid -related   
harms . These potentially include elderly post -operative patients and particularly patients 
with a history of or at an otherwise  increased risk of OUD  who are currently not using 
opioids.  
• NSAIDs : The relative efficacy of suzetrigine and NSAIDs is uncertain  and would likely require 
a randomized trial to assess.  NSAIDs have important safety  considerations, and these must 
be considered in comparison with uncertain risks with suzetrigine. Some risks with NSAIDs 
are greater in the elderly and in those with known cardiovascular (CV) disease, but this 
overlaps with some of our uncertainties around risks for arrhythmias with suzetrigine. Our 
concerns are heightened by prior experience with  a medicat ion that was felt to be safer 
than standard NSAIDs,  the COX -2 inhibitor  rofecoxib.  Rofecoxib was approved by the FDA in 
1999, was widely prescribed, and was withdrawn from the market in 2004 because of 
concerns around CV harms.49 While awaiting additional data on the safety of suzetrigine, we 
feel that in comparison with NSAIDs , the evidence  in the treatment of patients with acute 
pain  is promising but inconclusive ( P/I). Patients for whom earlier use of suzetrigine might 
be appropriate include  those at high risk for non -renal, non-CV harms of NSAIDs such as 
patients with prior gastrointestinal bleeding.

Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents   
Subgroup Analyses and Heterogeneity  
Patients in the abdomin oplasty (NAVIGATE -2) trial had a higher average pain intensity at baseline 
than those in the bunionectomy (NAVIGATE -1) trial, 7.4 versus 6.8 on the NPRS.18 A subgroup 
analysis was conducted in the NAVIGATE -1 trial to evaluate whether there was any difference in 
onset of clinically meaningful pain relief between suzetrigine and placebo in patients with a greater 
baseline pain intensity (NPRS ≥6  ; mean baseline NPRS of 7.7). The median time to a ≥2 drop in 
NPRS in the suzetrigine arm was 115 minutes, shorter than the 240 minutes seen in the overall 
population and nearly identical to the 119 minutes found in the overall abdomin oplasty population. 
This median time was significantly shorter than placebo (480 minutes) and the treatment advantage 
was maintained in patients who us ed ibuprofen as rescue medication.  
Typical subgroup analyses of treatment effect by gender, race, and age were not reported. Given 
the low percentage of male trial participants in either pivotal trial (1.8% abdomin oplasty and 15% 
bunionectomy), there may be greater  uncertainty regarding  the efficacy and safety of suzetrigine in 
a male population ; however , we have no particular reason to expect differences in efficacy based 
on patient sex .

Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  4. Long -Term Cost Effectiveness   
4.1. Methods Overview  
The aim of this analysis was to estimate the cost  effectiveness of suzetrigine compared to HB/APAP  
for moderate -to-severe acute pain using a two -phase decision analytic model.  We developed a de 
novo  decision analytic model for this evaluation, informed by key clinical trials and prior relevant 
economic models.  
 
The m odel w as split into an up -front short -term decision tree (<3 months) to reflect use of acute 
pain medications , followed by a Markov model with an annual cycle to account for lifetime 
outcomes from adverse effects of HB/APAP ( Figure 4.1). The decision tree w as used to estimate 
health related quality of life differences from  pain intensity between suzetrigine and HB/APAP 
during one short -course prescription (i.e., one week) . The Markov model w as used to compare 
lifetime outcomes between treatment arms. Specifically, we estimated  the lifetime adverse effects 
from OUD (i.e., moving from decision tree to Markov health state 2 [M2] in Figure 4.1) on direct and 
indirect health care costs, indirect non -health costs (e.g., criminal justice system costs), quality of 
life, and survival against lifetime outcomes without OUD (i.e., moving from decision tree to Markov 
health state 1 [M1] in Figure 4.1) using unrelated health care costs, quality of life, and average 
survival for the general US population. The OUD health state w as characterized by excess costs, 
reduced survival, and decreased quality of life. The “abstinence” health state include d ongoing 
medication -assisted therapy  (MAT ) costs , improved quality of life compared to the OUD state 
though still below that of the general population  not diagnosed with OUD , and an improved 
mortality rate  compared to OUD, though still an excess mortality versus the general population not 
diagnosed with  OUD . Abstinence was defined  to be  consistent with practice guidelines , which 
include the use of FDA -approved medications for the treatment of substance use disorder and 
restraint from pathological pursuit of reward and/or relief that involves the use of substances and 
other behaviors.17 We discounted costs and outcomes at 3% per year. The model was built in 
Microsoft Excel. Additional details can be found in the Supplement .

In response  to public comments and a recently released price for suzetrigine, changes to the 
economic evaluation between the Draft Report and the revised Evidence Report include:  
• Updated wholesale acquisition cost for suzetrigine  and corresponding base -case results, 
sensitivity analyses (i.e., tornado diagram specific to costs  and probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis ), updated Scenario Analysis 2  (i.e., t he proportion of patients with OUD in the 
opioid comparator arm that results in scenarios for suzetrigine that meet commonly cited 
cost-effectiveness thresholds ), and additional text in  the Uncertainty and C ontroversies  
section.  
 
4.2. Key Model Assumptions and Inputs  
Our model included several key assumptions  (Table 4.1) and inputs (Table 4.2).  Additional details 
can be found in the  Supplement . 
 
 
 
 
 

 
©Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 202 5 Page 23 
Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  Table 4.1. Key Model Assumptions  
Assumption  Rationale  
The model focused on acute pain requiring up to one 
week of prescription pain medication , such as 
surgery or other acute events causing pain, and did 
not include treatment for sub -acute or chronic pain.  The Food and Drug Administration label for suzetrigine 
is consistent with acute pain treated over short 
intervals of time .  
The proportion of patients allocated to OUD from the 
suzetrigine arm equal ed 0%. There is no evidence that patients in the initial acute 
pain phase will switch to opioids as a subsequent 
treatment and therefore we model ed the risk of OUD 
in the opioid arm only. This assumption can be relaxed 
with future evidence on treatment switching.  
There is no further transition to OUD after three 
years.  The best available evidence reports  the three -year 
incidence of OUD following an acute pain episode.  
Adverse effects from opioid use were modeled over a 
lifetime.  Lifetime modeling of OUD allow ed for capturing the 
delayed risk that can occur well after initial treatment 
and can affect patients' long -term outcomes.  
A weighted average of quality of life for OUD  was 
estimated for those seeking OUD treatment and 
those not seeking OUD treatment.  Untreated OUD significantly impacts quality of life; 
therefore, it was crucial to account for the health 
losses experienced by those not receiving treatment 
to reflect real -world outcomes.  
Consistent with long -term evidence on OUD 
(sustained five -year abstinence), a proportion of 
patients transition ed to opioid abstinence without 
the chance of moving back to the OUD health state.  Long -term studies indicate that a significant 
proportion of patients with OUD can achieve 
sustained abstinence over five years or more, 
substantially reducing the risk of relapse to active 
OUD.50,51  
For individuals in the abstinence state, ongoing 
medication -assisted treatment was assumed.  Evidence suggests opioid use disorder relapse rates 
are over 90% six months after discontinuing 
medication -assisted treatment.52 Therefore, we 
assume d MAT will continue in the abstinent state.

Clinical Inputs  
Evidence on treatment response  was derived from top -line Phase III clinical trial results announced 
by Vertex .62 
Transition Probabilities  
We assumed that 0% of patients treated with suzetrigine transition to OUD . Based on  available data  
that estimated the probability of developing OUD following an acute pain  episode , we assumed that 
0.43% of patients treated with HB/APAP will develop OUD by three years .53 We assume no further 
transition to OUD after three years.  The five -year proportion of patients who transitio ned to 
abstinence  (all of whom were assumed to be receiving MAT ) was 0.052. We allowed for transition 
to the abstinence state over the first eight years of the model (i.e ., patients who transition to OUD 
in the third year have up to five years to transition to abstinence).  We assumed no relapse from the 
abstinent state to OUD based on previous evidence of sustained abstinence  following five years of 
abstinence .51  
 
©Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 202 5 Page 25 
Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  Mortality  
For mortality in the OUD state, we identified the standardized all -cause mortality ratio for 
extramedical opioid use among North American cohorts.55 For the OUD abstinence state, we 
assumed that the mortality rate was equivalent to all -cause mortality for those in stabilized MAT 
and identified  the rate ratio of all -cause mortality among those in versus out of MAT among North 
American cohorts.56 Gender and age -specific mortality were sourced from CDC life  tables.63 
Health State Utilities  
Utilities for numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) levels at baseline and on treatment  were derived from 
a EuroQol -5 Dimension  (EQ-5D) mapping tool .64 On treatment utility did not differ between 
treatment arms and exceeded the average utility of the US adult population. Therefore, utility  
scores from one week to three months were based on average US population EQ -5D scores  (0.851) . 
Utilities for the OUD and abstinence states were based on a nationally representative survey that 
used the standard gamble approach to measure health -related quality of life of different opioid 
misuse and treatment states, including active injection drug m isuse, active prescription drug 
misuse, initiation and stabilization on both methadone and bupreno rphine treatment, and 
remission .57 We calculated weighted average utilities  for the OUD and abstinence states and then 
converted these utilities to disutilities.  
Cost Inputs  
Drug Costs  
To determine drug costs, we assumed that acute pain patients treated with either suzetrigine or 
HB/APAP would be supplied with a seven -day prescription (including any time as an inpatient and 
following discharge), regardless of whether all doses are ultimately needed.27,65 For suzetrigine, we 
used the wholesale acquisition cost  (WAC)  announced by the manufacturer of $15.50 per 50  mg 
pill. For HB/APAP, we identified the median spending per dosage unit in RedBook and assumed four 
doses per day for one week.66

Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  Non -Drug Costs  
Excess  health care costs for people with OUD were identified in a matched case -control study using 
administrative claims data across private and public payers and adjusted to represent the US 
population .60 This estimate includes the excess costs of inpatient, outpatient, and behavioral health 
care services such as MAT. For individuals in the abstinence state, we assumed  ongoing MAT. The 
costs of treatment with methadone and buprenorphine, inclusive of integrated psychosocial and 
medical support, were identified in a recent cost -effectiveness analysis of treatments for OUD .61 We 
assumed  equal utilization of methadone and buprenorphine when calculating a weighted average  
cost of MAT . Gender - and age -specific unrelated  health care costs and the cost of death were added  
to all health states .67

Base -Case Results  
The average per person total discounted costs, life years (LYs), quality -adjusted life years (QALYs), 
and equal value of life years (evLYs) gained  are detailed in Table 4.3. There were no differences in 
QALYs gained in the short -term decision tree  component of the model . Over the lifetime model , 
suzetrigine had a total discounted cost of $ 197,500 with discounted QALYs , LYs, and evLYs  of 18.65, 
21.92, and 18.65., respectively. Undi scounted OUD cases averted per 100,000  people w ere 429 in 
the suzetrigine arm. HB/APAP had a total discounted cost of $ 197,900 with discounted QALYs, LYs, 
and evLYs of 18.61, 21.89, and 18.61, respectively.

Table 4.4 presents the discounted lifetime incremental r esults, including cost per QALY gained, cost 
per evLY gained, cost per life year gained, and cost per OUD case averted. Total discounted costs for 
suzetrigine were approximately $400 less than HB/APAP ; gains in QALYs, LYs, and evLYs were 0. 039, 
0.032, and 0. 039, respectively, in relation to HB/APAP.  There were 429 per 100,000 fewer OUD 
cases when comparing suzetrigine to HB/APAP. This resulted in incremental cost -effectiveness 
ratios that were dominant (or less costly and more effective ) across all health outcomes.

Sensitivity Analyses  
To demonstrate the effects of uncertainty on both costs and health outcomes, we varied input 
parameters using available estimates of parameter uncertainty (e.g., standard errors or plausible 
parameter ranges). Because suzetrigine results in dominant (less costly, more effect ive) scenarios, 
we present a tornado diagram with incremental per person lifetime costs separate from 
incremental per person lifetime QALY and evLY estimates. Figures 4.2 and 4.3 present tornado 
diagrams resulting from the one -way sensitivity analyses for suzetrigine versus HB/APAP. Key 
drivers of cost -effectiveness estimates include the risk of OUD from a short course of HB/APAP, 
annual mean excess costs of OUD, and excess mortality related to OUD.  
Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were also performed by jointly varying multiple model parameters 
over at least 1,000 simulations . Tables 4.5 and 4.6 present the probability of reaching certain cost -
effectiveness thresholds for suzetrigine versus HB/APAP. A total of 94% and 96% of iterations for 
suzetrigine versus HB/APAP  were beneath a threshold of $1 00,000 per QALY or evLY  and $150,000 
per QALY or evLY,  respectively.

Model Validation  
We used several approaches to validate the model. First, we had three different decision modeling 
experts review the model structure, assumptions, and inputs. We revised data inputs b ased on 
feedback from multiple stakeholde rs, including the manufacturer , patient groups, and clinical 
experts. We also performed  model validation for the model calculations, including key pressure 
tests, using an internal reviewer. Additionally, a s part of ICER’s efforts in acknowledging modeling 
transparency, we shared  the model with the manufacturer for external validation. We received no 
direct comments on the validity of calculations in the model . Finally, we  validated outputs based on 
 
©Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 202 5 Page 30 
Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  observed evidence in the literature. One specific area of validation was in reference to the 
cumulative incidence of OUD  in the model against the cumulative incidence from the best available 
evidence.  
Uncertainty and Controversies  
The cost  effectiveness of suzetrigine for acute pain compared  to HB/APAP depends greatly on the 
incidence of OUD  from a short  course  of HB/ APAP. We used the best available evidence from a 
recent study  estimating the incidence of OUD following acute pain (defined as <3 months of 
continuous or recurrent use of pain medications within a year of opioid initiation) using commercial 
and Medicare claims among patients continuously insured.53 A limitation of this study is that opioid 
use after the initial opioid prescription but before developing OUD  was not recorded. Moreover , a 
general  limitation of claims data is that we canno t know the reasons for filling or not filling a 
prescription . As such, it is possible that some patients  classified as develop ing OUD following an 
acute pain episode might in fact  have developed OUD due to chronic pain.  
To address this limitation, we ran a scenario analysis to estimate the proportion of patients 
diagnosed with OUD that would result in  suzetrigine meeting the commonly cited cost -effectiv eness 
threshold of $100,000 per QALY and evLY . At the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC)  of $232.50  per 
week, suzetrigine meets  a threshold of $100,000 per evLY  with  a three -year cumulative risk of OUD 
approximately equal to 0.02% (or approximately 20 OUD cases per 100,000 people  receiving 
opioids) . This is a smaller risk than the base -case estimate of 0.43% , or 429 OUD cases per 100,000 
people . It is also possible that the incidence of OUD following acute pain could be higher than the 
base -case estimate of 0.43% . To address this uncertainty, we have used an upper bound of 5 .7% for 
the incidence of OUD in the one -way sensitivity analysis  using existing evidence among patients in  
commercia l, Medicare, and Medicaid plans .68 As expected, the health risks of OUD increase 
substantially  at a higher cumulative incidence of OUD , resulting in larger cost savings and greater 
health benefits for suzetrigine versus HB/APAP.  Given that the transition to OUD from acute pain  is 
highly influential on model outputs, future evidence should seek to isolate both the effect of acute 
pain (versus chronic pain) and the effect of initial treatment with opioids (versus non -opioids) on 
the risk of developing OUD . 
We acknowledge that different inputs may yield alternative results. For example, the societal 
perspective  estimates may underestimate the economic burden of OUD, especially given the 
heterogeneity of the impact of the opioid epidemic.  Our base -case analysis included estimates of 
the excess costs of both OUD and continued lifetime treatment for OUD using MAT  with a modified 
societal perspective that includes criminal justice system costs, lost productivity costs, and quality 
of life decrements for caregiver s of persons with OUD. Other example s may include a different 
distribution of MAT utilization  in different areas of the country , lost lifetime earnings due to 
mortality, child and family assistance, education  outcomes,  or different efficacy estimates among 
 
©Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 202 5 Page 31 
Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  subgroups . In general, literature -based estimates are subject to different data sources as well as 
heterogeneity among persons with OUD. To address any variation in input sources, we expanded 
our parameter uncertainty analyses to ensure we include both higher and lower estimates of 
inputs.  In our sensitivity and scenario analyses, the conclusions were consistent with the base -case 
analysis.  
4.4 Summary and Comment  
This analysis  found that the use of suzetrigine for treating moderate -to-severe acute pain is slightly 
cost-saving (approximately $400 over a lifetime horizon) compared to HB/APAP , using the 
wholesale acquisition cost of $232.50  for a one-week  prescription to treat acute pain . The cost 
savings are primarily due to averting cases of OUD, which has significant negative impacts on 
mortality and quality of life and is associated with excess  health care costs . As such, the economic 
impact of suzetrigine in this model is sensitive to the incidence of OUD that would be observed after 
a short -course of opioids for acute pain. The societal perspective extends cost saving estimates to 
include  lost productivity , criminal justice costs , and quality of life decrements for caregivers of 
pers ons with OUD.

Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  5. Benefits Beyond Health and Special Ethical 
Priorities  
Our reviews seek to provide information on benefits beyond health and special ethical priorities  
offered by the intervention to the individual patient, caregivers, the delivery system, other patients, 
or the public that was not available in the evidence base nor could be adequately estimated within 
the cost -effectiveness model . These elements are listed in the table below, with related information 
gathered from patients and other stakeholders . Following the public deliberation on this report the 
appraisal c ommittee will vote on the degree to which each of these factors should affect overall 
judgments of long -term value for money of the intervention(s) in this review.  
Table 5.1. Benefits Beyond Health and Special Ethical Priorities  
Benefits Beyond Health and Special Ethical Priorities  Relevant Information  
There is substantial unmet need despite currently 
available treatments.  Currently, m any patients with acute pain are treated with 
opioid analgesics for management .3 However,  opioid 
prescriptions for acute pain carry  the risk of developing 
persistent opioid use and/or opioid use disorder (OUD) , 
which is associated with  poorer  quality of life and higher 
mortality . 4  
 
To inform unmet need as a benefit beyond health, the 
results for the absolute and proportional shortfalls have 
been reported below. The shortfalls were the same, 
regardles s of whether QALY or evLY was used.  
 
QALY and evLY shortfalls:  
• Absolute shortfall: 0.24  
• Proportional shortfall: 0.8%  
 
The absolute and proportional shortfalls represent the 
total and proportional health units of remaining quality 
adjusted life expectancy, respectively, that would be lost 
due to un - or under -treated illness. Please refer to the ICER 
Reference Case  – Section 2. Quantifying Unmet Need 
(QALY and evLY Shortfalls) for the shortfalls of other 
conditions assessed in prior ICER reviews.

This condition is of substantial relevance for people 
from a racial/ethnic group that have not been 
equitably served by the health  care system.  
 
 
 
 
  Acute pain is ubiquitous; however we heard from some 
stakeholders that populations underserved by the health  
care system are more likely to receive opioids for pain 
management because they are inexpensive, and heard 
from other stakeholders that such populations are broadly 
undertreated for pain as discussed in Section 2.  
The treatment is likely to produce substantial 
improvement in caregivers’ quality of life and/or 
ability to pursue their own education, work, and 
family life.  Acute pain is unlikely to create a substantial burden for 
caregivers relative to life goals, as it is time limited. If 
suzetrigine leads to important reductions in the 
development of OUD, this could importantly affect some 
caregivers. Similarly, if better treatment of p ain with 
suzetrigine leads to less long -term psychological sequelae, 
such as anxiety or depression, this could also improve 
caregiver outcomes. The effects of treating acute pain with 
suzetrigine on the development of chronic pain are 
currently unknown.  
The treatment offers a substantial opportunity to 
improve access to effective treatment by means of 
its mechanism of action or method of delivery.  Suzetrigine has a new mechanism of action and so may 
improve access to effective treatment for patients who 
cannot receive other oral pain medications.  
 
 
ICER did not calculate the Health Improvement Distribution Index (HIDI) because  there is no reason 
to expect the prevalence of acute pain to vary  substantially by race/ethnicity.

Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  6. Health Benefit Price Benchmark   
The Health Benefit Price Benchmark (HBPB) for the weekly cost of treatment with suzetrigine is 
presented in Table 6.1 below. The HBPB for a drug is defined as the price range that would achieve 
incremental cost -effectiveness ratios between $100,000 per QALY and $150,000 per evLY gained. 
We estimate that at its announced price of $2 32.50  per week, suzetrigine would be slightly cost-
saving .

Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  7. Potential Budget Impact   
7.1. Overview of Key Assumptions  
Results from the cost -effectiveness model were used to estimate the total potential budgetary 
impact of suzetrig ine compared to HB/APAP for patients with acute pain not adequately controlled 
with non -systemic therapies. Potential budget impact is defined as the total differential cost of 
using the new therapy rather than relevant existing therapy for the treated popu lation, calculated 
as differential health care costs (including drug costs) minus any offsets in these costs from averted 
health care events. A ll costs were undiscounted and estimated over a five -year time horizon. We 
used the WAC  price  of $2 32.50  for one week of prescription and the three threshold prices (at 
$50,000, $100,000, and $150,000 per evLYG) for suzetrig ine in our estimate of budget impact.  
This potential budget impact analysis included the estimated number of individuals in the US who 
would be eligible for suzetrig ine. To estimate the size of the potential candidate population, we 
used inputs for the US prevalence of acute pain requiring management with prescription 
medication. A retrospective cross -sectional study using two nationally representative datasets from 
2019 estimated that 80.2 million patients in the US annually experience acute pain, defined as 
requiring prescription pain medicat ion for less than three  months.2 Among all patients with acute 
pain, 10.9 million patients with both acute and chronic pain were excluded to ensure alignment 
with the specific population studied in the cost -effectiveness analysis. The prevalence of acute pain 
(69.3 million) was multiplied  by the proportion of acute pain patients who received one or more 
prescriptions or administrations of opioids (51%) to estimate the number of patients likely to 
receive opioids for treating acute pain each year.2 Other types of treatment, such as nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and non -opioid analgesics, were not considered in estimating the 
number of eligible patients, as suzetrigine is anticipated to primarily displace opioids, which are the 
main c omparator in the cost -effectiveness analysis. Applying these findings results in estimates of 
35.3 million eligible patients in the US per year. For the purposes of this analysis, we will assume 
that 20% of these patients would initiate treatment in each o f the five years, or 7.1 million patients 
per year.

Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  7.2. Results  
Figure 7.1 illustrates the cumulative per patient treated potential budget impact for suzetrig ine 
compared to HB/A PAP. The cumulative per patient budget impact represents the incremental costs 
of suzetrigine compared to HB/ APAP per patient across all patients treated within a time horizon 
(including those who initiated suzetrigine in previous years), assuming suzetrigine is used with 20% 
uptake each year  over five years .  
At suzetrig ine’s WAC  price  of $232.50  for one week of prescription, the average annual budget 
impact per patient was $ 222 in year one, with cumulative budget impact  decreas ing to $126 over  a 
five-year time horizon . This is because suzetrigine is taken only in the first year, with cost savings 
occurring in subsequent years after treatment.  
Figure 7. 1. Cumulative Per Patient Budget Impact for Suzetrig ine Compared to HB/A PAP using a 
WAC  Price for Suzetrig ine  
 
 
Assuming a 20% uptake of suzetrig ine each year, 82.3 % of patients could be treated over five years 
at the WAC  price before reaching the ICER potential budget impact threshold of $735 million per 
year. Fewer percentages of eligible patients could be treated at the $50,000, $100,000 and 
$150,000 per evLY threshold prices ( 4.2%, 2.3% and 1.6%, respectively) as illustrated in Figure 7.2.

Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  A. Background: Supplemental Information   
A1. Definitions  
Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS): A scale for self -report of pain, with the respondent selecting a 
number that best reflects the intensity of their pain using a 0 –10 scale, with zero meaning “no pain” 
and 10 meaning “the worst pain imaginable”.69 
Sum of the Pain Intensity Difference (SPID): A measure derived from the NPRS that summarizes 
treatment response over a clinically relevant period (e.g., SPID -48 hours). H igher SPID values 
represent greater reduction in pain.10 
Verbal Categorical Rating Scale (VRS): A four -level scale that ranges from no pain to severe pain.70 
Patient Global Assessment (PGA): A measurement of pain treatment effectiveness, where patients 
rate their experience as poor, fair, good, very good, or excellent.71 
Other Relevant Definitions  
Absolute and Proportional Shortfalls: Absolute and proportional shortfalls are empirical 
measurements that capture different aspects of society’s instincts for prioritization related to the 
severity or burden of an illness. The absolute shortfall is defined as the total absolute amount of 
future health patients with a condition are expected to lose without the treatment that is being 
assessed.72 The ethical consequences of using absolute shortfall to prioritize treatments is that 
conditions that cause early death or that have very serious lifelong effects on quality of life receive 
the greatest prioritization. Thus, certain kinds of treatments, s uch as treatments for rapidly fatal 
conditions of children, or for lifelong disabling conditions, score highest on the scale of absolute 
shortfall. The proportional shortfall is measured by calculating the proportion of the total health 
units of remaining life expectancy that would be lost due to untreated illness.73,74 The proportional 
shortfall reflects the ethical instinct to prioritize treatments for patients whose illness would rob 
them of a large percentage of their expected remaining lifetime. As with absolute shortfall, rapidly 
fatal conditions of childhood have high proportional shortfalls, but high numbers can also often 
arise from severe conditions among older adults who may have only a few years left of average life 
expectancy but would lose much of that to the illness without treatment. Details on how to 
calculate the absolute and proportional QALY and evLY shortfalls can be found in ICER’s reference 
case . Shortfalls will be highlighted when asking the independent appraisal committees to vote on 
unmet need despite current treatment options as part of characterizing a treatment’s benefits 
beyond health and special ethical priorities  (Section 5 ).

Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  Health Improvement Distribution Index (HIDI) : The HIDI identifies a subpopulation that has a 
higher prevalence of the disease of interest and therefore  creates an opportunity for 
proportionately more health gains within the subpopulation. This opportunity may be realized by 
achieving equal access both within and outside the identified subpopulation to an intervention that 
is known to improve health. The HIDI is defined as the disease prevalence in the subpopulation 
divided by the disease prevalence in the o verall population. For example, if a disease has a 
prevalence of 10% among Black Americans whereas the disease prevalence among all Americans is 
4%, then the Health Improvement Distribution Index is 10%/4%=2.5. In this example, a HIDI of 2.5 
means that Bla ck Americans as a subpopulation would benefit more on a relative basis (2.5 times 
more) from a new effective intervention compared with the overall population. HIDIs above one 
suggest that more health may be gained on the relative scale in the subpopulatio n of interest when 
compared to the population as a whole. The HIDI may be helpful in characterizing a treatment’s 
benefits beyond health and special ethical priorities  (Section 5 ).  
We chose not to calculate the HIDI due to a lack of sufficient data of acute pain rates in racial and 
ethnic minority populations. There is a trend for people from racial and ethnic minority populations 
to underreport pain intensity, contributing to dispar ities in pain management.75 Thus, we are 
unable to confidently provide a racial  and ethnic breakdown of the US population who experience 
acute pain as cases in these subgroups are likely to go unreported.  
A2. Potential Cost -Saving Measures in Acute Pain  
ICER includes in its reports information on wasteful or lower -value services in the same clinical area 
that could be reduced or eliminated to create headroom in health care budgets for higher -value 
innovative services (for more information, see https://icer.org/our -approach/methods -
process/value -assessment -framework/ ). These services are ones that would not be directly affected 
by therapies for acute pain (e.g., need for treatment of opioid overdose), as these services will be 
captured in the economic model. Rather, we are seeking services used in the current manageme nt 
of acute pain beyond the potential offsets that arise from a new intervention. During stakeholder 
engagement and public comment periods, ICER encouraged all stakeholders to suggest services 
(including treatments and mechanisms of care) currently used fo r patients with acute pain that 
could be reduced, eliminated, or made more efficient. No suggestions were received.  
We received a suggestion from a clinician  that there should be a reduction in  the use of opioids, 
benzodiazepines , gabapentinoids, and mu scle relaxants  in patients who present with acute back 
pain in an acute care setting.

Manufacturers were asked to submit a written explanation of how they engaged patients in the 
design of their clinical trials, including the methods used to gather patient experience data and how 
they determined the outcomes that matter most to patients. IC ER did not receive any feedback on 
this specific inquiry.

Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  B. Patient Perspectives :  Supplemental 
Information   
B1. Methods  
As part of our review, we spoke to two individual patients and three patient groups (Patient Mind, 
US Pain Foundation, and Voices for Non -Opioid choices)  and with a bioethicist who has experienced 
and written about acute pain.  
The individual patients both experienced acute pain in the setting of chronic pain; we had difficulty 
finding individual patients to speak with who were only experiencing acute pain. These two patients 
were unaware of suzetrigine.  
Apart from informing Section 2  of this report, the input we received contributed to our deciding not 
to focus on chronic use of non -opioid medications as a comparative outcome in this review and to 
perform network meta -analyses comparing suzetrigine with NSAIDs and higher dose opioids.

Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  C. Clinical Guidelines   
American Pain Society, American Society of Regional Anesthesia, and American 
Society of Anesthesiologists  
This 2016 guideline for postoperative pain management makes recommendations that are broad 
and focused on good practice.76 Recommendations include tailored education around treatment 
options; documentation of plans and goals; teaching caregivers how to assess pain in children; 
assessing patients for a history of psychiatric comorbidities, chronic pain, substance abuse, and 
prior postoperative treatment regimens and responses; and adjustment of the pain management 
plan based on adequacy of pain relief and the occurrence of adverse events.  
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  
This 2022 guideline for prescribing opioids for pain shares a senior/first author with the above 2016 
guideline but is much more directive in its recommendations.27 It relies on a number of evidence 
reviews by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) including a 2020 AHRQ review 
of treatments for acute pain.77 
Recommendations for acute pain include maximizing the use of nonpharmacologic and nonopioid 
therapies; discuss risks and benefits before prescribing opioids; prescribe immediate -release 
opioids rather than more extended -release forms; prescribe the lowest effective dose and be 
cautious about increasing the dose; and limit the quantity of prescribed opioids to the expected 
duration of need.  
The first recommendation in the guideline states, “Nonopioid therapies are at least as effective as 
opioids for many common types of acute pain.” Although this is consistent with the AHRQ review 
mentioned above that found this to be the case even for nonop ioid pharmacologic therapies, we 
note that we heard from a number of clinical experts who disagree with this with regard to 
pharmacologic therapies.

Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  Society of Hospital Medicine  
This 2018 consensus guideline makes recommendations for the use of opioids for treating 
noncancer pain in hospitalized adults.78 Recommendations include limiting the use of opioids to 
patients with severe pain, moderate pain that has not responded to nonopioid therapy, or when 
nonopioid therapy is contraindicated; use caution when administering opioids to patients at 
increased risk  for adverse events; educate patients and caregivers about risks and side effects of 
opioids; use the lowest effective opioid dose for the shortest possible duration; use immediate 
release formulations of opioids; and use the oral route of administration o f opioids whenever 
possible.

Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  Data Sources and Searches  
Procedures for the systematic literature review assessing the evidence on suzetrigine for acute 
pain, as well as opioids and NSAIDs for post -operative abdominoplasty or bunionectomy acute pain, 
followed established best research methods.80,81 We conducted the review in accordance with the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta -Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.82 The 
PRISMA guidelines include a checklist of 27 items (see Table D1.1).  
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central 
Register of Controlled Trials for relevant studies. Each search was limited to English -language 
studies of human subjects and excluded articles indexed as guidelines, letters, editorials, narrative 
reviews, case reports, or news items. We included abstracts from conference proceedings identified 
from the systematic literature search. All search strategies were generated utilizing the Population, 
Intervention, Comparator, and Study Design elements described above. The proposed search 
strategies inclu ded a combination of indexing terms (MeSH terms in MEDLINE and EMTREE terms in 
EMBASE), as well as free -text terms.  
To supplement the database searches, we performed  manual checks of the reference lists of 
included trials and systematic reviews and invited key stakeholders to share references germane to 
the scope of this project. We also supplemented our review of published studies with data from 
conference proceedings , regulatory documents, information submitted by manufacturers, and 
other grey literature when the evidence met ICER standards (for more information, see the Policy 
on Inclusion of Grey Literature in Evidence Reviews .

Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  Study Selection  
We performed screening at both the abstract and full -text level. Two investigators independently 
screened all titles and abstracts identified through electronic searches according to the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria described earlier using Nested Knowl edge (Nested Knowledge, Inc, St. Paul, 
Minnesota );a third reviewer worked with the initial two reviewers to resolve any issues of 
disagreement through consensus. We did not exclude any study at abstract -level screening due to 
insufficient information. For example, an abstract that did not report an outcome of interest would 
be accepted for further review in full text. We retrieved the citations that were accepted during 
abstract -level screening for full text appraisal. One investigator reviewed full papers and provided 
justification for exclusion of each excluded study.  
Data Extraction  
Data were extracted into Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel. The basic design and elements of the 
extraction forms followed those used for other ICER reports. Elements included a description of 
patient populations, sample size, duration of follow -up, funding source, study design f eatures, 
interventions (agent, dosage, frequency, schedules), concomitant therapy allowed and used (agent, 
dosage, frequency, schedules), outcome assessments, results, and risk of bias for each study. The 
data extraction was performed in the following step s: 
1. One reviewer extracted information from the full articles, and a second reviewer validated 
the extracted data.  
2. Extracted data were reviewed for logic, and a random proportion of data were validated by 
a third investigator for additional quality assurance.  
Risk of Bias Assessment   
We examined the risk of bias for each  randomized trial  in this review  using criteria published in the 
Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool Version 2.81,83 Risk of bias was assessed by study outcome 
for each of the following aspects of the trials: randomization process, deviation from the intended 
interventions, missing outcome data, measurement of the outcome, selection of the reported 
results, and overall r isk of bias. Two reviewers independently assessed these domains. Any 
disagreements were resolved through discussion or by consulting a third reviewer. Clinical trials 
that did not have a corresponding peer -reviewed journal article were assessed on their publicly 
available sources of information, such as ClinicalTrials.gov record and statistical analysis plan.84 
 
 
 
©Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 202 5 Page D11 
Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  To assess the risk of bias in trials, we rated the categories as: “low risk of bias,” “some concerns,” or 
“high risk of bias.”  Guidance for risk of bias ratings using these criteria is presented below:  
Low risk of bias : The study is judged to be at low risk of bias for all domains for this result.  
Some concerns : The study is judged to raise some concerns in at least one domain for this result, but 
not to be at high risk of bias for any domain.  
High risk of bias : The study is judged to be at high risk of bias in at least one domain for this result 
or the study is judged to have some concerns for multiple domains in a way that substantially lowers 
confidence in the result.  
We examined the risk of bias for the outcome of SPID48. See Table D1. 6.

Notes: After rescue medication (hydrocodone/APAP [5 mg/500 mg]), pain assessments for the subsequent six hours  were considered 
missing, with the pain assessment at rescue medication time carried forward (LOCF). A significantly greater proportion of par ticipants 
in the placebo arm utilized rescue medication than those in the diclofenac arm (91% vs 43%). The substan tial difference in 
missing/imputed data between study groups indicates a high risk of bias in outcome data. For patients who  discontinued the study, the

Notes: SPID48 was a secondary outcome in this study. After rescue medication (hydrocodone/APAP [5 mg/500 mg]), pain assessments 
for the subsequent six hours  were considered missing, with the pain assessment at rescue medication time carried forward (LOCF). A 
significantly greater proportion of participants in the placebo arm utilized rescue medication than those in the diclofenac a rm (92% vs 
58%). The substan tial difference in missing/imputed data between study groups indicates a high risk of bias in outcome data.  For 
patients who discontinued the study, the WOCF approach was used for the remainder of the 48 -hour multiple -dose period. However, 
few patients in each arm discontinued the trial: 3% diclofenac and 6% placebo.

Notes: The imputation method used BOCF (Baseline Observation Carried Forward) when subjects used rescue medication, withdrew 
due to lack of efficacy, or experienced adverse events. LOCF was used for withdrawals due to other reasons. High rescue medication 
rates (82 -85% in treatment arms, 97% in placebo) resulted in substantial missing data. FDA sensitivity analyses using no imputation and  
6-hour windowed LOCF confirmed the primary analysis showing tre atment groups superior to placebo, though standardized mean

Notes: Missing pain intensity scores due to discontinuation from related AEs or lack of efficacy were imputed using the WOCF. Scores  
missing due to other reasons for discontinuation used the LOCF. When rescue medication was taken within the 48 hours, the 
prerescu e pain intensity score was used to impute all scores within four  hours post -medication, even if another dose of study 
medication was administered within this period. There were similar rates of rescue mediation (acetaminophen or oxycodone HCl)  use 
between the celecoxib and placebo study arms (88.4 and 88.8%, respectively). Sensitivity analyses around different styles of 
imputation (e.g., no imputation, WOCF for all missing data) were largely supportive of the main analysis, with the exception of 
adjusted an alysis for rescue medication use, which did not find a statistically significant difference between treatment and placebo.

Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  Evaluation of Clinical Trial Diversity  
We evaluated the demographic diversity of clinical trials using the ICER -developed Clinical trial 
Diversity Rating (CDR) Tool .20 The CDR tool was designed to evaluate the three demographic 
characteristics described in Table D1.5. Representation for each demographic category was 
evaluated by quantitatively comparing clinical trial participants with disease -specific prevalence 
estimates, using the metric “Participant to Disease -prevalence Representation Ratio” (PDRR). Next, 
a representation score between zero  to three  was assigned based on the PDRR estimate (See Table 
D1.6 for the PDRR cut points that correspond to each representation score). Finally, based on the 
total score of the demographic characteristics (e.g., race and ethnicit y), the categories “Good,” 
“Fair,” or “Poor” are used to communicate the overall level of diversity of a clinical trial. The 
description of the rating categories for each demographic characteristic is provided in Table D1.7.   
Prevalence estimates of moderate to severe acute pain stratified by race/ethnicity, sex, and age 
were not available. Instead, we compared the demographic characteristics of the participants in the 
two pivotal suzetrigine trials, NAVIGATE -1 and NAVIGATE -2, to three reference populations: the 
overall United States population, and patients who have undergone the same surgical procedures 
as in the trials, specifically abdominoplasty and bunionectomy.

Assessment of Level of Certainty in Evidence  
We used the ICER Evidence Rating Matrix  to evaluate the level of certainty in the available evidence 
of a net health benefit among each of the interventions of focus (see Appendix D).106,107 
Assessment of Bias  
As part of our quality assessment, we evaluated the evidence base for the presence of potential 
publication bias. Given the emerging nature of the evidence base for newer treatments, as well as 
the large number of investigated therapies for acute pain, par ticularly in our two acute pain models 
of abdominoplasty and bunionectomy, we performed an assessment of publication bias for 
suzetrigine and other therapies in our network meta -analysis using ClinicalTrials.gov. Search terms 
included “VX -548", "suzetrigin e”, “abdominoplasty”, and “bunionectomy”.  
We identified two studies that were conducted and posted study results to ClinicalTrials.gov, but 
did not produce a peer -reviewed publication: NCT01038609 and NCT02487108, two bunionectomy 
trials that evaluated several combinations of hydrocodone /acetaminophen versus placebo.  
 
D2. Network Meta -Analysis Methodology and Results  
Feasibility of Conducting Indirect Comparison / Network Meta -Analysis (NMA)  
We examined the feasibility of conducting indirect comparisons or  an NMA because direct evidence 
for the comparative efficacy of suzetrigine  versus high -dose opioids and suzetrigine versus  NSAIDs 
for acute pain  was not available. We examined whether there were notable differences in study 
populations, study design, intervention type, outcome definition and measurement, and analytic 
methods, as well as quality of these studies.  
 
 
©Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 202 5 Page D21 
Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  Sixteen trials met the criteria for inclusion in the NMA, demonstrating sufficient similarity across 
critical study parameters, including population characteristics, experimental design, intervention 
approaches, outcome definitions, and analytical methodol ogies (detailed in Table D2.3  and D3.1 ). 
Most of the trials focused on post -surgical pain following bunionectomy procedures. The study 
populations were predominantly female, with participants typically in their early to mid -40s, and 
characterized by a base line pain intensity averaging around six on a ten-point scale.  
Figure D2.1 . Network Diagram  (16 Trials)  
 
Treatments with direct comparisons are linked with a line. The thickness of the line corresponds to the number of 
trials in the comparison .  
NMA Methods  
The pivotal trials of suzetrigine provided a direct comparison versus no systemati c therapy 
(represented by placebo arms) and HB5/APAP325 every six hours , which we deemed to be a low -
dose opioid analgesic in typical clinical practice given the strength of hydrocodone and frequency of 
treatment. As there  were no direct evidence for the comparative efficacy of suzetrigine against two 
additional classes of analgesics: high -dose oral opioids  (therapies with greater dose and frequency 
of opioid use than HB5/APAP325)  and NSAIDs, both with and without acetaminophen , we 
conducted a network meta -analysis .  
We restricted our systematic literature search to the study population of patients with acute pain 
following abdominoplasty and bunionectomy procedures to align with the studied population of the 
suzetrigine clinical trials. These  procedures represent validated pain models for soft-tissue and 
hard -tissue pain , respectively, and are recognized  by regulatory authorities  as benchmark models  
for analgesic drug approval.108

Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  Our outcome of interest was the SPID48, a time -weighted sum of the pain -intensity difference over 
the 48 -hour period . This is a common primary endpoint in acute pain trials and was evaluated as a 
continuous outcome. Table D2. 4 provides an overview of each study arm’s SPID48 mean scores and 
respective standard error and standard deviation. Because there are differences in how the SPID48 
was measured (using the Numerical Pain Rating Scale or Visual Analog Scale ) and reported (positive 
or negative least square s mean) across the trials in our network, we calculated the standardized 
mean difference between the active treatment and placebo arms for each study (Table D2.4). We 
explored the feasibility of assessing suzetrigine and other analgesics on safety and tolerability 
outcomes but found inconsistent durations of follow -up across our trials and did not proceed with 
the analysis.  
A full list of included therapies and their dosages are outlined in Table D2.1. We categorized the 
interventions into classes, which included low -dose and high -dose opioids, NSAIDs, suzetrigine, and 
placebo  (Figure D2.1) . We excluded intravenous formulations of NSAID and opioid analgesics for 
two reasons: first, their rapid onset of action would likely distort SPID48 values (as earlier pain 
reduction would yield higher scores compared to equivalent oral doses); and second, we aimed to 
compare therapies typi cally used in outpatient care.  We excluded  tapentadol and tramadol from 
our analysis based on specific clinical factors. Tapentadol was excluded due to its limited use in 
clinical practice  and absence of a generic equivalent. Tramadol was omitted because it is believed to 
present comparable side effects and addiction risks  to other opioids  while provi ding  less effective 
pain management, rendering it less meaningful as a clinical compara tor. 
The NMA  used  a Bayesian random -effects approach using normal likelihood with identity link.  
Noninformative prior distributions were applied to all model parameters, and each analysis was 
conducted using 100,000 iterations , after discarding the first 5,000 burn -in iterations . The input was 
standardized mean difference s between active treatment and placebo  in SPID48 (using the 
Numerical Pain Rating Scale or Visual Analog Scale ) and standard error. For one study 
(NCT01743625 ), we imputed the unknown standard e rror value for both study arms by calculating 
the mean standard error scores from comparable trials within the network.109 We evaluated model 
fit for all outcomes and ran both random  and fixed -effects models for comparison ( Table D2.2). Due 
to the heterogeneity among  the included trials in our network  (Table D2.3) , we focused on the 
results of the random -effects NMA results described in the main report.

Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  Our base -case analysis  consisted of 12 trials, 10 of which were bunionectomy trials. We conducted 
a sensitivity analysis that included  only on bunionectomy trials and found the results to be 
consistent with the base  case (Table D2.6). We identified several studies in our network that had 
significantly greater SMD/effect size values (e.g ., SMD of 1.4 of diclofenac 25  mg versus placebo) 
that we believe may be due to different rates of use of rescue medication between study arms and 
subsequent imputation of SP ID48 scores. We considered these studies to be at high risk of bias due 
to their treatment of missing data (see Table D1.6) and excluded them from the base -case analysis. 
A sensitivity analysis that included all relevant trials, irrespective of their risk of bias, demonstrated 
no change in the statistical significance of any point estimates. However, the point estimates for 
higher -dose opioids and NSAIDs  versus placebo  were higher  than those reported  in the base -case 
analysis (Table D2.7).  Lastly, a sensiti vity analys is in which the missing standard error values for the  
two study arms in  trial NCT01743625  were changed to the highest standard error value in the 
sample . We chose this as the most conservative approac h to handling missing data.  109 This analysis  
produced similar point estimates to the base case  (Table D2.8) .

Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  NMA Limitations  
There are limitations to our NMA.  There is  uncertainty surrounding the liberal use of rescue 
medication in acute pain trials; most study arms saw greater than 80% of patients requesting 
additional analgesic relief (e.g., ibuprofen or HB/APAP) over the 48 hour -follow -up period. This high 
use of rescue medication can  distort  the measured treatment difference between an active 
treatment and placebo . Additionally, there was variability in how missing data was imputed (e.g., 
last observation) and it is likely to have  had an impact on the calculation of p ain intensity via SPID48 
and comparative effectiveness. Clinical trials are increasingly us ing windowed imputation 
approache s to account for the analgesic relief provided within a four -to-six-hour period  after rescue 
medication . However, an analysis of several bunionectomy trials found that even use of windowed 
imputation can produce findings  that appear counterintuitive, such as resulting in higher SPID48 
values in the placebo arm.110  
Suzetrigine was evaluated as a monotherapy against therapies which are combination drugs (e.g., 
hydrocodone/ acetaminophen), which are more in line with real -world practice. An ad hoc analysis 
was performed in the Phase III suzetrigine trials that assessed the effect of ibuprofen rescue 
medication added on to suzetrigine and placebo arms without imputing NPRS scores; the calculated 
effect  sizes between the therapies were slightly lower in this real -world multimodal treatment 
comparison.  
Due to the different scales used  to assess pain intensity , we opted to use standardized  mean 
differences as our model output. While these may not offer immediately clear interpretation, raw 
SPID48 scores similarly lack straightforward clinical meaning, as the field has not established a 
consensus regarding a clinically significant change threshold for acute pain outcomes .111 
The pooling of medications within the NSAID and high -dose opioids may o bscure unique treatment 
effects specific to individual medications . In a related issue, t he NSAIDs used in the network are 
newer reformulations of drugs that have been in common use for decades, which may impact the 
generalizability of study results. These reformulations are typically created to increase faster onset 
of analgesic activity and reduce side effects. However, the extent to which these interventions 
represent the current analgesic market is unclear.  
The NMA provided insight on analgesics' ability to reduce pain intensity, but this represents only 
one dimension of the decision -making process. Other critical factors, such as safety and tolerability, 
particularly regarding opioid -related adverse events a nd addiction potential, were not available for 
analysis. Our review qualitatively  addressed known harms of short -term opioid and NSAID use in 
the Harms section of the report.

Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  D5. Previous Systematic Reviews and Technology Assessments  
Our review found no ongoing health technology assessments for suzetrigine. While analgesics for 
acute pain are typically evaluated within specific surgical contexts, we identified no procedure -
specific recommendations for post -operative pain management in either abdominoplasty or 
bunionectomy procedures.112 Although several systematic reviews examine analgesics for 
postoperative pain, these analyses face important limitations. The studies often aggregate data 
from diverse surgical procedures that differ substantially in their pain characteristics (e.g., type  
[somatic v ersus  visceral], location, intensity, and duration) and in how inadequate pain relief affects 
postoperative organ function. Moreover, analgesic efficacy can vary significantly depending on the 
specific surgical procedure, making broad generalizations challengin g. 
Cochrane Review: Single Dose Analgesics for Acute Postoperative Pain in Adults  
The study reviewed 39 Cochrane Reviews analyzing single -dose oral analgesics for acute 
postoperative pain, encompassing around 50,000 participants across approximately 460 studies.113 
It focused on high -quality trials with standardized methods and outcomes, without performing 
statistical comparisons.  
The Number Needed to Treat (NNT) for achieving at least 50% maximum pain relief over four to six 
hours compared with placebo ranged from 1.5 to 20. For example:  
Ibuprofen 200 mg + Paracetamol 500 mg: NNT of 1.6  
Ibuprofen Fast Acting 200 mg: NNT of 2.1  
Diclofenac Potassium 50 mg: NNT of 2.1  
Etoricoxib 120 mg: NNT of 1.8

Description of evLY Calculations  
The equal value life year (evLY) considers any extension of life at the same “weight” no matter what 
treatment is being evaluated or what population is being modeled. Below are the stepwise 
calculations used to calculate the evLY.  
1. First, we attribute a utility of 0.851, the age - and sex -adjusted utility of the general 
population in the US that are considered healthy.115  
2. We calculate the evLY for each model cycle.  
3. Within a model cycle, if using the intervention results in additional life years versus the 
primary comparator, we multiply the general population utility of 0.851 with the additional 
life years gained (ΔLY gained) within the cycle.  
4. The life years shared between the intervention and the comparator use the conventional 
utility estimate for those life years within the cycle.  
5. The total evLY for a cycle is calculated by summing steps three  and four . 
6. The evLY for the comparator arm is equivalent to the QALY for each model cycle.  
7. The total evLYs are then calculated as the sum of evLYs across all model cycles over the time 
horizon.  
Finally, the evLYs gained is the incremental difference in evLYs between the intervention and the 
comparator arm.  
Target Population  
The population of focus for the economic evaluation included adult patients with moderate -to-
severe acute pain not adequately controlled with non -systemic therapies. We defined the 
characteristics of this population using evidence from an evaluation of the incidence of OUD among 
people with acute pain.  Although these population characteristics differed from those in the Phase 
III suzetrigine trials, they better reflect those who are at risk of moderate -to-severe acute pain.

Treatment Strategies  
The model compared suzetrigine to HB/APAP. HB/APAP is commonly prescribed for short -term pain 
management after surgery or injury but carries a risk of dependency due to the opioid component.  
Model Structure  
The model structure is depicted in Figure 4.1. Health outcomes and costs depended on time spent 
in each health state and related and unrelated direct and indirect health care costs. Health 
outcomes included life years gained, quality -adjusted life years (Q ALYs) gained, and equal value of 
life years (evLY) gained. Mortality was a function of all -cause mortality using US life tables for 
patients without OUD and OUD -specific mortality for patients with OUD. Quality of life weights 
were applied to each health s tate and derived from publicly available sources. The up -front decision 
tree captured differences in quality of life from acute pain interventions using an EQ -5D mapping 
instrument to the numeric pain rating scale (NPRS).64 Productivity changes and other indirect costs 
(e.g., non -health related costs such as criminal justice system costs) were included in a separate 
modified societal perspective analysis. All costs were inflated to 2024 US dollars using the medical 
care comp onent of the consumer price index (CPI) for health care costs and all items of the CPI for 
other costs. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% per year.  Results were expressed in terms 
of incremental cost per QALY gained, cost per evLYG, cost per life year gained, and cost per OUD 
case averted.

Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  Clinical Inputs  
Clinical Probabilities/Response to Treatment  
Baseline NPRS scores and reductions in pain following treatment were reported for two trials 
(abdominoplasty and bunionectomy).62 Using both trials, we calculated a weighted average baseline 
NPRS score and an on -treatment NPRS score for both treatment arms (measured at 48 hours). The 
time in each NPRS state was used to estimate utility scores and improvements in pain in both arms 
of the model.  
Transition Probabilities  
In addition to the probability of transitioning to OUD, we calculated the probability of transitioning 
from OUD to sustained abstinence. Among those with OUD, 25.1% receive MAT and sustained five -
year abstinence from all opioids is achieved by 20.7% of tho se receiving MAT.50,54 Combining these 
two estimates resulted in a five -year proportion of patients with OUD achieving abstinence of 
0.052. We calibrated the model for both the three -year incidence of OUD (i.e., 0.43%) and for the 
0.052 who transitioned to the abstinence state by five years following transition to OUD.  
Utilities  
We derived a baseline utility of 0.57 using a tool for mapping NPRS levels to EQ -5D values.64 On-
treatment utility did not differ between treatment groups (0.88). We truncated post -treatment 
utility at the average utility of the US adult population (0.851) and applied this utility from one week 
to three months.  Utilities for the OUD and abstinence states were based on a nationally 
representative survey that used the standard gamble approach to measure health -related quality of 
life of different opioid misuse and treatment states, including active injection drug m isuse, active 
prescription drug misuse, initiation and stabilization on both methadone and buprenorphine 
treatment, and remission.57 Participants in the survey were presented with vignettes describing the 
different states in terms of impacts on physical and emotional health, employment, family 
relationships, and criminal justice involvement. For the OUD state, we calculated a weighted 
average utility based on the reported utilities for active injection and prescription drug misuse and 
initiation with either methadone or buprenorphine treatment. We assumed that 18% of people 
with OUD are injection drug users and that an equal number of pe ople receiving MAT (25.1%) 
receive either methadone or buprenorphine.58 For the abstinence state, we calculated a weighted 
average utility based on the reported utilities for being in stable treatment with either methadone 
or buprenorphine and for remission. We assumed that 20.7% of those receiving MAT experience 
sustained re mission.50 These utilities were then converted to disutilities. Disutilities were calculated 
as the difference between the utility of a reference health state (representing the general 
population in the US) and the utility values assigned to specific disease states,  reflecting the 
decrement in quality of life. A utility score of 0.851 was used for the general population, based on 
 
©Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, 202 5 Page E5 
Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  the age - and sex -adjusted utility of individuals in the US.115 For OUD, the health state -specific 
disutility was calculated as 0.851 -0.62=0.231, and for the abstinence state, it was 0.851 -0.77=0.081.  
Caregiver disutilities were included in a scenario analysis. The study described above also measured 
the spillover utility of opioid misuse or MAT on the healthy spouse of someone with OUD.57 As 
described above, we calculated a weighted average of spouse utilities for active injection or 
prescription opioid use and the initiation stage of treatment with methadone or buprenorphine and 
converted to a disutility. We assumed an average of one care giver per patient. The disutility (0.064) 
was applied to the OUD health state.  
Adverse Events  
Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 2% or fewer of clinical trial participants prescribed 
suzetrigine or HB/APAP.116 Because we have not received data regarding the specific clinical nature 
of all short -term grade 3 or 4 adverse events, these are not included in the economic model. Long -
term adverse events of opioid use, specifically OUD, were included in the model.

Evidence  Report - Suzetrigine for Acute Pain  Return to Table of Contents  Direct Non -Drug Costs  
Excess health care costs for people with OUD were identified in a matched case -control study using 
administrative claims data across private and public payers and adjusted to represent the US 
population.60 This estimate includes the excess costs of inpatient, outpatient, and behavioral health 
care services such as MAT. For individuals in the abstinence state, we assumed ongoing MAT. The 
costs of treatment with methadone and buprenorphine, inclusive of integ rated psychosocial and 
medical support, were identified in a recent cost -effectiveness analysis of treatments for OUD.61 We 
assumed equal utilization of methadone and buprenorphine when calculating a weighted average 
cost of MAT. Gender - and age -specific unrelated health care costs were added to health states. 67 
Indirect Costs  
We identified the cost of lost productivity due to OUD as well as criminal justice costs associated with 
OUD. The cost of lost productivity reflects OUD -related absenteeism and decreases in labor force 
participation. The cost of lost productivity was included for the full lifetime of patients in the model. 
The criminal justice cost includes four components: police protection, legal and adjudication, 
correctional f acilities, and property lost due to crimes.

To demonstrate the effects of uncertainty on both costs and health outcomes, we varied input 
parameters using available estimates of parameter uncertainty (e.g., standard errors or plausible 
parameter ranges). Because suzetrigine  results in dominant (less costly, more effective) scenarios, 
we present a tornado diagram with incremental per person lifetime costs separate from 
incremental per person lifetime QALY and evLY estimates. Figures E4.2 and E4.3 present tornado 
diagrams resulting from the one -way sens itivity analyses for suzetrigine versus HB/APAP. Key 
drivers of cost -effectiveness estimates include the risk of OUD from a short course of HB/APAP, 
annual mean excess costs of OUD, and excess mortality related to OUD.

E5. Heterogeneity and Subgroups  
There were no pre -specified heterogeneity or subgroup analyses.  
Prior Economic Models  
While prior relevant economic models were designed to estimate the cost  effectiveness of medication 
assisted therapy (MAT) for OUD itself,61 the focus of this model was to examine the adverse effects of 
OUD on health outcomes and costs where an alternative therapy is available to HB/APAP or similar 
opioids. We did not find other acute pain models to compare to this model structure and analysis . 
However, in our model validation exercises we relied on existing observed longitudinal data sources to 
confirm transitions between no OUD, OUD, and abstinence from OUD. Health states were similar to 
other models including OUD, abstinence, and an increase d risk of mortality. However, where possible, 
we collapsed specific health states to include both in and out of treatment and calibrated model inputs 
to represent the broader OUD population. Our estimates are consistent with other OUD models in that 
outcom es for persons with OUD have excess costs, excess mortality, and decrements to quality of life.  
 
Table E 5.1. Model Revisions from Draft Report  
Change  Rationale  
The cost of suzetrigine was updated.  The manufacturer announced a wholesale acquisition 
cost for suzetrigine. In the model, this cost has 
replaced the placeholder price  used in the draft 
report . Updates include changes to the base -case

 F. Potential Budget Impact: Supplemental 
Information  
Methods  
We used results from the same model employed for the cost -effectiveness analyses to estimate 
total potential budget impact. Potential budget impact was defined as the total differential cost of 
using each new therapy rather than relevant existing therapy f or the treated population, calculated 
as differential health care costs (including drug costs) minus any offsets in these costs from averted 
health care events. All costs were undiscounted and estimated over one- and five -year -time  
horizons. The five -year timeframe was of primary interest, given the potential for cost offsets to 
accrue over time and to allow a more realistic impact on the number of patients treated with the 
new therapy.  
This potential budget impact analysis included the estimated number of individuals in the US who 
would be eligible for suzetrigine. To estimate the size of the potential candidate population, we 
used inputs for the US prevalence of acute pain requiring man agement with prescription 
medication. A retrospective cross -sectional study using two nationally representative datasets from 
2019 estimated that 80.2 million patients in the US annually experience acute pain, defined as 
requiring prescription pain medicat ion for less than three  months.2 Among all patients with acute 
pain, 10.9 million patients with both acute and chronic pain were excluded to ensure alignment 
with the specific population studied in the cost -effectiveness analysis. The prevalence of acute pain 
(69.3 million) was multiplie d by the proportion of acute pain patients who received one or more 
prescriptions or administrations of opioids (51%) to estimate the number of patients likely to 
receive opioids for treating acute pain each year. Other types of treatment, such as nonstero idal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and non -opioid analgesics, were not considered in estimating the 
number of eligible patients, as suzetrigine is anticipated to primarily displace opioids, which are the 
main comparator in the cost -effectiveness analysi s. Applying these findings results in estimates of 
35.3 million eligible patients in the US per year. For the purposes of this analysis, we will assume 
that 20% of these patients would initiate treatment in each of the five years, or 7.1 million patients 
per year .

Evidence  Report  – Suzetrigine for Acute Pain   Return to Table of Contents  
 ICER’s methods for estimating potential budget impact are described in detail elsewhere and have 
recently been updated.118,119 The intent of our revised approach to budgetary impact is to 
document the percentage of patients that could be treated at selected prices without crossing a 
budget impact threshold that is aligned with overall growth in the US economy.  
Once estimates of budget impact are calculated, we compare our estimates to an updated budget  
impact threshold that represents a potential trigger for policy mechanisms to improve affordability,  
such as changes to pricing, payment, or patient eligibility . As described in ICER’s Methods 
Presentation  (Value Assessment Framework), this threshold is based on an underlying assumption 
that health care costs should not grow much faster than growth in the overall national economy. 
From this foundational assumption, our potential budget impact threshold is d erived using an 
estimate of growth in US gross domestic product (GDP) +1%, the average number of new drug 
approvals by the FDA over the most recent two -year period, and the contribution of spending on 
retail and facility -based drugs to total health care sp ending.  
 
For 2023 -2024, therefore, the five -year annualized potential budget impact threshold that should 
trigger policy actions to manage access and affordability is calculated to total approximately $735 
million per year for new dru gs.
