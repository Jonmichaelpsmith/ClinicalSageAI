Concept, Safety and Efficacy Trial to Evaluate Different Oral Benznidazole 
Monotherapy and Benznidazole/E1224 Combination Regimens for the Treatment

Phase  Investigational ± Phase 2 trial  
Indication  Chronic Indeterminate Chagas Disease

Background 
Information 
and Trial 
Rationale The current treatment for Chagas disease has significant limitations, including long 
treatment durations, safety and tolerability concerns and is currently limited to two 
nitro-heterocyclic drugs, nifurtimox and benznidazole (BZN).  BZN, a nitroimidazole 
introduced by Roche in 1971, is marketed by Laboratório Farmacêutico do Estado 
de Pernambuco S/A ± LAFEPE and Laboratorio ELEA ± Argentina. It is supplied 
in tablets strengths of 12.5, 50 and 100 mg, administered twice daily at a dose of  5 mg/kg body weight/day for adults and 5-10 mg/kg body weight/day for children 
for 30-60 days. Notably, the current regimens with BZN for the treatment of adults 
with CD likely represent the maximum dosing case scenario in terms of dose, 
duration and schedule of administration (Chagas expert meeting DNDi. January 
2014. GVA). 
Doses and duration of treatment for CD have not been evaluated systematically. Current treatment regimens and dosing intervals have been derived from decades-
old patient series and with very limited direct comparisons. Data from recently concluded trials suggest existing opportunities for optimisation of the treatment 
regimens of BZN.  
A DNDi -sponsored Phase 2, proof- of-concept clinical trial on E1224 and BZN in 
adults with chronic indeterminate CD, conducted between 2011 and 2013 in Bolivia, showed that all BZN-treated patients had cleared parasite DNA after 2 weeks of treatment and 81% sustained the parasite clearance at 12 months after 
treatment. At end- of tre atment (EOT, Day 65), E1224 was found to be efficacious 
in clearing T. cruzi  parasites when compared to placebo. However, at 12 months 
less than one third of patients sustained parasite clearance. The trial safety data 
also indicated a proportion of patients (10-20%) who do not complete treatment in 
conditions of use, the majority due to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and the long treatment duration. 
Taking into consideration the efficacy gap with about 80% sustained response and 
a tolerability gap, with a proportion of patients (10-20%) who do not complete 
treatment, two approaches for Chagas treatment optimization are to be pursued: 
1) A change in the current adult dosing regimen for BNZ to reduce exposure and 
improve tolerability while maintaining efficacy; and 
2) The development of a combination therapy to improve efficacy while maintaining 
or improving tolerability. The combination therapy aims to address the efficacy gap 
and may or may not address tolerability gap. 
 
With regards to the  dosing regimen, population-pharmacokinetics studies   
observed BZN plasma concentrations in children were significantly lower than 
those previously reported in adults (treated with comparable mg/kg doses) . At the 
same time, all children had parasite clearance, few adverse reactions to the drug. 
Recent population PK data in adults suggested that the current BZN dosing 
Protocol number DNDi -CH-E1224 -003    
 May 04, 2018 .  Version  5.0.   
Confidential  Page 11 of 87 
 regimen (2.5 mg/kg/12 h) may lead to overexposure in the majority of patients . 
Dosing simulations suggested that a BNZ dose of 2.5 mg/kg/24 h would adequately 
keep BNZ trough plasma concentrations within the recommended target range for 
the majority of patients.  There are also opportunities for evaluation of fixed dose regimens for adult dosing, rather than mg/kg calculations, with increased ease- of-
use and potential for improved compliance in scaling up treatment of CD. Intermittent dosing regimens was also evaluated in murine model of chronic CD 
and in a pilot follow- up trial with 17 adult patients with chronic CD was, with similar 
parasitological cure rates to standard treatment. 
Likewise, several controlled observational trials with BZN, 5 mg/kg/day for 30 or 60 days have shown a reduction in the progression of heart disease serological and 
sero-negative conversion up to 60% in children and 30% in adults. Different 
publications showed anti-parasitic efficacy of treatment regimens with 30 and 60 
days, and of incomplete treatment of 10 days. Combination therapy is a well-
recognized treatment modality in many disease settings, including cancer , 
cardiovascular disease, and infectious diseases. Several infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, leprosy, and AIDS only came under control and were 
effectively treated after introduction of combinations of drugs that utilize different 
mechanisms of action. 
E1224 is a water-soluble monolysine salt form of the ravuconazole (RAV) pro-d rug 
(which is a phosphonooxymethyl ether derivative of RAV). It is a broad-spectrum 
triazole antifungal. 
 
Pooled safety data for the monolysine prodrug E1224 from Phase 1 and 2 trials 
indicated that E1224 was generally well tolerated and exhibited a safety profile 
quite similar to other azoles. Adverse events occurring in greater than 3% of E1224 recipients, with a dose-dependent pattern and at rates higher than those observed 
in placebo recipients included nausea, abnormalities in liver enzymes, dizziness, 
anxiety, and contact dermatitis. 
Safety evaluations indicated relatively mild, transient, and asymptomatic increases 
in liver enzymes ± completely reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. Phase 1 
cardiac safety evaluations showed that E1224 administration did not result in QTc 
interval prolongation. 
Experimental data suggest a positive interaction between BZN and azole 
compounds for the treatment of Chagas disease.
18  
A Phase 1 drug-drug interaction trial was designed to assess the pharmacokinetics 
(PK) and safety interaction of BNZ and E1224 co-administered daily for a total of 
54 days (Day 4 to Day 15- E1224 multiple dose 400 mg loading dose once daily 
for 3 days, followed by maintenance dose 100mg once daily for 9 days (from Day 7 
to Day 15); Day 9 BNZ single dose (2.5 mg/kg); and Day 12 to Day 15 BNZ multiple dose (2.5 mg/kg twice daily)).  The trial was conducted in Argentina and was concluded in early 2015, with enrolment of 28 healthy male volunteers . Both 
compounds were well tolerated, in monotherapy and combination. There were no treatment discontinuations or serious adverse events. Transient, minor, non-
concomitant increase in bilirubin and liver transaminases occurred in 2 patients in 
a pattern not suggestive of drug effect. There was no interaction of RAV on BNZ 
PK and the limited impact of BNZ on RAV PK, suggesting that co-administration of 
RAV and BNZ may not require any E1224 dosing adaptation. The lack of clinically 
relevant safety findings provided support for follow-up evaluation of the two 
compounds in combination. 
In conclusion, recent scientific advances have provided further impetus to develop 
new therapeutic approaches for CD using different doses and duration of BZN, as 
well as combinations directed at multiple therapeutic targets to improve treatment response and tolerability and reduce the potential for development of resistance.  
This project focuses on the proof- of-concept evaluation of improved treatment

 regimens of BZN, with the assessment of new BZN-sparing regimens in 
monotherapy and in combination with E1224. 
Trial 
Objectives General Objective: 
To determine the efficacy and safety of different dosing regimens of BZN and 
BZN/E1224 in combination (BZN/E1224) in reducing and clearing  T. cruzi  
parasitemia in individuals with the chronic indeterminate CD.  
 
Primary Objectives: 
x To determine the efficacy of different dosing regimens of orally 
administered BZN and BZN/E1224 in individuals with chronic indeterminate 
CD, by determining the proportion of patients who convert from positive to 
negative in serial, qualitative PCR test results (3 negative PCR results) at 
end of treatment (EOT) and sustain parasitological clearance at 6 months 
of follow-up, in comparison to placebo. 
 
Secondary Objectives:  
x To measure the reduction in parasite load at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 12 and 
at 4, 6 and 12 months follow-up, as measured by quantitative PCR.  
x To assess the time to parasite DNA clearance (below the quantitative PCR 
[qPCR ] Limit of Detection [ LOD]) for each of the regimens  
x To assess the sustained parasitological response at week 12, and 12 
months for each of the regimens, in comparison with placebo.   
x To assess the time to sustained clearance of parasitemia for each of the 
treatment regimens.  
x To determine the efficacy of the different dosing regimens in individuals with 
chronic indeterminate CD, by determining the proportion of patients who 
convert from positive to negative in serial, qualitative PCR test results (3 
negative PCR results) at EOT, in comparison with placebo.  
x To explore if there is a dose-response relationship between the dose of 
treatment given and parasite clearance in order to determine the minimum 
effective dose. 
x To evaluate serological response by conventional serology at 12 months of 
follow up and non-conventional serology at W12, 4M, 6M, and 12 months 
of follow up.  
x To characterize the population pharmacokinetic parameters of orally 
administered BZN and BZN/E1224 in adults with chronic indeterminate CD.  
x To evaluate the safety profile of different regimens based on clinical, 
laboratory measurements, and EKG.  
x To correlate pharmacokinetic parameters with parasitological response and 
safety outcomes.  
x To evaluate the incidence of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and/or 
adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment.  
 
Trial Endpoints  Primary efficacy assessment parameter:  
x Parasitological response as determined by serial negative qualitative PCR 
results (3 negative PCR results, from 3 samples to be collected in the same 
day) at EOT and sustained parasitological clearance until 6 months follow-
up.  
For efficacy assessments, the EOT of each treatment arm will be defined in

 Trial Design  Double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, prospective, comparative, placebo-
controlled, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic, and proof- of-concept trial design, 
with seven-parallel groups. 
 
The trial will be conducted in 3 sites in Bolivia .  
 
The trial will be sufficiently powered to compare the efficacy and safety of each of 
the dosing regimens of BZN and the combination BZN/E1224, with placebo.  
Primary efficacy analyses will be performed when all patients complete 6 months follow-up visit. Efficacy and safety database until 6 months will be locked. Analyses 
of results will be used to guide planning of follow-up Phase 3 clinical study. Sponsor 
personnel directly involved in the trial, principal investigators and study team site 
personnel will remain blinded to treatment allocation and results of the analyses.  
 
Efficacy and s afety will be monitored by an external independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (DMC) on an ongoing basis. The committee is to include cardiac and 
liver safety experts, as well as CD clinical expertise. 
 
Randomization, Blinding and Code Breaking 
 
Each patient will be assigned with a treatment number according to the 
randomization schedule. The trial drug label will indicate the trial number, trial site 
and patient treatment numbers (according to local regulations), but will not indicate 
the actual designation of treatment. 
 
 
Code breaking can only be performed if a life-threatening / emergency condition 
depends on the information about the treatment allocation. In case of any need of 
un-blinding, the sponsor (DNDi clinical trial manager or monitor) must be contacted 
immediately, ideally before doing so.

Concomitant treatment :  
Patients are allowed to receive concomitant therapy for medical occurrences during the course of the trial. However, specific compounds that interact with the trial 
drugs, increase the liver enzymes, are immunosuppressants or have a known

Hormonal contraceptives are allowed during the trial. However, as the 
contraceptive efficacy is decreased due to interaction with Ravuconazole, a double 
method is recommended (section 7.6.8 .)  
All concomitant medications taken by the patient during the trial, from the date of

 A total of 210 patients will be recruited in the trial .  
 
For a comparison of two independent binomial proportions using Pearson's Chi-
square statistic with a Chi-square approximation with a two-sided significance level of 0.006 (multiplicity adjustment of 0.05 for 6 comparisons [treated arms] against 
the control arm), a sample size of 11 patients per arm assuming a balanced design achieves a power of at least 0.8 when the proportions are 0.082 (control arm) and 
0.81 (treatment arm). Alpha-adjustment to 0.0 25 is considered for interim analyses 
to account for potential inflation of Type I error. 
 
With an estimated proportion of 10% patients who would drop-out from the trial, the 
final sample size needed is 12 patients per arm for one comparison.  
 
A sample size of 30 patients per arm will allow a 99% probability of observing at 
least one event of peripheral neuropathy or paresthesia, transaminase increase, 
hypersensitivity (13.3%, 15.5%, and 22.2 %, respectively), and 85% probability of 
observing at least one treatment discontinuation per arm. 
 
Indications for 
early treatment 
discontinuation Efficacy and safety will be reviewed by the established Data Monitoring Committee 
(DMC), as defined in the DMC charter.  
 
An efficacy interim analysis will be performed when 30% of patients completed 12 
weeks from treatment initiation. A futility stopping rule is defined by a lack of 
significant difference to placebo in the sustained parasitological response at 12 
weeks. The stopping rule will be applied with no change planned on the sample 
size. Alpha-adjustment to 0.0 25 is considered to account for potential inflation of 
Type I error. Patients will be considered early treatment failures. 
 For safety, upon completion of treatment of 20% of recruited patients, a safety 
interim analysis will be performed.  
 
Liver safety criteria: 
 
Discontinuation of treatment should be considered if: 
 ALT oU AST >8[ULN  (to be reported as Adverse Event of Special Interest) 
 ALT oU AST >5[ULN foU moUe Whan 2 ZeekV

 ALT  or AST >3xULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right 
upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%)   
Liver enzymes will be repeated as soon as possible after the initial abnormality is 
identified. After that, the patient should be followed every 96 hours (4 days), or 
the closest possible interval, until the serum ALT and/or AST falls below 3 X ULN

All data on liver safety will be presented to the DMC for review. 
 
Cardiac safety: 
Patients will be monitored regularly for vital signs and electrocardiographic 
abnormalities (see Table 1 ± Schedule of Events). Patients will be re-dosed only 
following on-site physician review of available EKGs (central reading). Specific 
criteria for treatment discontinuation are described in Section 9 of the trial protocol. 
 
Any patient with a delta QTc > 60 msec post dosing will have the trial medication 
permanently interrupted and will follow the standard trial schedule. For the cases 
where in addition to the delta QTc > 60 msec post-dosing, cardiac symptoms are 
present, an EKG should be performed as soon as possible. 
 
Echocardiography will be performed on any patients with any clinically significant 
change in the EKG and in patients with AEs determined to be of cardiac etiology. 
Holter monitoring will be carried out in patients with symptoms or EKG evidence of arrhythmia.  
 
Cardiac safety experts will periodically review all EKGs and present information to 
the DMC. Central reading of the EKGs will be utilized for the EKG database. In 
addition, the cardiac safety expert will review all Cardiac System Organ Class 
(SOC) AEs; and all non-Cardiac SOC, but potential Cardiac AEs.  
 
A DMC will review cardiac safety information on an ongoing basis, as prescribed

 1. BACKGROUND AND TRIAL  RATIONALE  
Chagas disease (CD) is a disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) , ranking among 
Whe ZoUld¶V moVW neglecWed diVeaVeV. In LaWin AmeUica, 21 coXnWUieV aUe endemic foU CD ZiWh an 
estimated 70 million people at risk of contracting the disease1. Estimates from the 1980s indicated 
that some 16 million to 18 million individuals were infected. In the 1990s, after a series of multinational 
control initiatives, estimates of the number of infected people were revised to 9.8 million in 2001. The 
estimated burden of disease in terms of disability -adjusted life years (DALYs) declined fr om 2.7 million 
in 1990 to 586,000 in 2001. Recent estimates from PAHO (2015) indicate about 6 million infected 
people2 and 29,925  new cases of vector transmission per year.  
The current treatment for Chagas disease has significant limitations, including lo ng treatment 
durations, safety and tolerability concerns and is currently limited to two nitro -heterocyclic drugs, 
nifurtimox and benznidazole (BZN).  BZN, a nitroimidazole introduced by Roche in 1971, is now 
marketed by Laboratório Farmacêutico do Estado de Pernambuco S/A ± LAFEPE and Laboratorio 
ELEA ± Argentina. It is supplied in tablets strengths of 12.5 mg, 50 and 100 mg and administered 
twice daily at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight/day for adults and 5 -10 mg/kg body weight/day for 
children for 30 -60 da ys. Notably, the current regimens with BZN for the treatment of adults with CD 
likely represent the maximum dosing case scenario in terms of dose, duration and schedule of 
administration (Chagas expert meeting DNDi. January 2014. Geneva ). 
Lack of convincin g and consistent data on efficacy and concerns about safety and tolerability 
profiles have limited the widespread implementation of BZN treatments. Despite being available since 
the early 70s, treatment recommendations vary significantly from country to co untry and the 
comparative evidence -base with the current treatment regimens is limited.   
Doses and duration of treatment for CD has not been evaluated systematically. Current 
treatment regimens and dosing intervals have been derived from decades -old patien t series and with 
very limited direct comparisons. Data from recently concluded trials  suggest existing opportunities for 
optimisation of BZN treatment regimens.  
From 2011 to 2013, a DNDi -sponsored Phase 2, proof -of-concept clinical trial on E1224 and 
BZN in adults with chronic indeterminate CD was conducted in Bolivia assessing different dosing 
regimen of E1224 given for 4 to 8 weeks and benznidazole standard regi men against placebo. The 
trial provided clear efficacy and safety information on the two compounds to support further clinical 
development and access3. After one week of treatment, mean qPCR repeated measures analyses 
showed a significant difference in par asite load vs. placebo in all treatment arms. All BZN -treated 
patients had cleared parasite DNA after 2 weeks of treatment. At end -of treatment (EOT, Day 65), 
E1224 was found to be efficacious in clearing T. cruzi  parasites when compared to placebo. Six 
months after treatment, 22-33% of patients receiving E1224 low dose and short duration and 60% of 
those receving high dose E1224 sustained parasite clearance compared with 95.6% of patients 
treated with BZN  Of note, the large majority of treatment failures were identified up to  6 month follow -
up visit.  
Protocol number DNDi -CH-E1224 -003    
 May 04, 2018 .  Version  5.0.   
Confidential  Page 24 of 87 
 Although E1224 was found to have limited efficacy as a single -treatment agent, it holds 
promise for use in combination with existing drugs, since it showed s trong positive activity during 
treatment, with a third of patients having a sustained treatment response at the higher dose.  
Safety analyses showed that the most common BZN related AEs were nausea (20%), 
dermatologic AEs (11.1%), hypersensitivity reaction s (24.4%), headache (24.4%), and neuropathy 
(11.1%), with a time -course pattern for development of treatment emergent adverse events. Gastro -
intestinal disturbances and hypersensitivity reactions were the first to occur, followed by liver enzyme 
abnormalit ies, while most cases of neuropathy occurred after 30 days of treatment.  Around 9% of 
patients in the BZN arm had elevated transaminases and hypersensitivity reactions leading to 
treatment discontinuation. In the E1224 treatment groups, there was a dose -dependent increase in 
AEs, including headache (24.4%), nausea (15.6%) and liver enzyme elevations (ALT (22.2%) and 
AST (17.8%).  
These data suggest that BZN is rapidly effective, however there is both an efficacy gap with 
about 80% sustained response at 12 m onths and a tolerability gap, with a proportion of patients (10-
20%) who do not complete treatment in conditions of use, the majority due to adverse drug reactions 
(ADRs) and the long treatment duration (see Figure 1).  
 
Figure 1: Current treatment for Chag as with BNZ  
 
Between April 2008 and November 2010 a prospective population -pharmacokinetics cohort 
trial4 condXcWed aW Whe PaUaViWolog\ and ChagaV SeUYice, BXenoV AiUeV ChildUen¶V HoVSiWal µµR 
GXWieUUe]¶¶ enUolled 40 childUen beWZeen 2 and 12 \eaUV of age ZiWh  CD.  The observed BZN plasma 
concentrations in children were significantly lower than those previous ly reported in adults (treated 
with comparable mg/kg doses), possibly due to a higher  weight -corrected clearance rate (CL/F) in 
smaller children. The lower blood concentrations were nevertheless associated to parasite clearance 
in all children, measured by  PCR. Unlike adults, children had few adverse reactions to the drug, 
suggesting that there may be a direct correlation between drug concentrations and incidence of ADRs. 
A second trial, sponsored by DNDi, testing the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relatio nship using 
the 12.5mg new p aediatric dosage form and enrolling a total of 81 children from birth to 12 years of 
age in multiple p aediatric centres in Argentina (PED -CHAGAS network), confirmed this pattern5. 
Recent population PK data in adults further char acterized BNZ PK in adults with chronic 
Chagas disease and suggested that the current BZN dosing regimen (2.5 mg/kg/12 h) may lead to 

Protocol number DNDi -CH-E1224 -003    
 May 04, 2018 .  Version  5.0.   
Confidential  Page 25 of 87 
 overexposure in the majority of patients. Dosing simulations suggested that a BNZ dose of 2.5 
mg/kg/24 h would adequately keep BNZ trough plasma concentrations within the recommended target 
range for the majority of patients6.  There are also opportunities for evaluation of fixed dose regimens 
for adult dosing, rather than mg/kg calculations, with increased ease -of-use and po tential for improved 
compliance in scaling up treatment of CD.  
Likewise, several controlled observational trials  with BZN, 5 mg/kg/day for 30 or 60 days 
have shown a reduction in the progression of heart disease serological and sero -negative conversion 
up to 60% in children and 30% in adults7,8,9,10,11,12,13. Different publications showed anti -parasitic 
efficacy of treatment regimens with 30 and 60 days14,15 and of incomplete treatment of 10 days16.  
Additional experimental data suggest other opportunities for alternative dosing regimens of 
BZN. Bustamante et al. showed that intermittent BZN administration had similar parasitological cure 
rates to standard treatment, in a stringent murine model of chro nic CD 17. A pilot follow -up trial was 
conducted in Argentina by Viotti, Sosa -Estani, and colleagues to evaluate a BZN treatment regimen 
with intermittent doses of 5 mg/kg/day, taken at 5 -day intervals, during 60 days in 17 adult patients 
with chronic CD. P reliminary results show a high proportion of end of treatment clearance of 
parasitemia with this regimen, in line with historical data on standard BZN treatment.  
Taking into consideration these results, two approaches for Chagas treatment optimization 
are to be pursued (Figure 2): 1) Changing current adult dosing regimen for BNZ to reduce exposure 
and improve tolerability while maintaining efficacy; and, 2) Development of a combination therapy to 
improve efficacy while maintaining or improving tolerability.  The former does not address the existing 
efficacy gap. Combination therapy aims to address the efficacy gap and may or may not address 
tolerability gap.

The causative agent of CD, T. cruzi,  has been c alled Whe ³cUX]i comSle[´ becaXVe of Whe 
considerable genetic polymorphism observed between parasite populations.  The T. cruzi  genome is 
quite diverse, with multiple genotypes and phenotypes. Distinct populations correlate with geographic 
differences in t he pathology of the disease and its response to chemotherapy.   
Natural resistance of T. cruzi  to nitro derivatives has been described and is considered to be 
one of the factors explaining the variable response rates detected in treating CD patients. Acqui red

 resistance has also been reported while on benznidazole (BZN) therapy. Drug susceptibility varies 
widely depending upon direct typing units (DTUs), geographic location, host factors, and prior therapy 
used.  
Treatment of virtually every infectious dise ase begins with empiric therapy intended to cover 
the broadest possible spectrum of pathogens likely to cause the infection. Therapy is then narrowed 
once the etiologic pathogen is identified and the drug susceptibility pattern is determined.  
In routine t reatment of chronic indeterminate CD, identification of the specific etiologic 
pathogen is almost never possible. Also,  there is evidence that more than one parasite lineage can 
cause an infection in a single patient.  
Combination therapy is a well -recogni zed treatment modality in many disease settings, 
including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and infectious diseases. Several infectious diseases. such 
as tuberculosis, malaria, leprosy, and AIDS, only came under control and were effectively treated only 
after introduction of combinations of drugs that utilize different mechanisms of action.  
E1224 is a water -soluble monolysine salt form of the ravuconazole (RAV) pro -drug (which is 
a phosphonooxymethyl ether derivative of RAV). It is a broad -spectrum triazole antifungal. RAV was 
evaluated extensively in animal models and in human trials including Phase 2 safety and efficacy 
trials in oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis and onychomycosis, and for prevention of 
invasive fungal infections in hematopoietic ste m cell transplant recipients.  
 E1224 is rapidly converted to RAV in vivo: data from both preclinical and clinical evaluations 
of RAV are therefore considered relevant to E1224. E1224 is available as oral formulations (100 
capsules). It has completed gener al toxicology and safety pharmacology trials , as well as five Phase 
1 clinical trials : ascending, single and multiple loading and maintenance dose, bioavailability, and 
food-effect trial; ascending, multiple loading and maintenance dose trial of E1224 administered 
intravenously over 14 days; effect of E1224 on cytochrome P450 enzymes; and cardiac 
safety/thorough QTc trial.  
Pharmacokinetic trials  showed that E1224 is rapidly converted to RAV with a peak 
concentration at 2.5 to 6 hours post -dose with a long terminal half -life of 7.7 to 10.5 days. RAV 
accumulated over time (AUC on Day 1 < Day 7 and 14). With a loading and maintenance dose 
strategy, a steady state level at desired peak concentrations of RAV can be achieved within 7 days 
of initial  dosing.   
Safety evaluations indicated relatively mild, transient, and asymptomatic increases in liver 
enzymes ± completely reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. Phase 1 cardiac safety evaluations 
showed that E1224 administration did not result in Q Tc interval prolongation. Mean QTcF interval was 
shortened compared to baseline, with peak effect on QTc interval at 1 and 1.5 hours post -dosing and 
mean change from baseline of -16.9 to -19.4 msec. QT remained within normal limits and there was 
no dose -response relationship to these changes at steady -state. Findings resolved spontaneously by 
4 hours after dosing. Expert review indicated the unknown relevance of the cardiac safety findings.

 Pooled safety data for the monolysine prodrug E1224 from Phase 1 and 2 trials  indicated 
that E1224 was generally well tolerated and exhibited a safety profile quite similar to other azoles. 
Adverse events occurring in greater than 3% of E1224 recipients, w ith a dose -dependent pattern and 
at rates higher than those observed in placebo recipients included nausea, abnormalities in liver 
enzymes, dizziness, anxiety, and contact dermatitis.   
These data indicate that E1224, unlike some other azole antifungal com pounds ,18,19,20 does 
not prolong QTc. Shortening of QTc has been reported for a few compounds21. E1224 was generally 
well tolerated, with the exception of modest increases in liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and alkaline 
phosphatase).  
The results of a pre - and postnatal development study in rats, a 26 -week rat toxicity (tox) 
study, and a 39 -week toxicology study in monkeys have shown the following results:  
● In the pre - and postnatal development study in rats, the no -observable -adverse -effect 
level (NOAEL) for F 0 maternal general toxicity and reproductive function was 27.4 mg/kg. The NOAEL 
for F1 development was 8.2 mg/kg. The NOAEL for F1 reproductive function and F2 embryo 
development was 109.4 mg/kg.  
● Results from the 26 -week rat tox study (dosed at 0, 10, 30 , and 60 mg/kg/day) revealed 
no death or moribundity related to the test article. There were no changes in clinical signs, body 
weight, food consumption, ophthalmoscopy, or urinalysis. There were increased adrenal weights in 
females at ≥30 mg/kg, increased  adrenal vacuolation of cortical cells in both sexes at ≥30 mg/kg, 
and decreased triglycerides in males at 60 mg/kg. Based on these results, the NOAEL was considered 
to be 10 mg/kg.  
● Results from the 39 -week toxicity study in monkeys with ravuconazole dos es of 1 to 30 
mg/kg revealed no death or moribundity related to the test article. No changes were observed in 
clinical signs or food consumption, though one male monkey in the 30 mg/kg dose group 
demonstrated gradual body weight decrease throughout the dos ing period ( -11%, vs pre -dosing). 
There were no changes in ophthalmoscopy, ECG, urinalysis, or hematology measurements. Gross 
findings showed enlarged liver and adrenals. The histopathological changes in liver appeared to be 
related to adaptive hepatocellu lar hypertrophy. These findings were comparable to those observed in 
the previous 4 - and 13 -week toxicity studies at doses of 5 and 30 mg/kg. These were adaptive 
changes related to hepatic enzyme induction, and no evidence of progression or increased sever ity 
was observed after 39 weeks of administration. In the adrenal glands, increased vacuolation of the 
cortical cells in males at 30 mg/kg and females at 5 and 30 mg/kg; this was an expected class effect 
of azoles. A 3 - to 4-fold increase in triglycerides was noted in the 30 mg/kg dose male monkeys 
compared to control. Based on these results, NOAEL was considered to be 5 mg/kg for males and 1 
mg/kg for females.  
Experimental data suggest a positive interaction between BZN and azole compounds for the 
treatmen t of Chagas disease18. BZN and posaconazole (POS) were administered individually or in 
Protocol number DNDi -CH-E1224 -003    
 May 04, 2018 .  Version  5.0.   
Confidential  Page 28 of 87 
 combination in an experimental acute murine infection model. Using a rapid treatment protocol for 7 
days, the combined treatments were more efficacious in reducing paras itemia levels than the drugs 
given alone, with the effects most evident in combinations of sub -optimal doses of the drugs. The 
curative action of these drug combinations was investigated, using the same infection model and 25, 
50, 75 or 100 mg/kg/day (mpk)  of BZN in combination with 5, 10 or 20 mpk of POS , given alone or 
concomitantly for 20 days. The effects of the combination treatments on parasitological cures were 
higher than the sum of such effects when the drugs were administered separately at the sam e doses, 
indicating a positive interaction. Similar results were seen with combination treatment of E1224 and 
BZN in T.cruzi  murine infection22. 
A Phase 1 drug -drug interaction trial was designed to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) and 
safety interaction of BNZ and E1224 co -administered daily for a total of 54 days (Day 4 to Day 15) 
E1224 multiple dose 400  mg loading dose once daily for 3 days, followed by maintenance dose 100 
mg once  daily for 9 days (from Day  7 to Day  15); Day 9 BNZ single dose (2.5 mg/kg); and Day 12 to 
Day 15  BNZ multiple dose (2.5 mg/kg twice daily).   The trial was conducted in Argentina and was 
concluded in early 2015, with enrolment of 28 healthy male volunteers . Both compounds were well 
tolerated, in monotherapy and combination. There were no treatment discontinuations or serious 
adverse events. Transient, minor, non -concomitant increase in bilirubin and liver transaminases 
occurred in 2 patients in a pattern no t suggestive of drug effect. There was no interaction of RAV on 
BNZ PK and the limited impact of BNZ on RAV PK, suggesting that co -administration of RAV and 
BNZ may not require any E1224 dosing adaptation. The lack of clinically relevant safety findings 
provided support for follow -up evaluation of the two compounds in combination.  
In conclusion, recent scientific advances have provided further impetus to develop new 
therapeutic approaches for CD using different doses and duration of BZN, as well as combinat ions 
directed at multiple therapeutic targets to improve treatment response and tolerability and reduce the 
potential for development of resistance.  
This project focuses on the proof -of-concept evaluation of improved treatment regimens of 
BZN, with the assessment of new BZN -sparing regimens in monotherapy and in combination with 
E1224.

 This trial is designed as a double -blind, double -dummy, randomised, prospective, 
comparative, placebo -controlled, pharmacokinetic -pharmacodynamic and proof -of-concept trial 
design, with seven -parallel groups.  
During this trial, population PK evaluations of Benznidazole and E1224  and 
pharmacokinetic -pharmacodynamic assessments will be performed.  
This trial, that aims to determine whether at least one of seven dosing regimens of orally 
administered BZN and BZN/E1224  is more appropriate with regards to efficacy and safety when 
compared to placebo , will be conducted in  three  sites in Bolivia.  
The sites were selected for this Phase 2 trial based on  significant disease burden , the 
necessary expertise, excell ence of care of Chagas patients, established infrastructure  and 
previous experience in conducting clinical trials according to GCP .

Primary efficacy analyses will be performed when all patients complete the 6 months 
follow -up visit. Efficacy and safety database until 6 months will be locked. Analyses of results will 
be used to guide planning of a follow -up Phase 3 clinical study. Sponsor personnel  directly 
involved in the clinical trial , principal investigato rs and study team site personnel will remain 
unequivocally blinded to treatment allocation and results of the analyses.  
Efficacy and s afety will be monitored by an external independent DMC , on an ongoing 
basis. The committee is to include cardiac and live r safety expert s, as well as Chagas Disease  
expertise  (see section 11).  
 
3.2. Trial  duration and duration of patient participation  
 
The total duration of patient participation in the trial will be approximately  13 months, 
considering up to  40 days for screening, 8 weeks of treatment, and follow -up visits up to 12 
months after treatment initiation.  
Following written, voluntary informed consent, patients will initiate a 40-day screening 
phase. Once a patient is randomized at D1, s/he will have fo llow-up visits during the treatment 
phase of the trial at Day 1, 2, 3, (allowable window of + 2 days for day 3 only) and at weekly 
intervals at week 2 (allowable window of + 3 days), weeks 3 -10 (allowable window of ± 3 days), 
and after 4, 6, and 12 months after treatment initiation (allowable window of ± 7 days).  
In addition, patients will be advised to return on any day during the follow -up period if they 
present any medical occurrence or adverse event.

 Patient recruitment is expected to occur within 10 months of recruitment initiation . 
Therefore, the timeline of First Patient In (FPI) and Last Patient Out (LPO) is 22 months. However, 
the total trial duration is estimated to be 28 months, from start -up phase to final trial report.  
 
3.3. Rationale of trial design  
 
The selection of a placebo -controlled Phase 2 clinical trial design was based on the 
requirements for well -controlled proof -of-concept, efficacy and safety data for Benznidazole and 
Beznnidazole/E1224  for this therapeutic indication.  
The choice of the CD target population was largely driven by the unmet medical need for 
a new, safe and effective treatment for chronic indeterminate CD. Adults with chronic 
indeterminate CD are recognized as the population with the most urgent requirements for the 
development of new treatments.  Drugs employed in children, with acute and early chronic CD 
are more often efficacious and better tolerated, with less than 10% of patients presenting serious 
adverse events.   
Moreover, with a decreasing incidence and existi ng patterns of disease presentation, the 
highest disease burden is found in patients in the chronic indeterminate phase of the disease.  
CD is seldom diagnosed in the acute phase, with circulating parasites identifiable by optical 
microscopy, with the exce ption of congenital cases, immunosuppressed patients and the small 
clusters of oral transmission.  Carrying out rigorous clinical trials in any of these populations would 
present ethical and logistical challenges (in light of high response rates to benznid azole in 
congenital disease), confounding elements (due to the severity of disease and need for frequent 
concomitant medications in the case of immunosuppressed patients) and feasibility issues (due 
to the small numbers and dispersed nature of most cluster s of oral transmission in the Amazon 
region).  
The efficacy of this indication will be assessed through sustained parasitological response 
over six months measured by serial negative qualitative PCRs as the primary endpoint. Clinical 
CD related events occur at a low incidence in this population and would thus require very large 
clinical trials to assess incidence changes and serological endpoints would require several y ears 
to decades in chronic CD. Recently concluded clinical trials provide support for the selected 
endpoint and timelines for assessment  in proof -of-concept . 
The secondary endpoints will assess the sustained parasitemia at 12 months and the time 
to clearan ce of parasitemia by serial ne gative qualitative PCR results , comparing each of the six 
dosing regimens relative to placebo, notably assessment of parasite load over time, conventional 
and non-conventional serology . Parasite clearance data will  be correlated with pharmacokinetic 
parameters.  
The evaluation of cure is considered to be the most complex aspect of treatment 
assessment in CD.  Parasitological cure is difficult to interpret and its evaluation is challenging in 
Protocol number DNDi -CH-E1224 -003    
 May 04, 2018 .  Version  5.0.   
Confidential  Page 33 of 87 
 light of the need for tot al elimination of parasites, not only from the blood but also from tissues 
where it is not measurable.  Assessment of parasitological cure requires long -term follow -up 
because of the pathogenesis and hysteresis of the disease, the characteristics of the pa rasite, 
the host response times, and the consequent clinical manifestations.  Such changes occur over 
long periods of time.   
A negative direct blood smear at the end of treatment is generally accepted as evidence 
of a favorable  response in acute CD patien ts. In chronic disease, serial hemocultures, 
xenodiagnosis, or PCR have been used to support the serological assessment, and a positive 
parasitological diagnostic test result indicates treatment failure.  Hemoculture and xenodiagnosis 
are techniques that re quire proper resources/infrastructure and very ski llful and experienced 
personnel to adequately perform them. With regard to conventional serology, for chronic 
indeterminate CD patients, seroconversion to negative would occur after 5 to 10 years (although 
cases with a longer period for conversion to negative have been described). Therefore, for the 
purposes of clinical development and proof -of-concept, it has been proposed that qualitative and 
quantitative PCR parasitological tests be used as markers for ef ficacy in clinical trials  of chronic 
indeterminate CD.   
Important considerations have included the significant variability in the clinical sensitivity 
and specificity of PCR tests observed in early published trials , with differences seen across all 
phases  of the disease and across a number of techniques in use that require standardization.  In 
particular, there has been concern regarding the sensitivity of PCR in chronic CD due to low 
levels of circulating parasites and natural fluctuations in parasitemia.  In a recent comparison of 
two diagnostic techniques in patients with chronic CD, PCR had high specificity (100%) and 
moderate sensitivity (70% to 75%).  
The latest PCR trials  have shown higher sensitivity, with a broad dynamic range for PCR 
use allowing di rect measurements in cases with high parasitic loads such as in 
immunosuppressed CD patients and congenitally infected newborns, as well as in cases with low 
parasitic loads, such as patients in the chronic indeterminate phase or who are receiving 
antipara sitic treatment.  
An important advance in recent years has been the trial sponsored by UNICEF/UNDP/ 
World Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) for 
the standardization and laboratory validation of qualitative PCR te sting for T. cruzi .  Standardized 
procedures for the qualitative assessment of PCR (standard and real -time) testing with higher 
analytical sensitivity and specificity, reproducibility, and low levels of intra - and inter -assay 
variation and high levels of a ccuracy have been selected.    
During expert panel discussions and with support from recent data on DNDi sponsored 
trials , there is consensus on the value of using serial, sequential blood collections for qualitative 
and quantitative PCR assays in order to increase PCR test sensitivity and evaluate durability of 
response.  The proposed trial will incorporate the standardized  and optimi zed procedures for

 6. ENROLMENT PROCEDURES   
Patient s presenting at the trial sites will undergo the routine assessments, including 
complete medical history, physical examination , CD conventional serology , hematology  and 
biochemistry  tests.  
Adult patient s >18 and <50 years  with serology tests confirming a diagnosis of T. cruzi 
infection and fulfilling screening criteria will be invited to participate in the trial through the 
informed consent process.  In order for the patient  to be enrolled in the trial, the informed 
consen t form must be obtained from the patient by the Principal Investigator or the delegated 
trial team member prior to any trial specific procedure.  
The participating site must complete a Patient  Screening/Enrolment Log to reflect 
screening number, enrolment status,  date of enrolment, trial enrolment number , and reason 
for not enrolling, whenever applicable.  Enrolment and screening procedures should occur up 
to 40 days or less (i.e. , ±D40 to D0) from the intended initiation of trial therapy. Patient s fulfilling 
entry criteria will go through the randomisation procedures. Only patient s randomized into the 
trial will receive trial medications and will be assigned  a trial identification number.  
 A patient  will have fulfilled participation in the clinical trial after completion of the last 
protoc ol-specified contact , i.e. the 12-month visit.

 All treatment arms consider the  regimens in fixed doses. The doses of Benznidazole 
were defined taking as reference the guidelines for the standard treatment of CD, which 
recommend 5  mg/kg/day of BZN for 60 days. Considering an average weight of 60 kg, the 
fixed dose would be 300 mg dai ly. With the proposed prescription, patient s¶ daily dose s will 
vary as follows:  
 
Patients' Weight 
range 50kg to 80 kg 
Dosing group Actual total daily dose 
(mg/kg/day) 
300 mg - 5.0 mg/kg 3.75 mg/kg to 6 mg/kg 
150 mg - 2.5 mg/kg 1.88 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg 
 
At the weekly visits, E1224  or E1224 ±matched placebos  will be administered under 
the supervision of trial staff. T he patient  will receive enough BZN or BZN matched placebos  
until the next scheduled visit.  Also, they must bring all remaining trial drugs to check for 
compliance with prescribed treatment and ensure drug accountability.  
If a patient  misses a dose or vomits within 30 minutes of undertaking the treatment,  
the dose may be re ±administered . 
As per recommended in the ABARAX ® package insert, patients will be advised to 
abstain from alcohol during treatment.  
 
Rescue treatment:  
At the end of the study, patients will receive the information related to what study 
treatment they took and the PCR results.  
All patient s treated with placebo will be offered BZN treatment at 5 mg/kg/day, divided 
in two daily doses for 60 days.  
For all other patient s, except those treated with BZN standard regimen, who remain 
PCR positive at end of trial, BZN treatment will be offered at 5 mg/kg/day, divided in two daily 
doses for 60 days.  
For all patient s treated with BZN standard regimen who remain PCR positive at end 
of trial NFX treatment will be offered at doses of 10 -15 mg/Kg/day, divided in two -three daily 
administrations for 60 days.  
Patient s who do not tolerate the trial treatment will be withdrawn from the trial and will

 be offered an alternative treatment with NFX 10 -15 mg/Kg/day, divided in two -three daily doses 
for 60 days.  
 
7.3. Drugs labelling, packaging  
 
Minimum information  to be  included on the trial medication label will be:  
 Name of SSonVoU  
 Trial protocol number  
 Treatment number  
 PhaUmaceXWical doVage foUm, UoXWe of adminiVWUaWion, TXanWiW\ of doVage XniWV  
 ³FoU clinical WUial XVe onl\´  
 E[SiU\ daWe and VWoUage condiWionV  
Any additional,  country -specific requirements need to be identified and applied.  
 
7.4. Accountability  
 
The clinical supplies  will be shipped to the coordinating trial site at each country  and 
then, distributed to each site accordingly . 
Trial specific forms to track and register the trial drugs will be used for the 
accountability. Adequate records on the trial medications receipt, use, return, loss, or other 
disposition will be documented and maintained by the trial site. The investigator  or the 
pharmacist or  a designated  person must complete  in real time  all the  documents provided  by 
the sponsor  for the  treatment management . The trial specific forms will be considered as the 
source document . 
Trial monitors will be in charge of checking the drug accountability regularly during 
the monitoring visits.  
The trial drugs  must not be used for any other purpose other than the trial. Under no 
circumstances the investigator or site staff may supply the trial medication to other 
investigators or health care services, or allow the medication to be used other than as directed 
by this protocol without prior authorization from DNDi.  
All patient s must be asked to bring back the trial medication at each visit for 
accountability and treatment compliance verification. The remaining treatments will be later 
collected by the  trial monitor. After checking, the treatments will be packaged in a n inviolable

 primary container  and stored in the research site  or in the coordina tor center  until the 
destruction  is authorized by the sponsor.  
 
7.5. Storage  
 
Stability trials  performed by Eisai showed that E1224 100 -mg capsules were stable at 
30°C/ 75% RH for 12 months and 40°C/75%  RH for 6 months.  Therefore, provisional shelf life 
for E1224 100 -mg capsule s is 24 months at controlled room temperature.  The shelf life of the 
100-mg capsules will be extended based on the results of future stability data.  
BZN tablets  are stable at room temperature (15 ± 30o C). 
Therefore, t he trial drug can be shipped at normal conditions and must be kept at 
room  temperatures , at 30o C. The trial drugs must be kept in a locked room at each of the trial 
sites, with restricted access only by the authorized trial personnel  and/or pharmacist.  
Site storage conditions and temperature must be monitored by the site personnel for 
adherence to product specifications. Records must be done at least once daily and kept in the 
investigator trial file or in the pharmacy file . 
  
7.6. Blinding and procedures for unblinding  
This is a double -blinded trial. Patient s, investigators and sponsor staff directly 
involved with the clinical trial will  not be aware of the treatment allocation and randomization 
list. Double -blinding will be adopted for all trial arms and the placebo arm.   
Primary efficacy analyses will be performed when all patients complete 6 months 
follow -up visit. Analyses of results  will be used to guide planning of a follow -up Phase 3 clinical 
study. Analysis is to be performed by an independent, external statistician. In order to allow 
administrative decisions, the results of the primary endpoint will be disclosed unblinded (by 
treatment arm) to the Joint Development Committee. No individual patient data will be shared 
with the Committee. In addition, data is to be shared with the Data Monitoring Committee.  
The Joint Development Committee is composed of the DNDi Project Leade r (DNDi 
Head of Chagas Program  or designated person ), DNDi Medical Director, and members from 
the Eisai team. On occasion s the JDC meetings are attended by other members of staff from 
these organisations. Under no circumstances will , the Principal Investig ator, trial site staff and 
study personnel from the Sponsor managing the trial have access to the results of the primary 
efficacy analysis prior to the end of the study. They will remain unequivocally blinded until 
completion of 12 months follow -up and fin al database lock. The study statisticians will not have 
acce ss to unbli nded data before conduct of the analyses at the end of the study.  
Protocol number DNDi -CH-E1224 -003    
 May 04, 2018 .  Version  5.0.   
Confidential  Page 49 of 87 
 Randomization pr ocedures will be done via the I RS (Interactive Response System), 
according to a predefined list.  The specific procedures  will be detailed in  the IRS guideline. 
The treatment groups  will be allocated  on Day 1 based on a balanced block  randomization .  
Each patient  will be assigned with an identification code that will correspond to the 
trial kit number allocated to the patient . The label will indicate the trial number and number of 
the kit, but will not indicate the treatment designation.  
All objective measurements in this trial (in terms of efficacy and safety) will be 
performed blinded to the treatment allocation. EKGs will be read centrally and without 
knowledge of the patient¶V treatment group. PCR and laboratory information will be provided 
coded, without the name of the patient to allow blinding during sample processing and analysis.  
Code breaking will be performed via the I RS. The investigator or perso n designated 
must contact the I RS and do the specific procedure as described in the I RS manual.  
Breaking  the code of any  trial patient  should only  be performed  by the investigator  or 
by an authorized person  if absolutely  necessary to find out  the treatment administered . The 
breaking of the  code can only be  performed when the result of a life threatening medical  
emergency  may depend on  the knowledge of the  treatment the  received  by the patient .  The 
DNDi clinical trial manager or the trial monitor must  be immediately informed about the need 
of unblind ing, ideally before doing so.  An emergency code -break form will be filled out with 
information on patient  number, date of code -break, identification and signature of person 
breaking the code, identification of person requesting the code break, reasons for breaking the 
code and investig ator's signature.  
A Serious Adverse Event form should also be filled out  if the reason for code -breaking 
meets th e criteria.  
In addition, t here will be situations whereby unblinding may not necessarily justify  
patient  withdrawal from the trial. In such cases, these patient s should also continue with trial 
visits and assessments as planned . 
 
7.7. Concomitant treatment  
Patient s may receive concomitant therapy for medical occurrences during the course 
of the trial. However, specific drugs that interact with the trial drugs, have the potential to 
shorten the QT interval, elevate liver enzymes, are either sensitive CYP3A4 substrates and/or 
extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 with a narrow therapeutic range, are 
immunos uppressants or are known to have activity against T. cruzi  may not be taken during 
the treatment phase of the trial or up to the 4M visit . These specific drugs are listed in the 
Appendix 2.

Confidential  Page 50 of 87 
 The use of hormonal contraceptives is allowed, however,  the interaction with E1224  
suggests the potential for decrease d efficacy.  The use of any oral, implanted, or injectable 
contraceptive hormones or mechanical products such as an intrauterine device with a 
hormonal component should be registered as concomita nt treatment. Additionally, as 
addressed in section 7.6.8 , women will be required to add an additional method, such as 
barrier.  
All concomitant medications taken by the patient  during the trial, from the date of 
signature of the informed consent until the last follow up visit, will be recorded in the appropriate 
section of the Case Record Form.   
 
8. TRIAL  ASSESSMENTS  
8.1. Timing of Assessments  
As described in Section 5 , Schedule of events, trial assessments will be done at 
Screening (Days ±D -40 to D -1), Day 0 (baseline), Day 1, Day 2, Day 3 (allowable window of 
+ 2 days for day 3 only) , at weekly intervals at week 2 (allowable window of + 3 days) , 3, 4, 6, 
8, 10, and 12 (allowable window of ± 3  days) , and after 4 , 6, and 12  months from treatment 
initiation  (allowable window of ± 7 days) . On the week s 5 and 7, patient s will go directly to the 
pharmacy to return and take their treatments  (E1224 will be administered on site).  
The primary efficacy assessment will be done at EOT,  week 12 and at  4, and 6months 
of follow -up by serial qualitative PCR (3 samples to be collected in the same day ). Secondary 
efficacy assessments will be performed at  weeks  1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 12, and at 4 , and 12  months . 
PK assessments will be done at Day 0 (pre -dose), Day 1 (post 1st dose), Day 2, Day 3, 
week 2, 3, 4, 6 (steady -state phase), and at week 10  (elimination phase ). 
Safety assessments will be d one at Day 1 (post -dose), at D2, D3, W2, W3, W4, W6, W8, 
W10, W12, and at 4, 6 , and 12 months , and at any unscheduled visit.  
 
 
 
 
8.2. Screening and Baseline Assessments  
 
During screening, and after obtaining Informed Consent, the following assessments will be 
done in order to evaluate patient  eligibility for the trial: 
x Complete medical history with an emphasis on CD;  
Protocol number DNDi -CH-E1224 -003    
 May 04, 2018 .  Version  5.0.   
Confidential  Page 51 of 87 
 x Demographic data and history of medications;  
x Physical examination, body weight and height  and vital signs;  
x Chagas Disease serology: serum sample will be collected at screening for conventional  
CD sero logy. Patient  must have at least 2 positive tests (among Conventional ELISA, 
Recombinant ELISA or IIF) to be eligible;  
x Real-time PCR for qualitative and quantitative assessment  (q-PCR ) for all patient s. In 
addition to positive serological tests, the patient  must at least have one positive 
qualitative PCR test to be eligible for this trial; 
x Clinical safety laboratory evaluations :  CBC , ALT, AST, total and direct bilirubin, GGT, 
alkaline phosphatase , creatinine , fasting glucose, Ca, Mg and K will be assessed at 
screening and repeated at Day 0.  
x Morning serum cortisol: a morning blood sample will be taken for cortisol levels at 
screening visit.   
The following parameters must be within the lab ranges defined below:  
 Total WBC must be within the normal range, with an acceptable margin of +/ - 5%  
 Platelets must be within the normal range up to 550,000 / mm3 
 Total bilirubin must be within the normal range  
 Transaminases (ALT and AST) must be within the normal range, with  an 
acceptable margin of 25% above the upper limit of normality (ULN), <1.25 x ULN.  
 Creatinine must be within the normal range, with an acceptable margin of 10% 
above the ULN, <1.10 x ULN.  
 Alkaline phosphatase must be within the normal range up to Grade 1 CTCAE (< 
2.5 x ULN)  
 GGT must be within the normal range up to 2x ULN.  
 Fasting g lucose must be within the normal range  
 Electrolytes (Ca, Mg, K) must be within the normal range  
If blood samplings (h aematology and biochemistry) are out of the ranges defined above, but 
within the limits of CTCAE Grade 1, and the investigator consider this laboratory finding as not 
clinically significant, one new sample can be collected from the patient  and retested. The  retest 
could be done only one time within the screening period.  
Protocol number DNDi -CH-E1224 -003    
 May 04, 2018 .  Version  5.0.   
Confidential  Page 52 of 87 
 If the result of retest is within the margins defined above, the Investigator will review the 
parameter(s) together with all other medical information available (medical history, clinical 
examinations, vital signs, etc.) and upon his/her medical judgement will decide if the patient  is 
eligible or not for trial randomization.  
x Serum pregnancy test: Women of reproductive potential will undergo a serum 
pregnancy test at screening. The test must b e negative for the woman to be considered 
eligible for this trial; 
x EKG: 1 examination will be obtained at screening  and must be normal for patient  
eligibiliW\, i.e. PR 200 mVec ; QRS <120 msec ; and QTc  350 mVec and 450 mVec 
interval durations  in males , and QTc 470  msec in women . Any clinically significant 
abnormalities found on the electrocardiogram will automatically lead to patient  
exclusion from this trial. 
x  Please refer to item 7.5.2  (Sampling Assessment Schedule) for detailed  
information on required  sampling volume.   
At baseline (Day 0) the following assessments will be performed before the first dose of 
medication is administered, in order to obtain baseline safety data and data for further 
comparative analyses and multiple parameter correlations:  
x Physical exam  
x Vital signs: axillary temperature, blood pressure and pulse rate.  
x Serum pregnancy test: Women of childbearing potential will undergo a second serum 
pregnancy test so as to ensure they are not pregnant at treatment onse t. Any positive 
test at baseline will automatically exclude the patient from this clinical trial.  
x Blood sample for non -conventional serology  and laboratory assessments  
x PK sample, pre -dose  
Concomitant medications at baseline will be recorded in the appropri ate CRF.  
Patient¶V eligibility criteria evaluation will be performed at day 0/ day 1  (before dosing) , or 
when the investigator has access to all results necessary for patient¶V inclusion/exclusion 
evaluation. After patient  eligibility is confirmed, randomization will occur and  patient  will receive 
the first dose of medication at the clinic. On day 1, vital signs , EKG ( 1 examination) and PK 
sampling will also be performed after treatment administration. D0 and D1 may be at t he same 
day if all results are available for patient¶V eligibility assessment. In this case,  site should pay 
attention to perform  examinations pre  and post -dose accordingly  (see Schedule of Events  in 
section 5) .

Confidential  Page 53 of 87 
 Patient s will be observed for occurrence of adverse events during the whole trial. If any AE 
occurs, the patient  will receive medical assistance, and the event will be recorded in the 
appropriate CRF.  
8.3. Assessment of Efficacy  
Efficacy of trial treatment will be assessed by comparing the parasitological response , 
determined by serial qualitative PCR (3 negative PCR results to be collected in the same day)  
assessed at EOT and sustain ed parasitological clearance  until 6 months of follow -up. Follow -
up will be continued until 12 months for complementary assessment of response.  
For the assessment of efficacy, the EOT of each treatment arm will be defined accordingly 
to its corresponding duration . For efficacy assessments, the EOT of each treatment arm will 
be defined in accordance to the duration of the treatment regimen. Sustained response will be 
assessed in all treatment arms using the same number of PCR samples (i.e., EOT; 12 weeks; 
4, and 6 months). The primary efficacy outcome is evaluated until 6 months of follow -up. 
As this is a double -blind trial, this will not interfere on the schedule of events, since all 
patients will take all samples planned at each visit.  
In addition, a qualitative, qu antitative, and multi -criteria efficacy assessment of 
Benznidazole and BZN/ E1224 will be performed, correlating incidence of and time to 
parasitological clearance  with changes in  T. cruzi serology and with safety and PK parameters, 
as described in the following sections.  
 
8.3.1.  Assessments performed  
 
A blood samples ( 15mL) will be collected  in the same day at screening , 2 randomly 
times between  Days 1, 2 and 3 (allowable window of + 2 days  for day 3 only ), at weeks 2 
(allowable window of + 3 days) , 3, 4, 6, 10 and 12 (allowable window of ± 3 days), and at 4 , 6, 
and 12 months follow -up (allowable window of ± 7 days) for PCR analysis (qualitative and 
quantitative PCR). Blood samples collected for PCR shall be immediately added to a tube 
containing one volume ( 5mL) of a solution of Guanidine/ClH 6M EDTA 0.2M pH 8,0 Buffer 
(GEB) (Schijman, 2003). Samples with guanidine buffer can remain at room temperature  
without exposure to sunlight or heat .  
PCR samples will be shipped to their respective molecular biology laboratory where 
PCR assays will be performed according to the site country:  
Samples from Bolivia: Universidad Mayor San Simón , Cochabamba.

 The real -time PCR technique that will be used is the one described and optimised  by 
Duffy et al. Results will be expressed qualitatively for the assessment of the primary efficacy 
endpoint and quantitatively for secondary analyses of parasite load.  
In order to guarantee the quality, integrity and standardization of the qPCR procedures 
between the two laboratories, Quality Assurance mechanisms were developed such as:  
Reproducibility evaluation : Blind analysis of 10% of samples from the trial, taken 
randomly and sent to two laboratories of molecular biology quarterly. The results of these 
samples will be re -sent to an independent laboratory in a pre -established time to a DNDi ad -
hoc committee for analysis of concordance compared to the results obtained from the two 
laboratories participating in the trial. 
Qualitative concordance: Detectable or undetectable values of each sample following 
the reporting criteria according to pre -established standardized analysis PCR evaluation 
process. It is expected to ac hieYe  0.75 kaSSa inde[ foU concoUdance of all VamSleV anal\]ed.  
Quantitative concordance:  
The degree of concordance must match the coefficient of variation of the method 
according to the parasitic load. The limit of quantification of the method was estim ated as 1,531 
CL Brener par. eq./mL GEB (equivalent to 1.85 log10 par. eq./10 mL). By definition this limit 
was chosen to present a coefficient of variation of 20% of the results expressed in logarithm, 
as recommended by the document EP17 -A (NCCLS, 2004) f rom the precision calculation of 
the method published in Duffy et al, 2012. Thus, values less than 1.85 log par.eq /10 mL are 
not quantifiable, .values 2 log par/10 mL have a coefficient of variation of 6% and values 4 log 
par/ 10 mL show a coefficient of variation of 1.72%. The parasite load corresponding to the CV 
of each sample can be estimated by Sigma Plot (SPSS, Chicago, IL).  
PCR samples taken at different moments during the treatment period will allow a 
comparative assessment of the time to clearance  of parasitemia for each of the treatment 
regimens versus that of placebo. Sustained p arasitological clearance  will be evaluated at EOT 
until 6 months follow -up visit  as primary endpoint , and until 12 months as secondary endpoint.  
The real -time PCR assays will allow assessment of change in parasite load over time 
and of comparative reduction in parasite load values at week s 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 12, and at 4, 6, 
and 12  months follow -up. It will also allow for correlation between parasi te load at baseline 
with the incidence and time of parasitological response and pharmacokinetic parameters.  
Other measurements will also be performed , as follows:

 - For conventional serology blood sample will be collected at screening  and 12 months after 
treatment initiation. For non-conventional serology, blood sample will be collected at D0, at 
week 1 2 and at 4 , 6 and, 12 months after treatment  initiation . 
- Samples will be collected for future biomarkers assessment.  No further assessments will be 
done prior to local Ethics Committee (s) authorization (s). This information will also be available 
in the informed consent form.  
The trial manual of operations will provide full details regarding procedures for sampling 
(tube s types and amount, aliquots volume), handling, storage, and shipment of the samples 
for laboratory evaluation. Quality assurance systems will be in place and described.  Training 
of personnel in each of the activities described above will take place befor e initiation of this 
clinical trial. All parasitological and other laboratory assessments will be performed blinded to 
treatment allocation.  
 
8.4. PK Assessments  
Blood samples for PK purpose will be taken from either arm. They will be collected either 
by finger-prick, cannulation or by venepuncture of a forearm vein(s).  
For RAV and benznidazole , whole blood samples will be collected into filter paper (dried 
blood spots ± DBS).  
The blood samples will be transported to the Bioanaly tical laboratory.  
Blood samples will be analyzed for BZN and RAV using validated bioanalytical methods 
that will be described in a separate document.  
RAV concentrations will be assessed using a LC/MS/MS  method using dried blood spots . 
The limit of quantification is 20 ng/m L. 
For BZN, a LC/MS/MS method for benznidazole analysis in dried blood spots will be used. 
The limit of quantification is 50 ng/mL.  
Blood  level concentrations over time will be determined during the absorption, steady -state 
and elimination pharmacokinetics  phases.  
The PK parameters to be modelled are AUC, Cmax, Cmin, CL, Vd, and t1/2.

 Overall, a total of 9 blood samples will be collected for PK analyses . 
The time of trial drug administration and blood draws will be recorded in the appropriate 
sections of the CRF.   
Whenever possible, the PK sample will be an aliquot from blood draws collected for other 
reasons , such as safety laboratory assessments.  
The PK data obtained will be correlated with parasitological response (qualitative and 
quantitative), other secondary efficacy data and safety outcomes.  
 
8.5. Assessmen t of Safety  
Safety and tolerability of all treatments will be assessed through routine monitoring of 
adverse events. At each trial visit, the patient s will be enquired about current adverse events 
or any events observed during the period previous to the visit. Evaluation of hematology and 
blood chemistry values, regular measurement of vital signs and physical examinations will be 
made at each scheduled f ollow -up visit, as summarized in section 5.  
Cardiac Safety : 
x EKGs will be performed at selected trial visits (Days 1, 2, 3 and at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 
4 months ) in order to identify possible electrocardiographic abnormalities. If clinically 
significant a bnormalities are judged by the investigators  at these visits, unscheduled EKG 
should  be performed until normalization.  
x Patients will be re -dosed only following on -site physician review of available EKGs (central 
reading). Specific criteria for treatment discontinuation are described in Section 9 of the 
trial protocol.  
x Any patient  with a QTc,  post dosing <310 msec or  with a QTc , post dosing  <350 msec 
accompanied of cardiac symptoms , shall be withdrawn  (Specific criteria for treatment 
discontinuation are described in sections 9.1 and 9.2).  In those cases, a full cardiac 
assessment should be performed, including EKG, Echocardiogram and Holter.   
x Any patient  with a delta QTc >60 msec post dosing  will have the trial medication 
permanently interrupted and will follow the standard trial schedule. For the cases where 
in addition to the delta QTc >60 msec post -dosing, cardiac symptoms are present, an 
EKG should be performed at unscheduled visits.  
Protocol number DNDi -CH-E1224 -003    
 May 04, 2018 .  Version  5.0.   
Confidential  Page 57 of 87 
 x Echo cardiography will be performed in all patient s with any clinically significant change in 
the EKG and in all patient s with AEs determined to be of cardiac etiology.  
x Holter monitoring will be carried out in patient s with cardiac symptoms or EKG with 
evidence  of arrhythmia.  
x Cardiac safety experts will periodically review all EKG s and present information to the 
DMC. Central reading of the EKG s will constitute the EKG  database. In addition, the 
cardiac safety expert will review all Cardiac System Organ Class (S OC) AEs; and all non -
Cardiac SOC that have the potential to be related to Cardiac AEs.  
Liver Safety : 
As part of the liver risk assessment plan, treatment discontinuation should be considered 
if: 
x ALT or AST >8xULN  (to be reported as Adverse Event of Special Interest =AESI ) 
x ALT or AST >5xULN for more than 2 weeks  
x ALT or AST >3xULN and (TBL >2x  ULN or prothrombin time INR >1.5)  (H\ LaZ¶V

Adrenal Safety  
x Confirmed abnormal low morning cortisol test results will be reported as an AESI. More 
details are described in section 8.6.3 . 
Also, patient s will be advised to return to the clinic on any day during the follow -up 
period if they present any medical occurrence, as to allow for AE assessments at any 
unscheduled visits.

 All safety assessments will be performed by a trial team member, who is blinded to the 
treatment allocation.  
AEs will be recorded in the appropriate section of the CRF (see details on Section 8.6.).  
A DMC will review safety information on an ongoing basis (see section 11). 
 
8.5.1.  Laboratory examinations  
Labor atory parameters of hematology and biochemistry will be measured at screening, 
Day 0, weekly during treatment duration (weeks  2, 3, 4 , 6, and 8 ), at weeks 10 and 12 and at 
4, and 6 months  follow up  and at any unscheduled visit if clinically indicated.  
Clinical safety laboratory evaluations include CBC , ALT, AST, total direct and indirect 
bilirubin, GGT, alka line phosphatase, and creatinine , fasting glucose , Ca, Mg and K . 
Prothrombin Time (INR) will be assessed in case of ALT or AST >3xULN . 
In addition ,  a morning blood sample will be taken for serum cortisol levels at  screening, 
weeks 4, 8 and at 12 months.  Normal laboratory parameters are detailed in Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v 4.03) for the laboratory/metabolic category.

using standard medical terminology in order to avoid the use of vague, ambiguous or colloquia l 
expressions. Serious and/or unexpected adverse events will be reported by telephone  or e-
mail to DNDi (see details in Section 8.6.5).  
 
8.6.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
 
An Adverse Event or Reaction which:  
- results in death,  
i.e. causes or contributes to the death.  
- is life -threatening,  
in this context refers to an AE/AR in which the patient was at risk of death at the time 
of the AE/AR; it does not refer to an AE/AR that hypothetically might have caused death 
if more severe.  
Protocol number DNDi -CH-E1224 -003    
 May 04, 2018 .  Version  5.0.   
Confidential  Page 61 of 87 
 - requires in -patient hospitaliz ation or prolongation of existing hospitali zation, 
i.e. the AE requires at least an overnight admission or prolongs a hospitali zation beyond 
the expected length of stay. Hospital admissions for surgery planned before study 
entry, for social reasons, for any elective surgery (i.e. plastic surgery) or for normal 
disease management (including treatment adjustment) are NOT to be considered a s 
SAE according to this criterion (i.e. if the protocol or the standard management of the 
disease under study requires planned hospitali zation). 
- results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity,  
i.e. the AE resulted in a substantial disrupti on of Whe VXbjecW¶V abiliW\ Wo condXcW noUmal 
activities.  
- is a miscarriage , congenital anomaly / birth defect,  
i.e. an adverse event outcome in a child or foetus of a subject exposed to the 
Investigational Medicinal Product (or marketed medicinal product  (Note: to be only 
added for marketed drug)) before conception or during pregnancy.  
- is an important medical event, i.e. is medically significant.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other 
situations should be considere d serious events/reactions, such as important medical 
events that might not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization  
but might jeopardise  the patient or might require intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed abo ve. ³E[amSleV of VXch eYenWV aUe inWenViYe WUeaWmenW in an 
emergency room, or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalization  or development of dependency or

Any suspected transmission via a medicinal p roduct of an infectious agent . 
- Liver function abnormalities reaching any Hy Law criteria  
Liver function abnormalities reaching any Hy Law criteria (ALT or AST > 3 x ULN in 
combination with total bilirubin elevation >2 x ULN or prothrombin time INR > 
1.5) will be considered as serious AEs if there is no evidence of obstructive disease 
and no other reason can be found to explain the combination of aminotransferase and 
total bilirubin elevation. Subjects who experience these liver abnormalities sho uld 
permanently be discontinued from treatment. Liver enzymes should be followed until 
resolution or until return to baseline levels. Other possible causes of similar observed 
injury include viral hepatitis A, B, or C, pre -existing or acute liver disease, or other drugs 
and should be investigated in case of such occurrence.

AESI s are not SAEs per s e (from a regulatory point of view) but the Sponsor shall be 
informed in an expedited manner within same timelines (irrespective of the grade of the AESI) 
as required for SAEs but using the AESI form. Shall they meet any seriousness criteria (8. 6.2) 
they sho uld then comply for associated safety reporting requirements and be reported on the 
SAE form.  
8.6.4.  Eliciting Adverse Event information  
The investigator is required to report all directly observed adverse events and all 
adverse events spontaneously reported by t he trial patient  using concise medical terminology. 
In addition, during each trial visit patient  will be interviewed with the use of a checklist and 
undergo a physical exam for adverse event evaluation.  
8.6.5.  Adverse Event reporting period  
The adverse events rep orting period for this trial begins  
x Upon administration of the first dose of trial medication at Day 1 for non -serious 
events;  
Protocol number DNDi -CH-E1224 -003    
 May 04, 2018 .  Version  5.0.   
Confidential  Page 63 of 87 
 x Upon patient  enrolment in the trial (after signature of informed consent) for 
serious events  
and ends at the end of patient par ticipation in the trial.  
All adverse events that occur during the adverse event reporting period specified in the 
protocol must be reported in the CRF, whether or not the event is considered treatment related.  
In addition, any serious  adverse event that occurs subsequent to the adverse event 
reporting period that the investigator assesses as related  to the investigational medication 
should also be reported as an adverse event.  
8.6.6.  Adverse Event reporting requirements  
Information on adverse events must be evaluated by a physician. Each adverse event 
is to be classified by the investigator as serious or non -serious. This classification will 
determine the reporting procedure for the event.  
All serious adverse events (SAE) are to be reported imm ediately (within 24 hours of 
awareness of the SAE by the investigator) to an email to be informed at Study Manual in copy 
to the DNDi clinical trial manager, using the SAE report form.  This includes a description of 
the event, onset date and type, duratio n, severity, relationship to trial drug, outcome, measures 
taken and all other relevant clinical and laboratory data. The initial report is to be followed by 
submission of additional information (follow -up SAE form) as it becomes available. Any follow -
up reports should be submitted as soon as possible and if possible within 5 working days.  
Serious adverse events should also be reported on the clinical trial adverse event case 
report form (CRF). It should be noted that the form for reporting of SAE (SAE for m) is not the 
same as the adverse event section of the CRF. Whereas the same data are collected, the two 
forms must be completed in a consistent manner, and the same medical terminology should 
be used.  Any other additional reporting requirement will be add ressed in the trial manual.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest shall be informed to the Sponsor in an expedited 
manner within same timelines (irrespective of the grade of the AES) as required for SAEs, but 
using the AESI form. If AESI meet any seriousness criteria (8.6.2), they should then comply 
for associated safety reporting requirements and be reported on the SAE form.  
Non-serious adverse events are to be reported in the CRF . In the CRF, a given adverse 
event will be recorded only one time per patient , and the severity recorded will be the maximum 
level reached. If several distinct episodes of the same condition occur, their number will be 
recorded in the CRF.  
Protocol number DNDi -CH-E1224 -003    
 May 04, 2018 .  Version  5.0.   
Confidential  Page 64 of 87 
 In addition to immediately reporting SAEs to DNDi, Investigators are responsible for 
reporting SAEs occurring at their site to their Independent Ethics Committee (IEC), and any 
periodic safety reporting, following the local re quirements of their institution .  
 
8.6.7.  Grading of Adverse Event severity  
Severity is a clinical determination of the intensity of an AE. The severity for an AE 
VhoXld be gUaded XVing Whe NaWional CanceU InVWiWXWe¶V Common TeUminolog\ CUiWeUia foU 
Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 4.03). In case of AEs that are not described in the  CTCAE v 
4.03, the investigator will use the terminology MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the 
maximum severity of the adverse event as follows:  
MILD    Does not interfere with patient 's usual functions  
MODERATE   Interferes to some extent with patient 's usual functions  
SEVERE   Interferes significantly with patient 's usual functions  
This information on AE grading will be entered in the adverse event section of the CRF.  
 It is to be noted the distinction between severity and seriousness of adverse events . A 
severe adverse event is not necessarily a serious event.  
8.6.8.  Adverse Event causality assessment  
For both serious and non -serious adverse events, the investigator is required to assess 
the potential relationship between the adverse event and the trial drug,  i.e. to determine 
whether there exists a reasonable possibility  that the trial drug caused or contributed to the 
adverse event.  
To help investigators with the decision binary tree in the evaluation of causality, the 
CIOMS VI group recommends that investi gators be asked to consider the following before 
reaching a decision:  
x Medical history  
x Lack of efficacy/worsening of existing condition  
x Trial medications  
x Other medications (concomitant or previous)  
x Withdrawal of trial medication, especially following trial discontinuation/end of 
trial medication  
x Erroneous treatment with trial medication (or concomitant)  
x Protocol related procedure  
Protocol number DNDi -CH-E1224 -003    
 May 04, 2018 .  Version  5.0.   
Confidential  Page 65 of 87 
 The relationship of an AE to investigational treatment is assessed and determined by 
the i nvestigator after careful consideration of the event in terms of biological plausibility, 
possible unrelated causes, any pre -existing medical conditions or concomitant medications, 
temporal relationship between administration of investigational treatment a nd the onset (or 
worsening) of the event, and known patterns of response to trial medications  in general.  
The causality assessment of an AE to the investigational medicinal product will be rated 
as follows:  
x Not related:  There is no reasonable possibility of causal relationship.   
x Related:  There is at least a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between 
an adverse event and an investigational medicinal product. This means that there 
are facts (evidence) or argu ments to suggest a causal relationship.   
The decision to suspend, and resume treatment or to permanently interrupt treatment 
due to an adverse event will be left to the trial clinician in charge .The clinician should take in 
consideration the Assessment of  Safety defined for this protocol ( section 8.5 ) and the  Rules 
for permanently interrupting trial treatment  ( section 9.2 ). 
8.6.9.  Exposure in utero  
In this trial, women of reproductive age must have a negative serum pregnancy test at 
screening, must not be breas tfeeding, and must use a double barrier method of contraception 
to avoid exposure to the study drugs during  pregnancy throughout the clinical trial and up for 
3 months after completion of the trial, in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized 
especially during exposure to treatment  and until complete elimination .  Women who are using 
oral, implanted, or injectable contraceptive hormones or mech anical products such as an 
intrauterine device with a hormonal component are required to use an additional barrier 
method of contraception for the time period specified.  
In addition to the serum pregnancy tests performed at screening and Day 0, an 
additio nal pregnancy test will be carried out at week 10, and at 6 and 12 months follow -up visit.  
If any trial subject becomes or is found to be pregnant  while receiving any of the study 
treatment drugs (or during study post -treatment follow -up period + 3 months ), the medication 
must be interrupted and inYeVWigaWoU mXVW VXbmiW Whe eYenW on a µ Clinical Study Pregnancy 
Report Form ¶ together with the first day of last menstruation period and the expected date of 
birth. This must be done irrespective of whether an adverse event has occurred. The 
information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery.  
 
Protocol number DNDi -CH-E1224 -003    
 May 04, 2018 .  Version  5.0.   
Confidential  Page 66 of 87 
 The investigator will follow the patient  until completion of the pregnancy or until 
pregnancy termination (i.e., induced/spontaneous abortion). The investigator will provide 
SUegnanc\ oXWcome infoUmaWion in a µ Clinical Study  Pregnancy Outcome Report Form ¶.  
Note:  A pregnancy is not an SAE . Any unfavorable outcome meeting a seriousness criterion, 
i.e., in the case of unfavorable pregnancy outcome (miscarriage, stillbirth), birth defect occurs 
or congenital abnormality shall be reported using the SAE form (in addition to the Pregnancy 
Outcome  Form). 
 
In the case of a live birth, a pediatrician should assess the infant at the time of birth and submit 
a Child Surveillance form . Newborns of study subjects exposed to study drug s during 
pregnancy will be followed up until the age of 2 years.   
 
Because of the risk of development of lenticular opacity , (cataract) found in animal studies with 
E1224 , an ophthalmologist will also assess the infant of study subjects exposed to study drugs 
during pregnancy  from the time of birth until the child reaches  24 months of age. The principal 
investigator must gather information on the child's health status from birth to 24 months of age 
by the child's treating physicians (pediatrician, ophthalmologist). Investigator must inform and 
advise the mother to ensure t he monitoring of the child's health status, as well as complete the 
safety information of the child's health status in the corresponding form ( Child Surveillance 
Form ). 
 
  
8.6.10.  Adverse event follow -up 
All adverse events should be followed until they are resolved or the investigator 
assesses them as chronic or stable or the patient  participation in the trial ends (i.e., until a final 
report is completed for that patient ).  
In addition, all serious advers e events and those non -serious events assessed by the 
investigator as possibly related to the investigational drug must continue to be followed even 
after the patient  participation in the trial is over. Such events should be followed until they 
resolve or XnWil Whe inYeVWigaWoU aVVeVVeV Whem aV ³chUonic´ oU ³VWable.´  
9. WITHDRAWAL CRITERIA  
A patient  should be withdrawn from the trial treatment if, in the opinion of the investigator, 
it is medically necessary, or if it is the wish of the patient .  
If a patient  does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact 
the patient .  
In any circumstance, every effort should be made to document patient  outcome, if

 possible.  
If the patient  withdraws consent, no further evaluations should be performed and no 
attempts should be made to collect additional data, with the exception of safety data, which 
should be collected if possible and in accordance with patient  consent.  
If a patient  withdraw s from the trial, the reason must be noted on the CRF.  
If a patient  is withdrawn from the trial because of a treatment limiting adverse event, 
thorough efforts should be made to clearly document the outcome of AE.  
9.1. Rules in case of treatment suspension or temporarily interruption  
Treatment discontinuation does not imply withdrawal from the trial. In such cases, the 
treatment might be discontinued for a few days; therefore , the treatment will be considered 
incomp lete or delayed. Treatment  can be resumed, according to the assessment of the trial 
investigator in charge of the patient . Please check the instructions for safety assessment and 
follow -up as per section 8.5.  These patient s should  continue with trial visits and assessments 
as planned, but the reasons for treatment discontinuation must be recorded in the appropriate 
source documentation and CRF.  
9.2. Rules for permanently interrupting trial treatment  
The Investigator will interrupt permanently the  treatment based on the following:  
x ALT or AST >8x  ULN (to be reported as Adverse Event of Special Interest  (AESI) ) 
x ALT or AST >5x  ULN for more than 2 weeks  
x ALT or AST >3x  ULN and (TBL >2x  ULN or INR >1.5 ; H\ laZ¶V cUiWeUia; Wo be UeSoUWed 
as a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
x ALT or AST >3x  ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%)  
x QTc post dosing <310  msec or <350 msec accompanied of cardiac symptoms  
x QTc> 500 msec a t any time during treatment  
x QTc post dosing >60msec

patient  at undue risk by continuing the trial treatment  
x Major protocol deviation incompatible with the continuation /participation  on the trial 
x Any condition that the investigators considers medically necessary to interrupt the 
treatment, such as:  
o Significant leukopenia (<2,500 cel ls/mm3)  
o Severe gastrointestinal symptoms  
o Severe allergic dermopathy

 o Peripheral sensitive n europathy   
x Pregnancy  
Regardless  of the reasons for trial treatment interruption, the investigator  will make all 
necessary arrangements to ensure that the patient  receives the appropriate treatment for the 
relevant medical condition.  
Rescue treatment will be offered for these patient s upon trial completion .  
9.3. Patient  withdrawal from the trial  
The following will be considered reasons to indicate patient  withdrawal from the trial:  
x Withdrawal of consent by the patient/legal representative  
x Trial termination by the Sponsor  
x Any condition that the investigators considers medically necessary to withdraw patient 
from the trial 
If the patient  withdraws the consent, no further evaluations should be performed and no 
attempts should be made to collect additional data, with the exception of safety data, which 
should be collected if possible.  
All patient s withdrawn will be clinically evaluated by the investigator and if appropriate 
treated with rescue medication . Patient  care will continue according to national treatment 
guidelines.  
If a patient  withdraws from the trial, the reason must be noted in the CRF. Data obtained 
prior to the withdrawal of a p atient will still be included in the PK, efficacy , and safety analyses.  
 
9.4. Lost to follow -up  
If a patient  does not return for a scheduled visit, all necessary measures should be 
taken to contact the patient  and document the patient¶V outcome , and before declaring him 
³loVW Wo folloZ -XS´, Whe inYeVWigaWoU mXVW enVXUe eYeU\ effoUW Wo conWacW him/heU  and to establish 
the reason for the discontinuation of treatment . All contact attempts should be documented 
accordingly.  
In order to minimise loss to fol low-up detailed contact information including address 
and mobile phone number for the patient  and /or a relative will be taken as part of the screening 
assessments. This information will remain at the site. If the patient  does not self -present to the 
site and a phone number is not available then the field team will follow -up with the patient or 
their family directly.  A patient  will only be considered lost to follow -up after the  12 month follow -
up visit.

 Patient s withdrawn from this trial will not be replaced.  
10. DATA ANALYSIS AND STATISTICAL METHODS  
The Statistical Analysis  Plan will be  written  after the protocol  finalization and  definitely  
finalized before  breaking  the blind  mode, prior to the first database lock . These specifications  
will detail  the implementation of  all statistical analyzes  planned according to  the main features  
reported  in the protocol.  
10.1.  Sample size determination  
A total of 210 patient s will be recruited in the trial.  
For a comparison of two independent binomial proportions using Pearson's Chi -
square statistic with a Chi -square approximation with a two -sided significance level of 0.006 
(multiplicity adjustment of 0.05 for 6 comparisons [treated arms] against the control  arm), a 
sample size of 11 patient s per arm assuming a balanced design achieves a power of at least 
0.8 when the proportions are 0.082 (control arm) and 0.81 (treatment arm).  
With an estimated proportion of 10% patient s who might drop-out from the trial, the 
final sample size needed is 1 2 patient s per arm for one comparison.  
A sample size of 30 patient s per arm will allow a 99% probability of observing at least 
one event of peripheral neuropathy or paresthesia, transaminase increase, hypersensitivity 
(13.3%, 15.5%, and 22.2 %, respectively) and a n 85% probability of observing at least one 
treatment discontinuation per arm.  
10.2.  Definition of trial populations included in the analysis  
The primary efficacy analyses will be performed on the Intention -to-treat (ITT) data 
set, defined as all randomized patient s by their assigned treatment arms.  
Additionally, efficacy analyses will be performed on a per -protocol (PP) dataset. The 
per-protocol dataset will be defined as patient s receiving randomized treatment, who meets 
entry criteria, have not permanently discontinued treatment administration and had no major 
protocol deviation. Eligibility and evaluability criteria will be further detailed in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan.  
All safety analyses will be performed on the All Treated Set, defined as all patients 
who received at least one dose of the treatment.  
Based  on actual  deviations , the criteria for any patient  exclusion from  the different 
data sets  will be specified  and updated  as necessary  prior to the  break of the blind.

 At the end of the trial the following will be described:  
x Number of patient s screened;  
x Number of patient s assessed for eligibility excluded from the trial and reasons for 
exclusion;  
x Number of patient s who have been enrolled in the trial (ITT set);  
x Number of patient s randomized into each trial arm;

EOT assessments (treatment completers), per trial arm; 
x Number (%) of patient s who have completed the trial per trial arm ( trial completers , PP 
set); 
x Number (%) of patient s who completed the trial visits at Days 0,  1, 2, 3, weeks 2, 3, 4, 
5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 4, 6, and 12 months follow -up visits, total and per trial arm; 
x Number (%) of patient s lost to follow -up and reasons of lost, total and per trial arm; 
x Number (%) of patients who have withdrawn from the trial, per trial arm and reasons 
for withdrawal.  
x Number (%) of patient s excluded from analysis per trial arm and reasons for exclusion;  
x Number (%) of patient s with at least one protocol violation and nature of protocol 
violation (major, minor)  
10.3.  Baseline  
 
 The following baseline characteristics of the trial population will be described  
generally and per centre/country.  
x Age distribution  
x Gender distribution  
x Weight  
x BMI 
x Nationality and country(ies) of residence;  
x Parasite load measured through real -time quantitative PCR;

10.4.  Treatment Compliance  
Protocol number DNDi -CH-E1224 -003    
 May 04, 2018 .  Version  5.0.   
Confidential  Page 71 of 87 
 This is a double blind trial and compliance will be considered according to treatment 
course . During the trial, the treatment compliance will be monitored through weekly follow -up 
visits, as summarized in section 5 , and all information registered in the appropriate section of 
the CRF.  
At the weekly visits, E1224 or E1224 ±match ing placebos will be administered under 
the supervision of trial staff. The patient  will receive enough BZN or BZN match ing placebos 
until the next scheduled visit.  Also, they must bring all remaining trial drugs to check for 
compliance with prescribed treatment and ensure drug accountability.  
Treatment compliance will be described in the trial report, describing the number and 
percentage of patients who completed and who did not complete a full course of treatment per 
trial arm, and the reasons for treatment drop -out per trial arm. 
For patient s who do not complete a full treatment course, mean time of exposure to 
trial drug will be described per  trial arm. 
 
10.5.  Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint is parasitological response , defined as sustained 
parasitological clearance until6 months  of follow -up. It is determined by serial qualitative PCR 
results (3 negative PCR results to be collected in the same day) . 
Hypothesis:  Benznidazole or Benznidazole/E1124 improved regimens  treatment 
leads to a statistically significant better sustained parasitological clearance rate at 6 months of 
follow -up than placebo in patient s with chronic indeterminate CD. 
The primary analysis will be the comparison of the  sustained  parasitological clearance 
of each treatment arm versus that of the placebo arm . Six main final comparisons will be 
performed. Hochberg procedure will be used to keep the global type I error a t the 5% level and 
cope with the multiplicity issue.  With sustained clearance of parasitemia as the parameter of 
interest , a comparison with placebo will be carried out.  An alpha adjustment to 0. 025 is 
considered for the interim analyses to account for potential Type I inflation.  
Primary efficacy analyses will be performed when all patients complete 6 months 
follow -up visit. Analyses of results will be used to guide planning of a follow -up Phase 3 cl inical 
study. Analysis is to be performed by an independent, external statistician. In order to allow 
administrative decisions, the results of the primary endpoint will be disclosed unblinded (by 
treatment arm) to the Joint Development Committee. No indivi dual patient data will be shared 
with the Committee. In addition, data is to be shared with the Data  Monitoring Committee.  
Protocol number DNDi -CH-E1224 -003    
 May 04, 2018 .  Version  5.0.   
Confidential  Page 72 of 87 
 The Joint Development Committee is composed of the DNDi Project Leader (DNDi 
Head of Chagas Program), DNDi Medical Director, and members from Eisai team. On occasion 
the JDC meetings are attended by other members of staff from these organisations  (such as, 
DNDi Research and Development Director and He ad of Chemistry, Manufa cturing and 
Controls) . Under no circumstances will the Principal Investigator, trial site staff and study 
personnel from the Sponsor managing day -to-day activities of the trial have access to the 
results of the primary efficacy analy sis prior to the end of the study. They will remain 
unequivocally blinded until completion of 12 months follow -up and final database lock. The 
study statisticians will not have access to unblinded data before conduction of the analyses at 
the end of the st udy. Study database will be cleaned and locked in preparation of analyses of 
primary efficacy endpoint. As data accrues following 6 months assessment, it is to be included 
to constitute the final study database for clinical trial data analyses . Other secon dary efficacy 
analyses will further characterize differences in therapeutic response within this trial. For all 
secondary comparisons of proportions between active arms  versus placebo, an exact test will 
be performed.  
For efficacy assessments, the EOT of each treatment arm will be defined according 
to the duration of the arm dosing regimen.  
The current primary efficacy endpoint includes the actual EOT time -point for each of 
the different treatment groups, thus the susta ined parasitological response is to be assessed 
in a standardised way across the different arms independent of treatment duration, i.e:

 Latent class analyses will be used to evaluate the association between the 
parasitological clearance  and serological response.   
Multivariate analysis will be performed to define early and late predictors of a 
sustained parasitological response.  
Detailed analysis plan per question of interest will be provided in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP). Information on interim analysis is provided in section 9.8 and also further 
detailed in the SAP.  
 
10.6.  Safety Analysis  
Safety analyses will include all patient s who have received at least one dose of the 
trial medication.  
The proportion of patient s with SAE and/or AEs leading to treatment discontinuation 
will be described per trial arm and by System Organ Class (using pref erred terms defined by 
MedDRA 13.1), accoUding Wo Whe NaWional CanceU InVWiWXWe¶V Common TeUminolog\ CUiWeUia foU 
Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 4.03).  
The proportion of patient s presenting at least one AE will be described. Patient s with 
multiple events with the same preferred terms will be counted once. The maximum severity 
grade for each preferred term and body system will be summarized. If multiple events with the 
same preferred terms are recorded for a patient , the event with the maximum grade will be  
included in the analysis. In addition, a narrative for each of the SAEs and AESIs  will be 
developed detailing all aspects related to the medical event.  
AEs not leading to treatment discontinuation will also be described per trial arm using 
the same classi fication as presented above.  
Incidence rate and 95% confidence interval will be presented per trial arm will be 
presented for SAE , AESI,  and AEs per category and most frequent AEs. Otherwise only 
descriptive statistics will be presented.  
Safety laboratory parameters (h aematology and biochemistry) will also be described 
individually per trial arm, showing the proportion of patient s by degree of elevation relative to 
ULN and to baseline values, and blood levels changes over time. Shift tables will be presente d. 
A listing of patient s experiencing lab parameters elevation will be included.  
EKG  abnormalities will be described per treatment arm as the proportion of patient s 
per type of EKG  finding and changes over time. The cardiac safety data will be compared 
between the different treatment groups and placebo.  
Protocol number DNDi -CH-E1224 -003

Confidential  Page 74 of 87 
 Safety data will be correlated to efficacy and treatment compliance data and to PK 
parameters.   
 
10.7.  Analysis of other endpoints  
Descriptive statistics (i.e. mean, median, SD, variation coefficient, etc) will be used to 
describe the analyzed variables.  
The PK parameters assessed in the population will be AUC, Cmax, Cmin, CL, Vd, 
and t1/2.  
Population pharmacokinetics modelling will be performed using non -linear mixed -
effects modelling as implemented in the software NONMEM® VI (NONMEM Users Guides, 
(1989 -2006) (Beal, S.L., Sheiner L.B., Boeckmann, A.J. (Eds.) Icon Development Solutions, 
Ellicott City, Maryland, USA). This program uses mixed (fixed and random)  effects non -linear 
regression to estimate population parameter means with inter -individual and intra -individual 
(i.e., residual) variability.  
To determine the basic structural pharmacoki netic parameters, a stepwise procedure 
will be used to find the model that best fits Benznidazole/ E1224  data in blood . 
The influence of covariates such as age, body mass index and parasite load at 
baseline will be assessed by graphical visual inspection o f the individual estimates of the 
pharmacokinetics parameters vs. the covariate plots. Potentially or known influential covariates 
will be incorporated sequentially into the pharmacokinetics model. The typical value of a given 
parameter (e.g., CL) will be modelled as linearly dependent on each covariate (e.g. body 
weight, age, etc). Categorical covariates will be coded as indicator variable 0/1.  
Inter-individual variations in PK parameters will be described using an exponential 
error model with normally di stributed inter -individual random variability with mean zero and 
YaUiance Ȧ2. An e[SonenWial eUUoU model Zill be XVed Wo deVcUibe Whe inWUa -patient (residual) 
variability.  
Parameter estimation and model selection: The data will be fitted using the first -order 
conditional method (FOCE INTER in NONMEM). Model selection will be based on the 
likelihood ratio test, pharmacokinetics parameters point estimates, and their respective 
confidence intervals, goodness -of-fit plots , and visual predictive checks (VPC). A  model will be 
considered as a statistically significant improvement over a previous model if it produces a 
decrease in objective function of >10.8 for one additional parameter (Chi -Square; P <0.001).  
Diagnostic plots will be done in R (R Development Core Team 2009. R: A language 
and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,

The PK parameters (AUC and Cmax) will b e correlated with parasitological response 
(sustained parasitological response and fractional reduction of parasitemia), and safety 
outcomes at Day 1 (post dose) , 2, 3 , and weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, 9 , and 10 . 
 
10.8.  Interim analysis  
Two interim analyses and a primary outcome analysis will be performed.  
One Interim analys is for futility , will be performed when 30% of the patient s complete 
12 weeks from treatment initiation  and another, for safety, upon completion of treatment of 
20% of recruited patients.  The primary outcome analysis will occur when all patients have 
completed the 6 -month follow -up visit.  
The interim analyses results will not be disclosed, under any condit ion, to Sponsor 
personnel, the Principal  Investigators and trial personnel at the trial site managing day -to-day 
activities of the trial prior to the end of the trial. They will remain  unequivocally blinded until 
completion of 12 months of follow -up and final database lock. As discussed in section 10.5, 
the Joint Development Committee (including key sponsor management staff not linked with 
clinical trial operations)  and Data Monitoring Committee will have access to primary outcome 
(efficacy and safety ) results by treatment arm at the time of completion of 6 months follow -up 
in order to guide planning of a follow -up Phase 3 clinical study. Sponsor personnel  directly 
involved in the trial , principal investigators and study team site personnel will remain blinded 
to treatment allocation and results of the analyses.  The trial statisticians will not have access 
to unblinded data before conduct of analysis at the end of the trial. Interim a nalys es will be 
performed by an independent statistician . A futility stopping rule is defined as no difference 
from placebo  in sustained parasitemia clearance at 12 weeks . The stopping rule will be applied 
with no change planned on the sample size  of the different study arms . Patient s will be 
considered as early treatment failures . 
The interim analysis results/outcome will not interfere on the trial procedures,  unless 
they meet the criteria defined for the harm and futility  stopping rule. If the stopping rules are 
not applied,  all patient s will be required to complete the 12 months visits follow -up as planned 
by this protocol. In order to account to Type I error inflation, an alpha adjustment is considered 
to 0.025. A total sample size of 1 1 patient s per arm assuming a balanced design achieves a 
power of at least 0.8 when the proportions are 0.082 and 0.81. With a proportion of 10% 
patient s who would drop -out the trial, the final total sample size needed is 1 2 patient s per arm.  
No other changes in t he final analysis defined by this protocol and Statistical Analysis 
Plan will be necessary .

 10.9.  Missing, unused, and spurious data  
The adequate procedure to handle with missing, unused, and spurious data  will be 
described in detail  in the statistical analysis plan, prior to the code break.  
 
10.10.  Deviations from the original statistical plan  
In case of any deviation from the original statistical plan , a justification and description will 
be detailed in a protocol amendment and/or in the final report, as appropriate.  
11. DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE  
A DMC, composed of a minimum of three  members independent of the investigator and 
sponsors, will be set up prior to trial initiation. The DMC will monitor the trial in order to ensure 
that harm is minimized and benefits maximized for the trial patient s. The  DMC will review 
efficacy and safety data on an ongoing basis and at pre -determined intervals, review all 
information related to the occurrence of SAEs , AESIs  and AEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation, and issue recommendations about the trial if the existing benefit/risk of the 
patients in the trial seems compromised. The data and intervals will be agreed prior to or soon 
after the trial initiation and document ed in the DMC Charter. It is to be noted that data on liver 
and cardiac safety will be presented to the DMC for review.  The DMC members will include a 
liver specialist, a  cardiac safety specialist and a member with CD expertise . 
12. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALI TY CONTROL PROCEDURES  
12.1.  IQYHVWLJaWRU¶V ILOH  
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct 
of the trial to be fully documented and the trial data to be subsequently verified. These

forms and other appropriate documents/correspondence.  
12.2.  Case report forms (CRFs)  
Data will be collected by laboratory techn icians, medical doctors, clinical officers and 
nurses authorized by the investigator. It will be supervised by the Investigator and signed by 
the investigator or by an authorized staff member. Trial-specific information will be entered into 
an electronic C ase Report Form (CRF).  Data that are derived should be consistent with the 
source documents or the discrepancies should be explained.  All CRF data should be 
anonymized, ie , identified by trial patient  number only.  
The investigator should ensure the accur acy, completeness, legibility, and timely

 completion of all data reported to the sponsor in the CRFs and any other additional information 
that is required. The investigator is responsible for keeping all consent forms, screening forms, 
CRF and the complete d patient  identification code list in a secure location.  
12.3.  Source documents  
The verification of the CRF data must be by direct inspection of source documents. 
Source documents include patient  hospital/clinic records, physician's and nurse's notes, 
appointmen t book, original laboratory reports, EKG , special assessment reports, signed 
informed consent forms, consultant letters, and patient  screening and enrolment logs.  
The investigator must maintain source documents (such as laboratory and 
consultation reports,  history and physical examination reports), for possible review and/or audit 
by DNDi and/or Regulatory Authorities. The Investigator / designee will record the date of each 
patient¶V YiViW WogeWheU ZiWh a VXmmaU\ of WheiU VWaWXV and SUogUeVV in Whe trial. 
12.4.  Record Retention  
The investigator must keep all essential documents until at least 2 years after the last 
approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or 
contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at leas t 15 years have elapsed since 
the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product.  Trial 
documents should be retained for a longer period however, if required by the applicable 
regulatory requirements or by an agreement with DNDi.  It is the responsibility of the sponsor 
to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. 
After that , these documents may be destroyed with prior permission from DNDi, patient  to local 
regulations.  
Shou ld the investigator wish to assign the trial records to another party or move them 
to another location, DNDi must be notified in advance.  
12.5.  Monitoring  
Clinical Monitors will conduct regular monitoring visits  following the monitoring plan , 
during which he/she will review and source data verify the Informed Consent Forms, medical 
records, laboratory results, imaging assessments, Case Report Forms, drug dispensing logs, 
and protocol violations.  
The investigators will permit representatives o f DNDi and/or designated clinical 
monitors to verify all CRFs, medical records, laboratory work sheets and to assess the status 
of drug storage, dispensing and retrieval at any time  during the trial. Direct access to t he 
corresponding source documents for each patient  will be made granted provided that patient  
confidentiality is maintained in accord with local regulations. The review is for the purpose of 
verifying the adherence to the protocol and to ensure the trial is conducted according to GCP.

 It is im portant that the investigators and other trial site staff are available during these visits.  
The monitoring visits provide DNDi with the opportunity to evaluate the progress of 
the trial, verify the accuracy and completeness of CRFs, resolve any inconsistencies in the trial 
records, as well as to ensure that all protocol requirements, applicable regulations, and 
investigator's obligations are being fulfilled. Four visit types are planned:  pre-trial, trial start, 
during the trial, and trial end. Visits may also be performed by regulatory authorities.

are resolved.  
12.6.  Audits and  Inspections  
The trial site may also be patient  to quality assurance audits by DNDi or designated 
representatives and/or to inspection by regulatory authorities or Independent Ethics 
Committees (IEC).  
The investigators will permit representatives of DNDi a nd/or designated clinical 
auditors to inspect all CRFs, medical records, laboratory work sheets and to assess the status 
of drug storage, dispensing and retrieval at any time during the trial. The corresponding source 
documents for each patient will be mad e available provided that patient confidentiality is 
maintained in accord with local regulations.  
It is important that the investigators and their relevant personnel are available for 
possible audits or inspections.  
12.7.  Data Management  
A CRF must be completed for all patient s that have given informed consent. The 
current clinical trial will use a validated electronic CRF. The trial data will be stored in a 
computer database maintaining confidentiality in accordance with national data leg islation.  
All entries into the CRF are the responsibility of the investigator or a qualified 
designated staff member. The investigator will attest in writing at the beginning of the trial that 
his/her electronic signature is the legally binding equivalent  of a written signature.  
Data will be continuously reviewed by the clinical monitor. Data queries will be 
generated, documented and resolved on an ongoing basis during the trial.   
Six-month efficacy and safety database will be locked when all patients co mplete 6 
months follow -up assessment (after all data queries generated , documented and resolved, as 
appropriate). Twelve -month efficacy and safety database will be locked upon completion of all 
Protocol number DNDi -CH-E1224 -003

Confidential  Page 79 of 87 
 12 months study visits, then constituting the final clinical t rial database for final analyses.  
12.8.  Confidentiality of Trial Documents and Patient s Records  
The investigator must assure that patientV¶ anon\miW\ Zill be mainWained and WhaW WheiU 
identities are protected from unauthorized parties. On CRFs or other documents submitted to 
the sponsor, patient s should not be identified by their names, but exclusively by an 
identification code. The investi gator should keep a patient  enrolment list showing codes, 
names, and addresses. The investigator should maintain documents for submission to sponsor 
authorized representative, and patient¶V Vigned ZUiWWen conVenW foUmV, in VWUicW confidence.  
13. PROTOCOL AMEN DMENTS  
The Principal investigator will ensure that the trial protocol is strictly adhered to 
throughout, and that all data are collected and recorded correctly on the CRF.  
All protocol modifications must be documented in writing. Any protocol amendment 
must be approved and signed by the sponsor and the Principal investigator and is to be 
submitted to the appropriate IEC for information and approval in accordance with local 
requirements, and to regulatory agencies if required. Approval by IEC (and Regulatory 
Authority, if applicable) must be received before any changes can be implemented, except for 
changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to trial patient s, or when the change 
involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the trial (e.g. change in clinical monitor (s), 
change of telephone number (s)). 
The protocol amendment can be initiated by either sponsor or by any Principal 
investigator.  
The investigator wi ll provide in writing the reasons for the proposed amendment and 
will discuss with the clinical trial manager and sponsor.  
14. EARLY TERMINATION OF THE TRIAL 
Both the sponsor and the investigator reserve the right to terminate the trial at any 
time prior to i nclusion of the intended number of patient s, but they intend to exercise this right 
only for valid scientific or administrative reasons. Should this be necessary, both parties will 
arrange the procedures on an individual trial basis after review and consul tation. In terminating 
the trial, the sponsor and the investigator will assure that adequate consideration is given to 
the protection of the patient¶V inWeUeVW.  
Reasons for early termination by the sponsor(s) may include but not be limited to:  
x Low enro llment rate 
x High frequency of protocol violations  
x Inaccurate or incomplete data  
Protocol number DNDi -CH-E1224 -003    
 May 04, 2018 .  Version  5.0.   
Confidential  Page 80 of 87 
 x Unsafe or unethical practices  
x Following the recommendation of the DMC or IEC  
x Administrative decision  
Reasons for early termination by the investigator may be:  
x Insufficient time or resource to conduct the trial 
x Lack of eligible patient s 
Stopping rules will be clearly defined for both futility and  safety.  
x For safety, a harm stopping rule will be defined on safety criteria and 
depending on the DMC judgment, as defined in the DMC  charter. The DMC will review 
AEs and Lab data to decide whether the arm should be stopped or not  
x Regarding efficacy, with sustained clearance of parasitemia at 12 
weeks as the parameter of interest, a comparison with placebo will be 
undertaken .Alpha -adjust ment to 0.0 25 is considered to account for the 
type I error inflat ion. 
In the event that a trial is terminated either by the sponsor or by the investigator, the 
investigator has to:  
x Complete all CRFs to the greater extent possible  
x Return all test articles, CRF, and related trial materials to the sponsor 
who provided them  
x Answer all questions of the sponsors or their representatives related to 
data of patient s enrolled at the site prior to trial termination  
x Ensure that patient s enrol led in the trial who had not yet reached a 
follow up time point are followed up with the necessary medical care  
x Provide in writing the reasons for his /her decision to the regulatory 
bodies and the sponsor  
 
15. ETHICS  
The protocol for this trial has been design ed in accordance with the general ethical 
principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and ICH guidelines for Good Clinical Practice 
(ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline - Guideline for Good Clinical Practice E6  (R1) - current 
step 4 version dated 10 June 1996)). DNDi assures that it will comply with all applicable state, 
local and regional laws for protecting the rights and welfare of human patient s. This protocol 
and any protocol amendment  (s) will be reviewed/a pproved by an IEC before its 
Protocol number DNDi -CH-E1224 -003    
 May 04, 2018 .  Version  5.0.   
Confidential  Page 81 of 87 
 implementation.  
It is the responsibility of the National Coordinating Investigator/Investigator to apply 
for review to the IEC of the country where the trial takes place regarding local rules and 
regulations. Written approval from all involved IECs must be obtained before implementation 
of any protocol -specified intervention /investigation provided to the patient . 
Any modifications made to the protocol after receipt of the IEC approval must also be 
submitted by the investigator  in writing to the IEC in accordance with local procedures and 
regulatory requirements.  
15.1.  Informed consent process  
Inclusion in the trial will occur only if the patient  gives written informed consent. It is 
the responsibility of the investigator/designee to obtain voluntary written informed consent from 
each individual participating in this trial, after adequate presentation of aims, methods, 
anticipated benefits, and po tential hazards of the trial. The written informed consent document 
will be translated into the local language or a language understood by the patient  (s). The 
patient  will be given time to discuss the information received with members of the community 
or family before deciding to consent. The patient  will be asked to provide written and signed 
consent.  
If the patient  is illiterate  or unable to write , s/he will include a mark in the form and a 
literate witness must sign (this person should have no connectio n to the research team  and 
the sponsor , and, if possible, should be selected by the participant).  
If new safety information results in significant changes in the risk/benefit assessment, 
the consent form should be reviewed and updated if necessary. All patients (including those 
already being treated) should be informed of the new information, given a copy of the revised 
form and give their consent to continue in the trial.  
15.2.  Ethical aspects of patient  inclusion and trial procedures  
 
Only eligible  patient s for Chagas therapy according to national guidelines and for 
whom Benznidazole standard treatment is indicated will be enrolled in this trial. The 
management of their disease and therapy will follow national guidelines. In comparison with 
current BZN stand ard treatment, the new therapeutic approaches for CD using different doses 
and duration of BZN, as well as combinations , target an improve ment in  treatment response 
and tolerability and reduce the potential for development of resistance . 
Participants  on this trial may experience discomfort during examination and blood 
sampling.

 The total volume of blood collected during the trial is about 322 mL for all evaluations  
(around 20 table spoons) . The amount of blood drawn does not cause anaemia or problems 
UelaWed Wo Whe bod\¶V defence mechaniVmV.  The maximal quantity during 1 visit is 28mL 
(equivalent to 2  table spoons).  
15.3.  Ethical aspects of trial treatments  
 
Clinical data  demonstrated  that E1224  has potential for the specific treatment of T. 
cruzi  infections  at EOT  and with a proportion of patients sustaining parasitological response 
until 6 months . Phase 1 trials  in healthy volunteers receiving E1224  suggest that the 
investigational drug has a satisfactory safety profile.  A Phase 1 drug -drug interaction trial which 
assessed the interaction of BNZ and E1224 showed that both compounds were well tolerated, 
in monotherapy and combination. The lack of clinically relevant safety findings provided 
support for follow -up evaluation of the two compounds in combinat ion. Likewise, experimental 
data suggest a positive interaction between BZN and azole compounds for the treatment of 
Chagas disease.  
 A placebo comparator has been selected for this trial. Due to the chronic nature of 
Chagas Disease  and slow progression of organs impairment  there is no evidence of a 
significant risk for adult patient s recruited to the placebo group  within the timelines of trial 
evaluation . All patient s will be offered treatment at the end of the  trial. This arm will provide a 
control for the therapeutic efficacy assessment of Benznidazole and BZN/E1224 alternative 
regimens . In addition , it will allow a more complete evaluation of PCR as an outcome measure 
for CD clinical trials.  
15.4.  Patient  costs  
Patient s will be reimbursed for travel to and from the trial site and in case of any lost 
day(s) of work, but will not receive any payment for trial participation. Any  treatment for trial -
related injuries  that is required during the trial period will be provided fr ee of charge to the 
patient .  
16. INSURANCE AND LIABILITY  
DNDi will provide insurance against claims arising from the trial, except for claims that 
arise from malpractice and/or negligence. In addition, the DNDi will address the costs of 
treatment of trial patient s in the event of trial -related injuries in accordance with the applicable 
regulatory requirements.  
17. REPORTING AND PUBLICA TION 
This clinical trial will be registered with a recognized clinical trial registry  and a final 
clinical trial report will be  generated .

 The results of this trial may be published or presented at scientific meetings. If this is 
foreseen, the investigator agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to DNDi prior to 
submission.  
In accord with standard editorial and ethical pra ctice, the sponsor will generally 
support publication of multicenter trials only in their entirety and not as individual center data. 
Any formal publication of the trial in which input of DNDi personnel exceeded that of 
conventional monitoring will be cons idered as a joint publication by the investigator and the 
appropriate DNDi personnel. Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement.
