EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Providing evidence that corroborates conformity with the General Safety and Performance Requirements outlined in Annex I of EU 2017/745 MDR and EU 2017/746 IVDR is a complex process 
that requires the identification, retrieval, appraisal and critical analysis of a wide range of data covering the entire lifetime of a medical device and/or an in-vitro diagnostic medical device.

Preclinical studies, verification and validation data including design and manufacturing aspects, clinical investigations, post-market surveillance activities as well as up-to-date risk management data are pieces of a puzzle that is never complete without the clinical evaluation of the medical device.
The clinical evaluation report (CER) in its turn, heavily relies on the State of the Art (SotA) discussion to identify whether
 the medical and/or in-vitro diagnostic medical device achieves its intended purpose without exposing users and patients to unidentified risks and
 the benefit/risk ratio for the medical device is acceptable when weighed against the benefits to the patient
Nevertheless, there is no consensus on what State of the Art is or what it should discuss. In this paper
 we will discuss the challenges a CER author will have to overcome while building up a SoTA section, we will discuss resources and practical solutions/best practices to 
facilitate its preparation.

CLINICAL EVALUATION REPORT, STATE OF THE ART PAGE www.evnia.dk | info@evnia.dk | 0045 88 82 57 97THE CLINICAL 
EVALUATION AS PART OF TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION
A Clinical Evaluation is the assessment and analysis of clinical data 
pertaining to a medical device and/or in-vitro diagnostic medical device and is intended to document and verify all aspects of its clinical safety and performance as well as to confirm accuracy of the accompanying labelling. 
Clinical evaluation is a risk-assessment based process taking into account 
pre- and post-market clinical data from various sources (e.g. clinical investigations, vigilance databases, PMCF activities etc.) as well as verification and validation data of the device in scope, which are cross-checked with benchmark and/or equivalent devices with the same intended use. 
The process, which is documented in a clinical evaluation report (hereinafter 
CER) that is part of the Technical Documentation (TechDoc) of the medical device in scope, aims to provide conclusive evidence that the medical device 
 fulfils the General Safety and Performance Requirements outlined inAnnex I of EU 2017/745 MDR
1 and EU 2017/746 IVDR2
 achieves its intended purpose without exposing users and patients tounidentified risks
 the benefit/risk ratio for the medical device is acceptable whenweighed against the benefits to the patient.

SCOPE OF THIS PAPER
The State of the Art (hereinafter SotA) section stands in the core 
of a Clinical Evaluation Report (CER) for Medical Devices prepared 
under the requirements of EU 2017/745 MDR and EU 2017/746 
IVDR. The regulatory demand for a coherent risk/benefit narrative 
and a rigorous juxtaposition of systematically collected data 
associated with all facets of the corresponding medical field 
is one of the primary objectives of the CER author. However, 
preparing a SotA section is often linked to a number of pitfalls and 
challenges that may introduce delays, narrative ambivalence and 
even jeopardize the credibility of conclusions drawn in the CER. 
The purpose of this paper is to discuss such challenges, 
identify their potential sources and propose solutions and/
or some best practices that a CER author will be able to 
implement in his/her everyday practice. Moreover, this paper 
intents to provide some best practices for SotA writing in CERs.

CLINICAL EVALUATION REPORT, STATE OF THE ART PAGE www.evnia.dk | info@evnia.dk | 0045 88 82 57 97DEFINING THE STATE 
OF THE ART
The term “State of the Art” is mentioned 12 times  in the EU 2017/745 MDR and 20 
times in EU 2017/746 IVDR but lacks an explicit definition. There have been various 
efforts to define “State of the Art” (see Table 1) but up until the time this paper was 
published, there was no consensus over its definition. Even the recent MDCG 2020-
133 document, intending to provide a guidance to Notified Bodies how to assess CERs, 
provides a whole section with points on what should be included in a SotA without 
actually defining what SotA is in the context of the new Medical Device Regulations!
Nevertheless, although we know more about what SotA is not and less about how to frame 
it (see Figure 1), all available definitions highlight that SotA is bounded by the intended 
use of the medical device. As an integral part of the CER, SotA section is expected to 
frame the intended medical field and identify alternative treatment options and potential 
similar/benchmark and/or equivalent devices. Once identified, SotA discussion should 
aim to retrieve evidence on risks associated with the intended use that will allow the the 
comparison of device-specific risk management and vigilance data with alternative practices. 
However, the purpose of a well-structured and MDR-compliant SotA section is not only to layout 
hazards and complications but rather to identify the safety and performance endpoints to 
be used for the assessment of clinical (and non-clinical when applicable, e.g. biomechanical) 
data that will be used to determine the acceptability of the device’s benefit-risk profile.

MEDDEV 2.7.1. rev46Includes applicable standards and guidance documents, data that relate to benchmark 
devices, other devices, critical components and medical alternatives or to the specific 
medical conditions and patient populations intended to be managed with the 
device. The data are typically needed in order to - describe the clinical background 
and identify the current knowledge/ state of the art in the corresponding medical 
field, - identify potential clinical hazards (including hazards due to substances and 
technologies, manufacturing procedures and impurity profiles), - justify the validity 
of criteria used for the demonstration of equivalence (if equivalence is claimed), - 
justify the validity of surrogate endpoints (if surrogate endpoints are used). […] A 
review of the current knowledge/ the state of the art needed for the proper conduct 
of the appraisal and analysis of the clinical data of the device under evaluation and 
the equivalent device (i.e. applicable standards and guidance documents, information 
on the medical conditions that are relevant to the clinical evaluation, therapeutic/ 
management/ diagnostic options available for the intended patient population, etc.)
STATE OF THE ART IS NOT
• The most innovative
• The most technologically advanced
• The most expensive
• The most frequently used
• The less “dangerous” (use-associated risks) medical device and/
or in vitro diagnostic deviceTherefore, it should be clear that the link of SotA to Risk Management is extremely 
strong within the context of the new Medical Device Regulations. The two seemingly 
unrelated sections of the CER need to fully align:  risk analysis should correspond to the 
State of the Art and the State of the Art should confirm that there are no new/previously 
unidentified risks  associated with the intended use of the device in scope (see Annex I, Chpt 
1, par.1 & 4). This two-fold crosscheck enables the CER author (therefore the Manufacturer) 
to provide adequate information on intended purpose, proper use and warnings about 
risks to patients and healthcare professionals and to make an informed decision on 
whether the Instructions of Use/labelling of the device in scope require a revision.

OF THE ART SECTION WHEN AUTHORING A CERState of the Art Section in CERs has a co-dependent relationship with 
literature review. Technically, the CER SotA is something between 
a systematic review and a meta-analysis (see Figure 2) as it 
needs to set up a robust methodology to search, appraise, interpret and report both qualitative and quantitative data of the literature. 
In the following pages, we describe how to build up a SoTA section 
in ten steps and discuss the decisions that need to be made and 
required resources.

CLINICAL EVALUATION REPORT, STATE OF THE ART PAGE www.evnia.dk | info@evnia.dk | 0045 88 82 57 97INTRODUCTION 
WHAT TO DISCUSS
The CER author has to frame the device in scope within the current medical landscape in order to justify that 
it is at least equally safe with similar/benchmark and/or equivalent devices and does not introduce any new 
or unidentified risks or hazards compared with alternative treatment options having the same intended use. 
State of the Art is bounded by the intended use of the device and the intended medical field. Therefore, all 
aspects of the medical condition intended to be treated by the device have to be discussed, including but not 
limited to, epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations and comorbidities (if applicable).
Delimitation of the medical condition will enable the discussion of available treatments (similar/benchmark/
equivalent devices and alternative treatment options). This strategy ensures that standards of care are 
taken into consideration. 
Identification and incorporation into the SotA of Clinical Practice Guidelines  and/or consensus statements 
released by Medical Associations serves this cause by illustrating the benefit/risk profile of each approach and 
providing a first summary of associated hazards and complications. Additionally, combination of guidelines 
and meta-analyses data help the CER author formulate the list of safety and performance endpoints to 
be considered during clinical data extraction for similar/ benchmark/equivalent devices and device in scope. 
Their identification through SotA will maximize consistency across data analysis and will ensure that no 
clinical aspects associated with the use of the medical device are oversighted.
SotA should always identify the risks associated with both the intended medical field and intended 
purpose of the device in scope. This is the stepping stone for the analysis of clinical data in the CER and 
final conclusion on whether conformity with GSPRs is achieved. 
The goal is to prove that a device remains state of the art without introducing new and/or non-
mitigated risks when performing as intended. 
Multiple sections of MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev 4 describe the content of a SotA section and MDCG 2020-13 also 
provides such an overview (see Table 2) focusing on the need to collect and properly appraise clinical 
data for benchmark and/or equivalent devices as well as for alternative treatment options. Table 2: What to discuss in an MDR-compliant SotA section

TIPTHE PICO PROCESS
PICO is a format used for the development of proper clinical research questions  
prior to start building a literature search strategy. Α CER author needs to build a 
search plan that will enable identification of data related to the intended medical 
field, population, treatment (including alternative ones) and potential complications 
associated with the device in scope. These actually make up the four elements of the 
PICO model: Patient/ Problem, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome (see Table 3) 
Once a well-structured question is formulated, the CER author will be in position to search 
the literature for evidence that will support the device’s performance/safety profile.

PLANNING AND 
EXECUTION OF THE 
SEARCH STRATEGY
SOURCES OF DATA
Once the major elements of the research question have been identified, next 
step is to “translate” the general terms to subject descriptors, i.e. MeSH or 
EMTREE terms. To do this, clinical data sources should be identified in parallel. 
Usually, SotA is built up from clinical literature from peer-reviewed journals, 
clinical practice guidelines and/or standards and in some cases, clinical trials or 
medical devices registries if extraction of comprehensive safety data is feasible.
Keep in mind that terms/descriptors might differ significantly from one database to 
another, which has an impact to the final search strategy and corresponding results.DescriptionGeneration of

Review, Review39Note in this example that the search for Hospital Acquired infection  in the 
MeSH database resulted in “Cross Infection”[Mesh] , which is defined by 
PubMed as “Any infection which a patient contracts in a health-care institution” . 
Since the MeSH term definition involved a different patient group than the 
target population, search strategy has to be adapted in order to try to narrow 
down the broader “Infections”[MeSH Terms] via the appropriate use of 
parentheses, AND & OR Boolean terms in the P specific search string (see below).
In this case, the outcome of interest which is “reduced infection” is sufficiently covered by 
MeSH terms present in the P and the C part of the search string, (“Hand Hygiene”[Mesh])), 
“Hand Disinfection”[Mesh])  and as such the search string can be considered complete. Of 
note, that the word “Gloves” produced 10 more results when used as a text word and not 
as a MeSH term. Therefore, the CER author might consider choosing search string No 2.

Tip: The NOT Boolean operator can 
be very useful during initial, pilot 
searches but it might be better to 
avoid its use in the final search  string

Finds records where the word hospital is 
listed first, followed by the word infection, 
and where no more than one word 
separates the two terms.As seen already, an optimized search also requires the use of Boolean and/or 
Proximity operators.  
Boolean operators are the words “AND”, “OR” and “NOT’’ . When properly combined 
with search terms, they refine results and minimize unnecessary “noise’’. To optimize 
even further the use of Boolean operators, parentheses can be used to nest query terms.
Proximity (or adjacency) operators allow to search by phrase or with two or more 
words in relation to one another. 
WILDCARDS AND  
TRUNCATION SYMBOLS
These refer to advanced search techniques used to substitute a symbol for one letter of a 
word, which may be useful if a word is spelled in different ways, but still has the same meaning. 
The most commonly used wildcard is the asterisk (*) used to specify any number 
of characters. When used at the end of a root word, it is referred to as truncation . 
This can be very useful when searching for variable endings of a root word.For example:   
child*= child, childs, children, childrens, childhood  
genetic* = genetic, genetics, genetically  
A question mark (?) may be used to represent a single character, anywhere in the 
word.  It is most useful when there are variable spellings for a word and the search has 
to include all variants at once.  
For example, searching for colo?r  would return both color and colour. 
Truncation is database-specific and there may be differences in symbols and/or 
selectivity across them. In most databases use of quotation arks around 
the terms will allow them ot be searched as a 
phrase, e.g. “disinfecting solutions”, “nursing staff” TIP
11
CLINICAL EVALUATION REPORT, STATE OF THE ART PAGE www.evnia.dk | info@evnia.dk | 0045 88 82 57 97
It is always a good idea to run a few pilot searches before finalizing the 
search algorithm you will be using to make sure you have developed 
a strategy that minimizes “noise” without without interfering with 
relevant data. For example reduce the “noise” by identifying search 
terms that are also common to non-relevant medical fields, and 
exclude them in the search string with a NOT Boolean operator.SELECTION OF DATABASES
Combination of systematic searches in different databases with 
potential hand searches is the optimal approach to identify information 
pertinent to the level of data required for an MDR-compliant CER. 
With this approach, specific articles and/or data known to the CER author 
via other pathways (e.g. a given study that came to their attention in a 
previous project and/or during research activities) are also retrieved.
In this context, the most popular databases used are PubMed, Embase, 
Cochrane library and Google Scholar7,8,9.
MEDLINE® is the National Library of Medicine® (NLM®) journal citation 
database, including citations from > 5,600 scholarly journals, which 
are subject to review by a NIH-chartered advisory committee before 
acceptance. PubMed, which has been available since 1996 and 
focuses on Medicine/Biomedicine and satellite specialties is currently 
estimated to have >25 mi references included in the MEDLINE database.
EMBASE is an Elsevier database with > 32 mi citations from over 2,900 indexed 
journals unique to EMBASE and > 2.4 mi conference abstracts indexed from > 
7,000 conferences. EMBASE also focuses on Medicine/Biomedicine and satellite 
specialties. The EMTREE function, a collection of standardized keywords within 
Embase, allows organization of biomedical terms in a broader sense.  Emtree 
terms are added to articles to describe the content of an article in a uniform 
way. Articles entered in Embase are automatically assigned Emtree via an 
algorithm and later manually checked and corrected by Embase indexers.
Cochrane Library is a collection of databases that contain different types 
of evidence, namely the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
(CENTRAL), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Health 
Technology Assessment (HTA) Database. The library lies into the Cochrane 
Database Systematic Reviews (CDSR), a database of peer-reviewed 
systematic reviews in health care prepared by Cochrane Review Groups.
Google Scholar  is a scientific search engine with an extremely wide range of 
interdisciplinary results. Google Scholar searches the full text of articles and is 
also likely to retrieve clinical data from non-peer-reviewed sources, which makes 
it more suitable for hand searching information rather than systemic searches.TIP

• Although Clinical Trials Database (e.g. Clinicaltrial.gov) is NOT peer-reviewed, it represents a potential useful source 
of clinical data especially in situations where data is limited and publication bias might emerge. The clinical trials 
database may be searched for both similar / benchmark / equivalent device(s) and the device in scope. However, its 
use in SotA section might not be necessary if a thorough systemic search is executed (searches in Chochrane library 
will retrieve results from clinicaltrials.gov).
• PubMed was rebuilt in May 2020 into a cloud-based service aiming to allow greater scalability. These changes have 
resulted in increased number of returned hits compared with the legacy version, likely due to:
• automatic term mapping,
• removal of the previous limit to 600 iterations when using a wildcard (*) search, and
• default search now ignores Boolean operations (AND, OR, etc.), and defers to PubMed’s own “best match” 
algorithm.
This has a major regulatory implication: replication of searches by Auditors and/or Competent Authorities will 
eventualy not be possible although legacy PubMed will remain (inactively) available in this link: https://pmlegacy.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
• Embase has featured a dedicated Section for medical devices with comprehensive content and search strategies 
indexing trade names linked to Manufacturer names https://www.embase.com/search/medicalDevice
• If you are looking to manage Google Scholar hits, consider using Publish or Perish, a software program that retrieves 
and analyzes academic citations form a variety of data sources including Google Scholar. Get it here: https://harzing.
com/resources/publish-or-perish. Keep in mind it might require a few pilot searches before finalizing the features 
that match your search
• Scopus database, developed by Elsevier, includes Cited References and incorporates searches of scientific web 
pages through Scirus. It indexes Medline. Although it covers a very wide range of disciplines that may result in 
increased noise, it is particularly useful when searching for proceedings of abstractsDID

FILTERS
Before executing a literature search, there is a number of decisions to make 
with respect to potential filters that may or may not be applied in order to 
ensure that State of the Art will be indeed reflected in the identified results.
  Date range
Depending on the novelty introduced by the device in scope and the 
maturity of the intended medical field, searching the 5-10 last years is 
usually sufficient to depict both standards of care and State of the Art.
  Language restrictions
New Medical Device Regulations allow no excuses for exclusion of data 
due to language restrictions . This often adds an extra financial load to 
Manufacturers but exclusion due to language might introduce bias and jeopardizes 
comprehensiveness of evidence with respect to safety and performance data.   Types of articles
To outline the State of the Art, a CER author will probably need to focus on 
published studies in peer-reviewed journals providing high level of evidence (see 
section Appraisal Criteria). Inclusion of unpublished studies may be considered 
to avoid publication bias however, the CER author will have to ensure that 
there is access to sufficient information for the assessment of methodology 
and/or outcomes. When possible, SoTA searches should be limited in reviews, 
systematic reviews, meta-analyses and Clinical Practice Guidelines 
further delimited by data derived from studies in humans. Nevertheless, 
depending on the special features of a medical device, the need to identify and 
discuss biomechanical, pre-clinical and/or other technical issues might emerge.
GUIDELINES 
  Clinical Practice Guidelines are the core of a CER-related SotA section 
because they collect and revise all alternative treatment options for a given 
medical field from a clinical perspective. Therefore, their identification 
and critical presentation is mandatory. Table 4 summarizes some 
sources for retrieval of Guidelines but a CER author should keep in mind 
that identification of clinical practice Guidelines usually requires hand 
searches based on the nature of the intended purpose of a medical device.Make a habit of running a search for historical articles (there is 
a dedicated checkbox for this in the new PubMed). This might 
retrieve useful information on the evolution of the medical field 
and the alternative treatment options that could explain why the 
device in scope remains State of the Art!Make an informed decision on inclusion of articles based on 
language criteria by taking into consideration the countries / 
geographical areas a device is marketed in as well as respective 
local clinical practice Guidelines because this might allow to draw 
conclusions on specific practices that introduce hazards and risks.

CLINICAL EVALUATION REPORT, STATE OF THE ART PAGE www.evnia.dk | info@evnia.dk | 0045 88 82 57 97Before moving on to analysis of results, it is of utmost importance to run a control check and 
identify potential errors in the search strategy that could affect the integrity of information 
retrieved and therefore the reproducibility and validity of the systematic search approach. 
A study by Sampson and McGowan10  identified that the commonest search 
errors in search strategies using MEDLINE were associated with missed MeSH 
terms (44.4%), whereas free text terms or irrelevant MeSH terms were also noted (28.6%). A well-established source for search strategy optimization is the 
PRESS tool  where the CER author may verify his/her work through the available 
checklist that addresses the research question, use of Boolean and proximity 
operators, subject headings, text word search, spelling, syntax, limits and filters.Table 4: Guideline sources and depositories

CLINICAL EVALUATION REPORT, STATE OF THE ART PAGE www.evnia.dk | info@evnia.dk | 0045 88 82 57 97ANALYSIS OF RESULTS 
Upon completion of literature searches, articles are screened and selected for inclusion to the SotA discussion
APPRAISAL CRITERIA
Selection is usually progressing via a two-step process: a) Abstract screening b) Full-text 
screening) on the basis of: 
• Relation to the intended medical field 
• Nature of data, which should be focusing on clinical evidence (see also section 
Selection of databases-Types of articles ) pertinent to the intended purpose of the 
device in scope 
For identified clinical data on similar/benchmark/equivalent devices and/or alternative 
treatment options, appraisal should be based on:• Data Suitability, i.e.  assessment of safety and performance endpoints of the 
device in question and
• Data Contribution, i.e. assessment of data quality 
Criteria for data suitability and contribution (see Table 5) may vary according to the special 
features of a medical device and intended medical field. Overall, there is no consensus on 
appraisal plans but they all need to consider potential sources of bias associated with study 
designs/reporting, sample sizes, clinical settings involved, sources of funding, variability of 
results, comparisons, statistical methods and applicability to a specific medical device milieu. 
Table 5: Appraisal Criteria
Data contribution appraisal criteria Data suitability appraisal criteria
Data source type Was the design of the study approrpriate? Appropriate deviceWere the data generated from the device in 
question?
Outcome measuresDo the outcome measures reported reflect the 
intended performance of the device?Appropriate device application Was the device used for the same intended use?
Follow-upIs the duration of follow-up long enough to assess 
whether duration of treatment effects and identify 
complications?Appropriate patient groupWhere the data generated from a patient group 
that is representative of the intended treatment 
population (e.g., age, sex, etc.) and clinical condition 
(i.e., disease, including state and severity)?
Statistical SignificanceHas a statistical analysis of the data been provided and 
is it appropriate (to consider sample size)?Acceptable report/data 
collectionDo the reports or collations of data contain sufficient 
information to be able to undertake a rational and 
objective assessment?
Clinical SignificanceWas the magnitude of the treatment effect observed 
clinically significant?

Data source type related to the design of a study are graded based on levels 
of evidence and determine whether the methods and results presented 
answer the research question set by its authors and consequently, whether 
this particular study will be analysed in a qualitative or quantitative way12.
As already discussed above (see section Selection of databases - Filters), the SotA 
section of an MDR-compliant CER should normally take into account high level of 
evidence sources as described by OCEBM-Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine13. 
Higher level of evidence such as systematic reviews and meta-analyses are regularly 
prioritized in the search strategy for the general SotA section offering a substantial overview 
of the associated medical field. Most importantly, high quality meta-analysis reports can be a comprehensive source of scientifically valid comparative information for the benefits 
and risks associated with different treatment options, contributing to a core requirement 
of the section’s objective. The classification for levels of evidence provided in Figure 
5 is a starting point for the initial evaluation of retrieved literature but it’s unequivocal 
that the CER author should deploy analytical thought and apply objective appraisal 
criteria  in order to assess the quality of each study.  It is also suggested that the CER 
author consults some reference books that could help at this stage such as Finding What 
Works in Healthcare (Standards for Systematic Reviews) and, of course, Cochrane Handbook 
for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (the latter is also referred by Med. Dev 2.7.1 / Rev. 4). 
Meta-Analysis: A systematic review that uses quantitative methods to 
summarize the results.
Systematic Review: Detailed and comprehensive plan and search strategy 
derived a priori, with the goal of reducing bias by identifying appraisingm and 
synthesizing all relevant studies on a specific topic.
Review: Qualitative summary of multiple research studies evaluating and 
summarizing individual research studies.
Randomized Controlled Trials: A study design that randomly assigns 
particpants into an experimental or a control group and follows up the 
outcomes of interest.
Cohort Study:  This study identifies a group of people and follows them over a 
period of time to identify how their exposures affect their outcomes.
Case-Report: An article that describes and interprets an inidividual case, often 
written in the form of a detailed story.
Background Information / Expert Opinion:  A scientific view or judgment 
about something given by an expert or group of experts for a specific topic.
Animal Research / Lab Studies: Use of non-human animals in experiments 
that seek to control the variables that affect the behaviour or biological system 
under study.

NARRATIVE DEVELOPMENT
Discussion and assembly of the SotA section is maybe the most critical part of the preparation 
chain. This is the step where all data come to place and are presented in a coherent, critical 
manner that will enable the reader to judge whether the purpose of the section has been served. 
Consider the following when structuring the narrative:
  Use a PRISMA-like flow diagram14  (see Figure 6) to visualize the results of your 
literature search.
  Check for plagiarism: although there are no explicit guidelines for plagiarism in 
CERs, make sure you do not copy-paste from articles and cite properly providing 
access to full-text. For more info on plagiarism in CERs, check our e-book 
“Plagiarism In Clinical Evaluation Reports (CERs): What To Look Out For’’, available in 
our website https://www.evnia.dk/
  Make sure the final text is readable and fluent: watch out for lengthy sentences and 
wrong choice of words. Match one thought in one sentence and avoid pompous 
words.
  Separate your themes by paragraphs and summarize when needed to help the 
reader follow your writing rationale.
  Use hyperlinks to guide the reader through the various CER sections and enhance 
comprehension.
  Be sure to add a conclusive statement that the device in scope is and/or 
remains State of the Art.Records identified through

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
Although the last years penetration of Artificial Intelligence in all aspects 
of Healthcare is constantly growing, there is currently no official guidance 
on the use of AI-based extraction data software for the preparation 
of MDR-compliant CERs. There are currently various such products 
enabling the dynamic interaction of CER authors with software features 
for maximization of extraction but no evidence is available to specify 
their approval by Competent authorities. However, their use cannot be 
excluded if the CER Author incorporates them into a robust appraisal plan.  REFERENCES MANAGEMENT
Manual formatting of citations, especially within the context of a 
regulatory document, such as a CER, can be very frustrating as well 
as time-consuming. Familiarization of the CER author with a citation 
management tool (see Figure 7) will allow import, organization and 
management of citations and associated full-text articles in an almost 
fully-automatic way. Currently available reference management software 
, such as Endnote, Zotero, RefWorks, Mendeley can all import references 
from various databases, create in-text citations and bibliographies 
and import bibliographic information from web pages, while enabling 
the user to transit between citation styles and the ability to edit them.
• When choosing reference management software, consider the following:
• Usability / ease of use
• Compatibility with operating system and databases the user works with more 
frequently
• Support (availability of training courses, support, lines, e-forums)
• Cost-features ratio
• Avoid online citation builders. An MDR-compliant CER requires full access to referenced 
articles, therefore a reference management software is a more efficient approach to 
collect and provide access to your pool of literature data.
• Keep a well-organized record, e.g. use separate folders for each general search category 
and each executed search. It will enhance record keeping, deduplication of results and 
systematic reporting for the SotA.
Figure 7: Examples of reference management software and their main featuresREFERENCE MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE ALLOWS TO:
• Manage all sources in one place and organize references into 
folders more sufficiently
• Upload and store full-text PDFs and other file types
• Install plug-ins for word processors that accelerate insertion of 
citations
• Share libraries in private or open groups
• Automatically remove duplicatesTIP

TAKE-HOME MESSAGES
Building up a SOTA section for a Clinical Evaluation Report is a multi-
step process that requires solid scientific background, technical skills 
and the ability to rationally design and execute a literature strategy. 
In this paper, we have summarized this process in ten steps and we have 
provided some practical solutions to enable the CER author to comply with 
current regulatory requirements. Here are the keypoints: 
Key Points
  Use the PICO methodology to structure search strings that will 
reduce the number of required searches and will enhance record 
keeping.
  Define eligibility criteria with precision and a rationale that 
matches the profile of the device in scope.
  Make a thorough search for Clinical Practice Guidelines and 
discuss the findings in detail.
  Invest time to fully identify alternative treatment options and 
similar/benchmark and/or equivalent devices.
  Do not underestimate the usefulness of pilot searches and 
verification of search results.
  Learn the tools: use a reference management software that will 
allow consistency and access to your pool of data.
Remember your goal:
  A SotA section is expected to frame the intended medical field 
in a way that will allow identification of alternative treatment 
options and potential equivalent/benchmark devices. Therefore, 
it should aim to retrieve data on risks associated with the 
intended use in order to enable the comparison of device-specific 
risk management and vigilance data with the broader field. 
  The purpose of a well-structured, MDR-compliant SotA section is not 
only to layout hazards and complications but rather to define and clarify 
safety and performance endpoints to be used for the assessment of 
clinical (and non-clinical when applicable, e.g. biomechanical) data.
  Add a conclusive statement at the end of the SoTA determining 
whether the device in scope is and/or remains State of the Art.
