Section 15.2.6:  
− HCV replaced by HCV antibody or HCV-Ab, respectively. 
o Table  1: 
− To avoid redundancy, assessments of blood biochemistry, hematology, and 
urinalysis deleted for S1 as all 3 assessments are part of the screening labs, which 
will be done at S1. 
− Lab Kits for genotyping (G) and miR- 122 (BM) assessment were listed separately.

Confidential   
 − Under Lab K its included that there will be 2 BM Kits at V0 because miR -122 will 
be assessed 2x at V0, at 0 and 4  hours after first IMP administration.  
− Clarified that the extended treatment period can be blinded or unblinded (respective 
heading and footnote added). 
− Included t hat the Week 24 MRI can be repeated if the initial MRI was not at least 
partially assessable. 
− Time window for V2 (Week 6) changed  from ±7 days to -7/+4 days , because the

statistically significant decrease in combined unique active (CUA) lesions was observed with teriflunomide compared to placebo after 1 week of treatment.’  
Corrected to:  
‘In a Phase 2 trial of teriflunomide on patients with relapsing forms of MS, a statistically significant decrease in combined unique active (CUA) lesions was observed with teriflunomide compared to placebo after 12 weeks of treat ment.’  
o Section 8.2 (6
th paragraph):  
Bracket s in ‘The schedule of MRI testing selected is more frequent (every 6 weeks) 
than usually used in clinical routine, as Gd+ lesions offer the best evidence of recent inflammatory white matter lesions (which cause clinical attacks) .’ removed since not 
every white matter lesion causes a clinical attack.  
o Section 10.5 : 
Patient identifier changed from ‘YY -XXZZ’ to ‘YYXX- ZZ.’ 
o Section 12.2 : 
To avoid confusion ‘evaluating physician’ was replaced by ‘independent MRI reader’ in the following sentence under Screening Visit 2: 
‘The quality of the baseline MRI will be assessed centrally and may be repeated as 
soon as possible, if considered necessary by the evaluating physician independent 
MRI reader.’

• Version 3.0, dated 28- Aug-2020 
The protocol was primarily amended to include a Cohort 2 sub- trial with the objective to 
obtain more data for pharmacodynamic modelling  of IMU -838 by evaluating a lower 
IMU -838 dose in the presumed effective dose range, i.e. 10 mg/day IMU -838. The analysis 
of the main treatment period show ed equal safety and efficacy between the 30  mg/day and 
45 mg/day doses. The sub- trial will be randomized, double -blind and placebo- controlled 

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial  protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)   Page 6 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 with patients being randomized 1:4  to placebo and  10 mg/day IMU -838 for 24 weeks. The 
total number of patients will be approximately 60. Based on the results from an interim 
analysis of the ongoing T rial P2 -IMU -838- UC, the 10 mg dose is part of the possible 
effective dose range of IMU -838 in immunological diseases. Assessments and procedures 
will mostly follow those described for the main treatment period in the main trial. An 
unblinded interim analysis on ma in parameters is planned to be performed after 12  weeks 
of treatment. Details of this Cohort 2 sub- trial study are described in an Appendix  
(Appendix 3 ) and a summary is included in Section 1. This Cohort 2 sub- trial will not be 
valid in Romania. 
Additional changes included in Version 3.0 compared with Version 2.0 were: 
o Title page and Section 2 : 
Sponsor address changed. 
o Table  1: 
− Clarified that blood collection to determine IMU -838 trough levels at EoT will only 
be performed until the last patient in the Cohort 2 sub- trial has completed the last 
sub-trial visit . 
− Description of visits for patients continuing from Cohort 2 was added. 
o Section 1 and Section 22 : 
Trial duration adjusted.  
o Section 4  
Updated 
o Section 6  
Additional eCRF provider added 
o Section 11.2.3:  
Added that special care must be taken if ibuprofen is used as concomitant medication 
and whenever possible therapeutic alternatives should be used. 
o Section 15.2 : 
Clarified that clinically significantly abnormal values must be reported as AE, unless 
there are known circumstances unrelated to a disease or the medication (such as patient activities or sam ple handling) that are a likely explanations for the abnormal value. 
o Section 15.2.2.1 
Added that serum s amples collected at Baseline, stored but not used for the primary 
analysis (“B-sample” ), may be used in future research to evaluate other MS related 
serum markers (e.g. Epstein -Barr Virus) and address MS -related research questions 
that may arise after trial completion .

 Trial  objectives  
Primary  
• To evaluate the efficacy of 45 mg/day IMU -838 in the treatment of RRMS based on MRI 
assessments  
Secondary  
• To evaluate the efficacy of 30 mg/day IMU -838 in the treatment of RRMS based on MRI 
assessments  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 30 mg/day and 45 mg/day IMU -838 in RRMS 
patients  
Tertiary  
• To evaluate pharmacodynamic  (PD) effects of IMU -838 in RRMS patients  
• To evaluate IMU -838 trough values and population pharmacokinetics ( PK)  
• To evaluate the effects of IMU -838 on treatment satisfaction  in patients with RRMS  
Methodology 
This is a P hase 2 multicenter, double -blind, placebo- controlled, randomized, parallel -group trial to 
assess the efficacy and safety of 2 once- daily oral doses of IMU -838 (30  mg/day and 45 mg/day) 
in patients with RRMS and evidence of active disease.  
The tr ial consists of a screening period, a blinded 24- week main treatment period, and an optional 
initially blinded, then open- label extended treatment period of up to 9.5 years.  
The trial i nclude s 2 patient cohorts:  
• Cohort 1 main trial : main Phase 2 trial with assessment of primary and key secondary 
endpoints.  
• Cohort 2 sub- trial: additional sub -trial with a small double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
randomized, parallel -group assessment of a low  IMU -838 dose (i.e. 10 mg/day)  to provide 
additi onal data for pharmacodynamic modelling. No formal statistical analysis will be 
performed, however in addition to analysis of Cohort 2 a pooled exploration of Cohorts 1 
and 2 for  pharmacodynamic modeling will be performed  (this Cohort 2 sub- trial will not 
be valid in Romania) . 
Screening period  
After the patient provided written informed consent, eligibility criteria will be checked and 
screening laboratory tests as well as a physical examination (including vital signs and 
electrocardiogram [ECG]) will be performed (Screening Visit 1).  

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial  protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)   Page 10 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 For eligible patients  based on the assessments of Screening Visit 1 , a baseline MRI (Screening 
Visit 2) will be performed which will serve as MRI reference for subsequent MRI assessments  
during the main treatment period . The quality of the baseline MRI will be evaluated by a  central  
independent MRI reader; if the quality of the MRI  is un acceptable, the baseline MRI may be 
repeated  once per patient, and the repeated MRI will be used as baseline MRI.  The central 
independent MRI  reader will also assess the presence of  Gadolinium- enhancing (Gd+) lesions as 
well as the number and volume of T2 lesions on the baseline MRI.  
Main treatment period  
On Day 0 , eligible patients will be randomized  in a 1:1:1 ratio to once -daily  oral treatment with 
30 mg IMU -838 or 45 mg IMU -838, or placebo for 24 weeks. All patients will receive half the 
assigned dose during the first 7 days of the main treatment period  (1 tablet per day) and then start 
taking the full assigned dose from Day 7 onward s (2 tablets once daily) . Clinic visits after Day 0 
during the main treatment period will be scheduled at Day 7, and at Weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24, 
including trial MRI examinations at Weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24. At Week 24 (end- of-main treatment 
period, EoMT), patients will have the option to continue into the extended treatment period  if they 
meet respective eligibility criteria including an MRI at Week 24 (see Inclusion criteria for optional  
extended treatment period  and Exclusion criteria for optional extended treatment period).  
Extended treatment period  (optional) 
During the extended treatment period, patients will receive 30  mg/day or 45 mg/day IMU -838 for 
up to 9.5 years. All patients will be randomized. Patients receiving placebo will be randomized to 
30 or 45 mg/day IMU -838. Patients on active treatment during the main treatment period will be 
randomized to continue their previous treatment assignment. Identical to the start of the main 
treatment period, all patients will receive half the assigned dose during the first 7  days of the 
extended treatment period  and will then continue with the full assigned dose.  
Clinic visits during the extended treatment period will be scheduled every 12 weeks.  
Once  the results of the main treatment period  are available, investigators and pati ents currently in 
the extended treatment period  will be unblinded and investigators will receive a top -line summary 
of trial results of the main treatment period . Considering these results, i nvestigators may then  
recommend switching  the dose for those pati ents currently  remain ing in the extended treatment 
period after time of study unblinding or thereafter ( after discussion and in consultation with the 
patient).  A potential dose switch can occur several times and at any clinic visit. A dose switch may 
allow patients to switch to a more effective dose  or to an equally effective dose but with a lower 
risk for adverse events (AEs).  
If at any time during this trial (main and extended treatment periods) a patient experiences between 
scheduled clinic visits symptoms indicative for a multiple sclerosis (MS ) relapse or a clinically

Confidential   
 relevant AE, which in the investigator’s opinion requires  additional safety assessments, the patient 
will be appropriately assessed at an unscheduled clinic visit.  
End-of-study visit  
All patients discontinuing treatment, as scheduled or prematurely, will undergo an EoS visit 
30 days (+14 days) after last  investigational medicinal product ( IMP) administration . 
Cohort 2 sub- trial 
The objective of the Cohort 2 sub -trial is to obtain exploratory data on the dose response of 
IMU -838 by evaluating  a lower IMU -838 dose i.e. 10 mg/day to  provide additional data for 
pharmacodynamic  modelling . The sub- trial will be randomized, double -blind and 
placebo -controlled with patients being randomized 1: 4 to placebo  and 10 mg/day IMU -838 for 
24 weeks. The total number of patients will be approximately 60. Assessments and procedures will 
mostly follow those described for the main treatment period in the main trial. Only MRI machines 
with a field  strength  of 1.5 Tes la will be allowed (the main trial allowed ≥1.5  Tesla) . In addition, 
an unblinded interim analysis of selected MRI data is planned to be performed after 12 weeks of 
treatment. Details of this sub -trial are described in an a ppendix and will not be further referred to 
in this synopsis  (this Cohort 2 sub- trial will not be valid in Romania).

Statistical methods  
The primary analysis will be performed after the end of the main treatment period and will be based 
on the full analysis set. The primary and key secondary endpoint s (cumulative number of CUA 
MRI lesions at Week 24) will be analyzed with  a generalized linear model with a negative binomial 
distribution and a logarithmic link function. Treatment group, baseline volume  of T2 lesions, field 
strength of the MRI machine (1.5 or 3.0 Tesla), and number of Gd+ lesions ( the latter 2 are factor 
groups used for stratif ication) will be included as independent effects in the models. The primary 
and the key secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed with a hierarchical testing procedure. Both tests will be performed at a significance level of 0.1 (1 -sided). In case of a non-significant 
result for the primary endpoint, the hierarchical testing procedure will be stopped, and the analysis of the key secondary endpoint will be exploratory.  
The sample size calculation is based on the primary endpoint assessed at Week  24 a fter the main 
treatment period.  
Assumptions:  
Primary endpoint: cumulative number of CUA MRI lesions up to  Week 24  
Randomization ratio:    1:1 (45 mg/day IMU -838:placebo)  
Power:    80% 
Significance level:    0.1, 1- sided  
Average exposure time:    24 weeks  
Mean event rate per 24 weeks for 45  mg/day IMU -838: 4.5 
Mean event rate per 24 weeks for placebo:   8.0 
Negative  binomial dispersion parameter:   1.7 
 Based on these assumptions the necessary sample size per group is 51. Assuming a drop -out rate 
of 25%, about 65 patients will be randomized to each of the dose groups.

a Within 28 days from Baseline (Day 0).  If the baseline MRI is repeated, the screening period maybe extended. However, patients must be randomized within 14 days of the 
repeated baseline MRI. Screening Visit 1 assessments will be valid for up to 60 days until the day of randomization, but will  have to be repeated if exceedi ng 60 days. If results 
of the baseline MRI assessments are not available within 14  days (either after the first or, if applicable, after the repeated MRI) randomization  can be delayed by up to 7  days , 
which may also result in an extension of the screening period.  
b Including the  history of autoimmune diseases  (other than MS). 
c Including height (only at Screening), respiratory rate, weight, blood pressure, pulse  rate, and body temperature. 
d Any positive local urine pregnancy test has to be followed up with a confirmatory local blood pregnancy test . 
e Includes PBMC -based  lymphocyte subset analysis  and T- cell clonal repertoire. To be performed in a subset of patient s and at selected “ Biomarker C enters” only.  
f Serum pregnancy test at central laboratory.  
g Samples to be stored at -20°C until next scheduled dry-ice shipment to central laboratory.

 h During the first week of treatment in the main and extended treatment period: 1 tablet once daily; other weeks : 2 tablets once daily.  
i The result of this local pregnancy test must be available and negative before the first IMP can be taken.  
j Patients who received placebo during the main treatment period  will be re -randomized to 30  mg or 45 mg IMU -838.  Patients previously on IMU -838 will be re-randomized to 
the sa me treatment they received during the main treatment period.  
k If the central reader evaluates the quality of the baseline MRI as not sufficient, the MRI must be repeated as soon as possible . 
l Taken at 3 to 10 hours post -dose  (in addition to the sample which is collected pre -dose at the same day for IMU -838 trough values).  
m If, based on new neurological symptoms  of the patient, the treating physician suspects that the patient may have an MS relapse (as defined in this protocol), an EDSS 
assessment by the evaluating physician and an assessment of MS relapse by the treating physician (based on the EDSS) must be performed at this visit.  
n The sample can be stored at -20°C for up to 1 year and dry ice shipment can be combined with another dry ice shipment.  
o The dry ice shipment should be generally done  immediately  after the Week  6, Week  24 or Eo S visit. However, it may be delayed by up to 2 weeks if the dry ice shipment can be 
combined with the dry ice shipment for another patient at the same site .  
p Only for patients who continue into the extended treatment phase.  
q Blinded until the data base lock and final analysis of the main treatment part; thereafter unblinded.  
r Can be repeated if initial MRI scan is not at least partially assessable.  
s To be performed only up to the time of last patient last visit of the main treatment period in the Cohort 2 sub-trial (Week 24). Investigators will be notified immediately . 
t The extended treatment period will be terminated for patients in the Cohort 2 sub-trial, at the day the last patient of the Cohort 1 main trial has completed or discontinued the 
extended treatment period  (which allows up to 9.5 years of ET  period).  The ET period for the se patients will thus be shorter (approximately up to 8.5 years).

 Study  P2-IMU -838-MS 
 
Reminder what should be considered for patient visits at the trial  center 
 
• Patients should be reminded throughout the trial to drink a generous amount 
of fluid per day (approximately 1.5 liters per day are recommended) to ensure 
adequate urine flow.  
• At all visits throughout the trial:  
o Patients should arrive at  the center in fasted condition (no food after 
midnight and in the morning before visit ) but patients are allowed to drink 
water even during periods of fasting (from midnight to next day visit).  
o For an individual patient visits should be scheduled at the s ame time in the 
morning so that visits are all within ±2 hours of the Day 0 visit.  
o At each visit, patients need to bring the IMP container to the center.  
 
• Applies only to main treatment period:  
o Patients should arrive at the center without having taken the  IMP.  
o If patients have inadvertently taken the IMP within 1.5 hours of arriving at 
the trial center, blood samples for trough levels will still be drawn. If the 
IMP intake was longer than 1.5 hours before arriving at the trial center, 
trough levels will no t be determined. Either case will be recorded as 
protocol deviation. Blood samples for biochemistry can be collected in any 
case and no additional visit to collect a blood sample for trough plasma 
levels needs to be scheduled.

 5 Introduction  
5.1 Multiple sclerosis  
5.1.1 Background 
Multiple sclerosis  (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous 
system (CNS) and is one of the most common causes of neurological disability in young adults. 
It affects up to 2.5 million people worldwide. Its prevalence varies between races and 
geographical latitudes, ranging from more than 100 per 100,000 people in Northern and Central 
Europe to 50 per 100,000 people in Southern Europe. 
It is characterized by multi -focal recurrent events of neurological symptoms and signs, with 
variable recovery. Most patients eventually develop a progressive clinical course. [2-4] 
The exact cause of MS  is unknown, although an autoimmune process is  implicated. A genetic 
basis plays a role in susceptibility to MS  [5,6] and environmental factors such as 
hypovitami nosis D and E pstein -Bar virus infect ions have been identified . [7] In one hypothesis, 
CNS auto -reactive lymphocytes are triggered outside the CNS, become active , and proliferate 
in th e peripheral secondary lymphoid organs. Upon migration via the blood circulation, the 
expression of adhesion molecules on the surface of these encephalitogenic lymphocytes permits 
adhesion to activated brain or spinal cord endothelial cells, with subsequent migration into the CNS compartment. These cells again proliferate upon interacting with CNS myelin antigens and initiate a pro -inflammatory cascade within the brain that results in either target -directed immune 
damage or bystander damage. Important cellu lar and humoral elements are T -and B -
lymphocytes, macrophages, microglial cells, and metalloproteinases, chemokines and cytokines, including interferon- gamma  (IFN γ) and tumor necrosis factor -alpha. [ 8-11] 
5.1.2 Clinical variants  
Four clinical forms of MS are recognized: primary progressive, progressive -relapsing, 
secondary progressive, and relapsing- remitting . [12] 
Patient s with relapsing -remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS ) have acute exacerbations or MS 
attacks with subsequent variable recovery (remission). At the onset of MS, 80% to 85% of patient s will have RRMS . In most cases of RRMS , Expanded Disability Status Scale  (EDSS) 
scores are below 4.  
Over the past few years m yelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein  (MOG) was shown to be  a disease 
entity distinct from classic MS and from Aquaporin 4 -IgG-positive neuromyelitis optica 
spectrum disorders , and which is now often referred to as MOG -associated encephalomyelitis. 
MOG- associated encephalomyelitis  is relevant not only for differences in clinical and 

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 43 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 paraclinical presentation, but more importantly also for treatment response and prognosis . 
[11,13,14]   
5.2 IMU -838  
5.2.1 Background 
Vidofludimus free acid (SC12267) was previously developed by 4SC AG using capsules or 
tablets containing amorphous vidofludimus (4SC -101). Immunic AG acquired all rights and 
data of SC12267 and has developed a new pharmaceutical form containing the calcium salt of vidofludimus (INNM: vidofludimus calcium) in a new  pharmaceutical formulation (tablets 
containing a specific polymorph).  
Both formulations depend on the same active moiety i.e. vidofludimus  which is released from 
the tablets in the gut and enters the blood stream. Hence, the 2 formulations share the same 
mechanism of action, pharmacology, and toxicology. Vidofludimus calcium may exhibit, however, superior pharmaceutical properties compared w ith the former vidofludimus free acid 
film- coated tablet.  
5.2.2 Mode of action 
The investigational medicinal product (IMP) IMU -838 ( vidofludimus calcium) is a new  
compound that selectively inhibits the human enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase 
(DHODH). As it is chemically and structurally different from t eriflunomide, a DHODH 
inhibitor approved in the United States of America (USA ) and European Union (EU) for the 
treatment of RRMS,  it also differs in the mode of DHODH inhibition.  
The mechanism of action in all therapeutic indications proposed for IMU -838 is the targeting  of 
lymphocytes, which are activated through the inflammatory process. Thus, IMU -838 selectively 
affects activated, rapidly proliferating lymphocytes through inhibition of DHODH, which plays 
a majo r role in the de- novo  pyrimidine synthesis and is specifically expressed at high levels in 
proliferating or activated lymphocytes. Resting lymphocytes satisfy their pyrimidine requirements through a DHODH -independent salvage pathway. The metabolic stress secondary 
to DHODH inhibition leads to a reduction of pro- inflammatory cytokine release including 
interleukin ( IL)-17 (IL -17A and IL -17F) and I FNγ, and to an increased apoptosis in activated 
lymphocytes. [15] IMU -838- mediated DHODH inhibition does not induce unselective 
immunosuppression and therefore offers to patients the selective targeting of dise ase-relevant 
effector cells.  
IMU -838 is further characterized by a short blood half- life of 30 -40 hours making it ideal for 
once- daily dosing and resulting in only little accumulation after daily dosing (steady state 

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 44 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 concentrations are reached within 4- 8 days with an accumulation factor of 2 ). Importantly  due 
to the short blood half -life, the wash -out period for IMU -838 is considerably short er than for 
teriflunomide.  
5.2.3 Non-clinical studies  
Pharmacodynamics  
Vidofludimus strongly inhibits  activated lymphocytes  and reduces  the release o f pro -
inflammatory cytokines  and other physiologic effects of activated lymphocytes  in in-vivo 
studies .  
The m etabolism  of vidofludimus involves primarily cytochrome P450 ( CYP )1A1 (about 60%), 
followed by CYP2C8 (about 20%) and CYP2E1 (about 10%). Vidofludimus  is primarily 
eliminated via feces (about 70%).  
Vidofludimus mildly to moderately inhibits several transport systems, including the ura te anion 
transporter 1 (URAT1), the breast cancer resistance protein  (BCRP) , the organic anion 
transporters (OAT) 1 and OAT3 , the organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) 1B1 and 
OATP 1B3, and the bile salt export pump . 
Consistent with the important role of DHODH for viral replication in human cells, vidofludimus 
inhibi ted viral replication of hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) in an in -vitro  assay.  
Inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation of v idofludimus was tested in vitro  on lymphocytes from 
mouse, rat and human. Vidofludimus is about 200- fold less active on rat lymphocytes, but a n 
about 10 times more potent inhibitor of activated human lymphocyte s than teriflunomide, the 
active metabolite of leflunomide.   
In a spinal cord extract -induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model in 
rats, v idofludimus showed dose -depen dent inhibition of EAE motor symptoms with a  strong  
and comparable effect at the doses 20 and 60 mg/kg. In addition, even the lowest dose of 
4 mg /kg reduced the weight loss caused by EAE.  
5.2.4 Clinical trials  
Except for  two Phase 1 trials  performed with IMU -838 and an ongoing Phase 2 trial in ulcerative 
colitis , all previous clinical trials  were performed using vidofludimus free acid (4SC -101). So 
far, no clinical trial s have been performed in MS. However, vidofludimus showed beneficial 
clinical effects in other autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases.  
Two clinical trials investigated  the beneficial effects of 4SC -101 in patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis  (RA) . 4SC -101 improved various clinical parameters versus  placebo.  A pronounced 
effect was observed for inflammatory parameters.  

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 45 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 In a small Phase 2 trial in patients with  corticosteroid -dependent inflammatory bowel disease 
(Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis), 4SC-101 showed beneficial effects in the remission 
mainte nance therapy. Compared with historical placebo data, 4SC -101 treatment showed a 
significantly higher response rate (88.5% total response)  as well as a corticosteroid  sparing 
effect .   
No 4SC-101- associated clinically significant adverse reactions were observed at doses of 
<70 mg once daily including the potential target organs liver and kidney as identified in 
non-clinical or early clinical trials . At higher 4SC -101 doses (>70  mg/day or single doses of 
210 mg) potential drug- related increases of red blood cells (RBC) in urine and hematurias were 
observed (see also Section  8.3).   
Two Phase 1 clinical trials were performed for calcium vidofludimus (IMU -838). In Trial 
P1-IMU -838-SAD, doses from 10 to 40 mg IMU -838 resulted in dose -linear blood 
pharmacokinetics ( PK) under fasted conditions. For the 30 mg dose (the dose expected to be 
closest to an effective dose), the terminal plasma half -life was approximately 40 hours and the 
median concentration peaked at 5 hours. Comparing single dosing of 10 mg under fasted and 
fed conditions, no detrimental effect of food intake was found. Single oral doses of 10 to 40 mg IMU -838 were well tolerated. No adverse events  of special interest (AESI; including hematuria 
or clinically significant RBC in urine high) were observed in that clinical trial.  
In Trial P1 -IMU -838- MAD, repeate d oral dosing of IMU -838 over 14 days in doses from 30 to 
50 mg resulted in dose -proportional blood PK under fasted conditions. Geometric mean half -life 
at steady state ranged from 28.6 to 30.4 hours. Overall, median peak concentration following multiple oral doses of IMU -838 occurred between 2 to 3 hours after the first and after repeat ed 
dosing. Steady -state levels were reached within about 4 days for 25 mg IMU -838, within 6 -8 
days for 30 mg, within about 6 days with 40 mg, and within about 8 da ys with 50 mg IMU -838. 
Repeated once -daily oral doses of 30 to 50 mg IMU -838 over 14 consecutive days were well 
tolerated. Mild or moderate treatment- emergent AEs ( TEAEs ) were reported by 31 subjects 
(59.6%); overall 53 TEAEs, reported by 29 subjects (55.8%) were considered drug -related. The 
number of subjects with  drug- related TEAEs or the number of drug- related TEAEs did not 
increase with increasing dose.  
Most  individual laboratory values were within the normal ranges. There were no clinically 
relevant differences between pre- and post -dose assessments and between the treatment groups 
for any parameter.

 5.2.5 Safety of IMU -838 
To date , 351 individuals have been exposed to vidofludimus. Of these 351 subjects, 299 were  
dosed with 4SC -101 and 52 with IMU -838.  
The safety analysis of all exposed subjects provided the following findings:  
• No deaths  
• No serious adverse event ( SAE ) during Phase 1 with IMU -838 
• The most frequent AEs for IMU -838 during Phase 1 were:  
o Headache  
o Flatulence  
o Common cold  
o Positive urine dipstick for hemoglobin 
Importantly, vidofludimus (free acid) at a daily dose of 35 mg showed no increase of adverse 
reactions  compared with placebo, and no increased infection rate.  
IMU -838 is a selective DHODH inhibitor and did not inhibit any kinase (of a panel of over 100 
tested protein kinases)  at blood concentrations that are  found at therapeutic dose levels.  
However, both teriflunomide and IMU -838 inhibit  organic anion transporters such as URAT1, 
which potentially co uld affect renal uric acid elimination.  
In conclusion, IMU -838 is expected to have a favorable safety  profile , as in more than 
350 patients (with rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease) or volunteers no 
increased events of diarrhea, nausea, alopecia or headache as well as no increases in abnormal 
liver function tests were observed.  
5.3 Rational e for the trial  
MS is a chronic disorder of the CNS, which affects up to 2.5 million people worldwide. Efficacy, 
safety and tolerability of the currently approved MS therapeutics are regarded to be substantially different among the available treatment options. As all these therapeutic agents have to be administered chronically, a high treatment adherence i s required, and therefore the need to 
increase the tolerability of the drug.   
Among the available disease modifying treatments (DMTs), oral administration is preferred by patient s with MS . One of the available DMTs for MS with oral administration is the D HODH 
inhibitor teriflunomide. In a Phase 2  trial of teriflunomide on patients with relapsing forms of 
MS, a statistically significant decrease in combined unique active ( CUA) lesions  was observed 
with teriflunomide compared to placebo after 1 2 week s of tre atment.   

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 47 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 As outlined above , IMU -838 selectively inhibits pyrimidine synthesis in activated cells  via 
inhibition of DHODH , which  seems to be a promising approach to treat  MS. Teriflunomide , 
currently approved in the USA and EU to treat RRMS,  showed consistent effects across multiple 
markers of MS burden and activity, including annual relapse rate (ARR) and risk of disability 
progression in several clinical trials. However , teriflunomide is associated with hepatotoxicity 
and clinically important AEs,  such as diarrhea, alopecia and neutropenia  which are thought to 
be off -target effects related to inhibition of certain kinases and which limit the use of 
teriflunomide in  patients with RRMS . Current data suggest that IMU -838 may show an 
improved safety an d tolerability profile compared with teriflunomide.  In addition, because 
teriflunomide has a prolonged half -life of 19  days in patients with MS, accelerated elimination 
with cholestyramine or charcoal may be considered when a treatment with teriflunomide m ust 
be terminated. The blood half -life of IMU -838 is roughly 30- 40 hours and therefore well suited 
for once daily oral administration and a quick wash-out after treatment discontinuation. 
Based on these data and the pharmacodynamics ( PD) of vidofludimus, IMU -838 may represent 
a novel and efficacious oral treatment option for RRMS  patients. Thus, trial P2-IMU -838- MS 
will evaluate the efficacy and safety of  2 different doses of IMU -838 in patients with RRMS .

 8 Trial  design and design rationale  
8.1 Overall trial design  
8.1.1 Design overview 
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double -blind , placebo- controlled trial in patients 
with RRMS and evidence of active disease. The trial comprises a screening period, a 24-week 
blinded main treatment  period  evaluat ing the efficacy  of 2 different doses of IMU -838 
compared with placebo, and an (initially blinded then open- label ) optional extended treatment 
period  for up to 9.5 years, during which patients receive 2 doses of IMU -838.  
Blinding to individual  treatment assignments during the main treatment period and during the 
beginning of the extended treatment period will be maintained for patients, investigators, and 
other personnel involved in the conduct  of this trial, until results of the data analysis of the main 
treatment period will be available. Once the results are known, the sponsor will unblind all 
involved personnel , except for the evaluating physician (see below)  by sending a summary 
report of the results . Depending on the results of the main treatment period, investigators may 
recommend  switching  to the other dose in agreement with the patient ( also see Section 8.1.4) . 
An overview of the design is shown in Figure 1.  
At each center , a 2-physician concept will be established i.e. at least 1 treating physician and at 
least 1 evaluating physician (and at least a deputy for each of the 2 physicians). The treating 
physician will be responsible for all aspects of the trial with the exception of neurological 
examinations which will be done by the e valuating physician . This 2 -physician concept ensures 
that the EDSS will be assessed blinded to other trial- related assessments (fo r details on the 2 -
physician concept refer to Section 10.2) .  
8.1.2 Screening  period and baseline MRI 
Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of RRMS and an MRI confirmation of at least one MS-
related  brain lesion in the last 6  months before informed consent will be included in the trial. 
Presence of active disease ( through presence of MS relapses in the past years ) and other 
eligibility criteria  will b e confirmed at Screening Visit 1 . For patients eligible for the trial  
following Visit 1 and after review of laboratory results , a baseline MRI will be performed 
(Screening Visit 2) that will serve as reference for further MRI assessments . The quality of th e 
baseline MRI, as well as the presence of Gd+ and T2 lesions will be evaluated centrally. The baseline MRI may be repeated once for each patient, in case of not acceptable imaging quality. Randomization must be performed within 14 days following the basel ine MRI (if the MRI 
assessment from the central reader is not available within these 14  days, randomization may be 
postponed by up to 7 days), and within 28 days (up to 35 days due to delay of the centralized 

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 53 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 assessment of baseline MRI; or up to 60  days if  the baseline MRI needs to be repeated for quality 
reasons) from Screening Visit 1. Randomization at the beginning of the main treatment period 
will be stratified by the number of Gd+ lesions (either 0 or ≥1 Gd+ lesions) and by the field 
strength of the MR I scanner used for trial MRI s (1.5T or 3.0T). 
If the baseline MRI will be repeated, patients must be randomized within 14 days of the repeated baseline MRI. I n this case, the Screening Visit 1 assessm ents will be valid for up to 60  days 
until the day of randomization, but will have to be repeated if 60 days are exceeded .  
8.1.3 Main treatment period  
On Day  0 of the main  treatment period , approximately 195 patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to 
once- daily oral treatment with 30  mg/day or 45 mg/day IMU -838, or placebo (about 65 patients 
each) for 24 weeks. For the first 7  days of the main treatment period, patients will only receive 
half the dose they were randomized to, i.e. 1 tablet of 15  mg/day or 22.5 mg/day IMU -838, or 
placebo. From Day 7 onwards, patients will receive the full dose, i.e. 2 tablets up until Week  24. 
Tablets (either 1 or 2) will always be taken at the same time  in the morning 15 to 60 minutes 
before breakfast  (please note that on visit days, the patient s should take their doses only after 
trough level blood collection  at the site) . During the main treatment period, symptomatic 
assessments (EDSS, clinical neurological symptoms, MRI), safety, biomarkers, and IMU -838 
plasma trough levels will be evaluated  (see Table  1 for details). The analysis of the main 
treatment period will be done after all patients completed the end -of-main treatment (EoMT) 
visit at Week  24.     
If the MR image of a patient shows ≥8  Gd+ per scan (investigator alert criterion) as assessed by 
the central MRI assessment the investigator will be informed. The requirement  and the nature 
of measures to be taken are at the investigator’s discretion.  
Patients who completed 24 weeks of main treatment and fulfilling further eligibility criteria (see Sections 9.2  and 1) , have the option to continue into the extended treatment period. 
8.1.4 Optional e xtended treatment period  
All patients who completed the main treatment period , who are eligible , and who chose the 
option to continue treatment will be re-randomized to the following treatment for the initial 
blinded weeks of the extended treatment period: 
• Patients who received placebo during the main treatment period will be randomized 1:1 to once- daily oral treatment with 30  mg/day or 45 mg/day IMU -838.  
• Patients who were  treated with  IMU -838 during the main treatment period  will be re-
randomized to the same dose they previously received. Patients, investigator and other 
trial personnel will remain blinded and unaware to this c ontinued treatment as these 

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 54 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 patients will undergo the same randomization procedures and IMP assignments as 
patients who previously received placebo. 
For the first 7  days of the extended treatment period, patients will receive half the dose, i.e. 
1 tablet o f 15 mg/day or 22.5 mg/day IMU -838. Thereafter and throughout the extended 
treatment period, patients will take 2 table ts of 15 mg/day or 22.5 m g/day IMU -838. Tablets 
(either 1 or 2) will always be taken at once in the morning 15 to 60  minutes before breakfast.   
For the initial weeks of the extended treatment period, trial participants, treating physicians, evaluating physicians, central MRI readers and all other personnel directly involved in the conduct of the trial will remain  blinded to all treatment assignments, until the results of the main 
treatment period are available. Once the results of the data analysis are available, the sponsor 
will provide summary results for all treatments of the main treatment period to the investigators . 
Investigators and patients currently in the extended treatment period will be unblinded  to the 
treatment assignments of the main and the past extended treatment period . From this moment 
forward, the treatment in the remaining extended treatment period will be open label.  
Depending on the results of the main treatment period, investigators may discuss the option of 
a dose switch for the remaining extended treatment period with  those patients still participating 
in the extended treatment period. D oses may be switched more  than once  during the extended 
treatment period but switching should always be done at a clinic visit.  
The decision of a dose switch  should be a personal decision based on patient -specific 
circumstances and treatment history with IMU -838. The investigator will discuss any potential 
risks of a dose switch (i.e. the disease management on the current dose and the potentially added 
risk of  switching to a higher dose). Patients will not be obliged to switch to another dose, even 
if the  higher dose showed beneficial effect s during the main treatment period. 
During the extended treatment period , the safety, clinical neurological symptoms, and EDSS  
will be regularly assessed at clinic visits scheduled every 12  weeks (see schedule of assessments 
in Table  1). The extended treatment period will end with the end-of- treatment (EoT) visit after 
9.5 years , unless the patient prematurely terminates the trial participation (for possible reasons 
see Section  17) or the sponsor terminates the trial (for reasons see Section  19).  
All patients discontinuing the trial as scheduled or prematurely will be encouraged to undergo an EoS vi sit 30  days (+14 days) after the last intake of IMP.  
8.2 Trial  design rationale  
This is a placebo -controlled , double -blind, randomized trial.  A placebo arm is included due to 
regulatory recommendations to evaluate efficacy  and adverse effects in randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled trials . [16] 

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 55 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 The distribution of male and female patients will be according to the natural distribution within 
the trial population, expecting more female than male patients.  No corrective measures will be 
taken.  
The trial uses a 2- physician concept , i.e. a treating physician and an evaluating physician for the 
EDSS, which ensures that neurological examinations will be assessed blinded to other 
trial-related assessments (for details refer to Section 10.2) . 
As this is a Phase 2 trial, the MRI based cumulative number of CUA lesions is considered an 
acceptable primary endpoint in line with the European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) Guideline on 
clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of MS . [16] As recommended, the 
quality of the baseline MRI images will be centrally assessed. The MRI evaluation will be done 
by a central reader blinded to all clinical information and to treatment assignments (besides trial center and patient number to ensure the correct comparison with previous MRI scans).  
Investigators will be provided with a detailed MRI Manual to ensure standardized MRI 
procedures.  
To mitigate any e thical concerns that may arise with the use of placebo in RRMS patient s, and 
in line with suggestions from the EMA guidelines, the period of treatment with placebo will be 
limited to 24 weeks. To reduce the number of patient s randomized to the placebo arm and to 
test 2 doses of IMU -838, a 3- arm design was chosen with 1:1:1 randomization, which will allow 
the treatment of twice the number of patient s with IMU -838 than with placebo. Additionally, an 
MRI investigator alert criterion has been defined in this protocol.  
The primary objective of this trial will be to compare the efficacy of 45  mg/day IMU -838 to 
placebo after 24 weeks of treatment. The schedule of MRI testing selected  is more frequent 
(every 6 weeks) than usually used in clinical routine , as Gd+ lesions offer the best evidence of 
recent inflammatory white matter lesions. Enhancement is consistently observed in those lesions 
in relapsing remitting disease and usually lasts 2  to 6 weeks. Therefore, the time period between 
MRI scans was chosen  to be  6 weeks to have the highest chance of capturing most or all Gd+ 
lesions.  
MRI testing is an accurate and reliable method. The choice of objective MRI -based endpoints 
will allow to reduce both sample size and trial duration, as opposed to a trial with clini cal 
endpoints only, which usually require a longer trial  duration. Typically, MRI trials have a 
duration of at least 6 months. In this trial, only one treatment arm will be treated for 24 weeks with placebo. At the end of this period, eligible patients will be allowed to participate in an 
optional extension period under active treatment, which will last up to an additional 9.5 years. 
Therefore, the overall maximum duration of this trial was chosen to be 516 weeks, to assess all patient s completing the blinded treatment period and (after unblinding) the open- label extended 
treatment period for long -term safety, tolerability and efficac y.

 8.3 Risk -benefit assessment  
Risks  
Based on pre -clinical and clinical studies  with the precursor drug 4SC -101 and the single and 
multiple dose P hase 1 studies with IMU -838, no serious adverse reactions  are expected with 
IMU -838 at doses of <70  mg once daily.  
In clinical studies  with 4SC -101, including 486 subjects of whom  299 received 4SC -101, no 
drug- associated clinicall y relevant adverse reactions were observed  at doses of <70  mg once 
daily . This included the potential target organs liver and kidney identified in animals or during 
early clinical trials . In a large p lacebo -controlled, randomized c linical trial of 4SC -101 in 
patients with RA , the AE profile of 35  mg/day 4SC-101 was similar to the AE profile of placebo. 
No increased rate of infections and infestations were  seen in the treatment arm as compared to 
placebo  in the same trial. 
At high 4SC-101 doses ( ≥70 mg/day or single doses of ≥ 210 mg) potential drug -related 
decreases in blood uric acid and increases in urine RBC were observed, in very rare cases 
presenting as symptomatic hematuria during the first days of treatment. Laboratory findings  
were consistent with post -renal events and de novo precipitates in the urinary tract.  However, 
no cases of sympt omatic hematuria were  seen at daily doses of 35 mg 4SC -101, the highest 
therapeutic dose used in previous clinical trials.  
Non-significant effects on serum u ric acid effects following 50 mg IMU -838 could be further 
reduced in a Phase 1 trial when subjects received half the dose i.e. 25 mg, during the first week 
of treatment confirming that the effect o n serum uric acid is a t reatment initiation effect. Pre -
dosing with low doses may therefore further limit the potential risk of AEs of the renal and 
urinary system, like elevated RBC levels in urine or hematuria.  
Based on these results, the underlying mechanism leading to increased RBC in urine appears to 
be an increased uric acid elimination during the initial days after drug administration. By 
inhibition of the urate transport system URAT1, IMU -838 may decrease the tubular re- uptake 
of uric acid in kidneys, leading to an increase in the urinary excretion of uric acid. Increased 
urine uric acid may in turn result in microcrystallization of uric acid in acidic urine and may lead to the occurrence of RBC in urine. Although this may not regularly lead to clinically 
relevant AEs or laboratory abnormalities at therapeutic doses, it may be important for patients with risk factors (including increased serum uric acid or higher propensity for urinary concrements) or in patients with a his tory of gout .  
Thus , several risk mitigation measure s for urinary events  were implemented in this trial: 
• Patients will be advised to drink sufficient fluid per day to ensure adequate urine flow.  

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 57 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 • Patients will receive only half of their assigned full dose during the first week of 
treatment as the main changes on uric acid urinary excretion are expected during the 
initial treatment days .  
• Regular urine dipsticks and urine sediment analysis will be performed to monitor 
presence of RBC in urine .  
• Patients with a history of renal diseases, especially those favoring or resulting in 
nephrolithiasis, with serum uri c acid levels at Screening Visit 1  >1.2 x  upper limit of 
normal (ULN) , and/or history of gout or symptoms suggestive of gout will be excluded 
from the trial. 
During clinical trials using the previous formulation 4SC -101, 1 SAE  of hepatitis was reported 
in a patient with Gilbert syndrome receiving 35 mg 4SC-101. Gilbert syndrome is  a genetic 
disease characterized by  a 70–80% reduction in the glucoronidation activity of UDP -
glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) . IMU -838 is a moderate inhibitor of UGT1A1 which 
may have contributed to this AE. Patients with known or suspected Gilbert syndrome or with 
elevation of indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin above 1.2 x ULN will therefore be excluded from this clinical trial. 
A thorough analysis of the clinical data did not confirm a potential adverse effect of 
vidofludimus  on liver function tests in patients other than those with Gilbert syndrome . 
However , patients with liver impairment or elevated liver functions tests (˃1.5 x ULN) will be 
excluded from trial participation and liver enzymes and bilirubin will be regularly monitored 
throughout the trial. For more information please refer to the investigator’s brochure.  
Benefits  
Vidofludimus  has so far been evaluated in about 230 patient s with RA and inflammatory bowel 
disease. A Phase 2 trial for ulcerative colitis  is currently ongoing, but results are not available 
yet.  
IMU -838 has currently not been tested for the treatment of RRMS. However beneficial effects 
are expected based on pre- clinical findings. In the  rat spinal cord extract -induced EAE model, 
treatment with IMU -838 inhibited motor symptoms and reduced EAE -associated weight loss. 
Further the DHODH inhibitor teriflunomide is already authorized for the treatment of RRMS 
and similar effects can be expected for IMU -838. However, IMU -838 appears to have severa l 
advantages compared to teriflunomide . IMU -838 is safe and can be easily managed by the 
treating physician for the following reasons:  
• The low intra - and inter -patient variation in IMU -838 plasma  trough levels reduce the 
risk of under - or over -dosing of patients compared with teriflunomide.  

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 58 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 • IMU -838 has a low risk of major safety issues compared with frequent side -effects 
observed with teriflunomide.  
• In case of  treatment termination , IMU -838 will be cleared from the body within a few 
days, whereas teriflunomide remains in the body for up to 2 years.  
Risk management  
Risk minimization procedures are  implemented for this  trial to minimize and assess potential 
risks to partic ipating patients. The se include, but are not limited to: 
• specific inclusion and exclusion criteria which ensure that patients who present with 
characteristics that may increase the risk for an adverse outcome are excluded , 
• close monitoring for RBC in urine, 
• regular m onitoring of liver enzymes   
• a 1-week initiation dose at half- dose level . 
Risk -benefit assessment  
Considering the safety data, the implemented risk minimization measures, the positive data in 
animal models of MS, the expected benefit s in the target population, and the medical n eed for 
further treatment in MS, the benefit-risk evaluation is considered favorable.

10 Randomization, blinding and unblinding procedures  
10.1 Blinding  
Trial participants, treating and evaluating physicians  (see below  for details ), central MRI readers 
and all other personnel directly involved in the conduct of the trial will be blinded to treatment 
assignments during the main  treatment period and for the initial time of the extended treatment 
period. The evaluating physician will also be blinded to any clinical outcome or treatment 
change. 
To maintain the blind, IMU -838 and placebo tablets will have identical appearance, shape and 
color, and will have identical labeling and packaging. To minimize the potential for bias, 
treatment randomization informatio n will be kept confidential by the responsible personnel and 
will not be released to investigators, other trial center personnel, or the sponsor ’s designee(s) 
during the main treatment period and the blinded phase of the extended treatment period .  
To maintain the blind during re -randomization for the extended treatment period, all patients 
will be randomized after Week  24 (see Section 10.6) , although patients already assigned to 
treatment with IMU -838 will be re -assigned to their previous treatment .  
The MRI evaluation will be blinded by means of the central MRI assessment procedure.  
Once the results of the main treatment period are available, treating  physicians, participants, and 
other involved personnel , except for the evaluating physician, will be unblinded. The evaluating

be re- assessed up to 30 days following the last treatment in the main treatment period . 

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 65 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 physician will remain blinded to patients’ clinical characteristics and treatment assignment 
during the entire clinical trial.  
10.2 Two-physician concept  
To achieve blinding for the evaluation of clinical endpoints, a 2- physician concept will be 
applied, consisting of a ‘treating physician’ and an ‘evaluating physician’. For each role, one deputy must be nominated. Therefore, in total a t least 4 staff members  have to  be involved in 
the treatment and evaluation of patients at each center. Throughout this protocol, references to the treating physician and evaluating physician include their respective deputies. 
The investigator responsible for the conduct of the trial and for supervision of the management 
of individual patients at the center should not take the role of evaluating physician. 
10.2.1 Treating physician 
The treating physician will be responsible for all aspects of treatment and clinica l management 
of the patient , including the management of relapses, and will have the same level of blinding 
as the patient. The treating physician will perform the following activities:  
• Physical examinations  
• Evaluation of the patient’s subjective findings  
• Assigning (through IWRS randomization) the IMP and monitoring the trial medication 
• Evaluating and managing (serious) AEs, concomitant medication, laboratory results, and 
relapses  
• Relapse assessment of concurrent fever or infection, assessment of EDSS criteria for a 
relapse based on the current and the previous EDSS scores 
The treating physician can never be involved in evaluating EDSS scores. 
10.2.2 Evaluating physician 
The evaluating physician will perform all standardized neurological examinations needed fo r 
the EDSS (see Section  13.3 and A- Table  1).  
Throughout the trial, the evaluating physician will not exchange any treatment -related 
information with the patient or with the treating physician, will not have access to the eCRFs, 
or to any source documents, and will have no access to any MRI scans or laboratory reports. For 
all data recordings, the evaluating physician will use hardcopies of the Neuro status tool forms 
(see Appendix 1), which will be forwarded to the treating physician after their completion for 
subsequent storage, both as hardcopies and through transcription of the data into the eCRF. 

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 66 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 The interaction with the patient  will be restricted to the neurological evaluation. The evaluating 
physician will not be allowed to talk with the pat ient about AEs, or any other issue that could 
potentially disclose the patient ’s treatment.  
Thus, the evaluating physician will be completely blinded to all aspects related to the patient ’s 
treatment.  
10.3 Patient’s identification card  
Patients will be provided with patient cards during their trial participation. The patient card 
allows the clinical trial patients to identify themselves as clinical trial participants, and thus ensures that health care providers (who are not  part of this trial) have access to the information 
about this participation that may be needed to determine the course of the pat ient’s medical 
treatment.  
This may include the possibility of emergency unblinding if needed. In case of an emergency the health care provider should first contact the respective clinical trial investigator, whose name 
will be given on the patient card (investigator must agree to this). If the investigator is available, 
he/she will answer any questions. Any subsequent action (e.g. unblinding) will follow the standard  processes established for the i nvestigators.  
10.4 Emergency unblinding  
The premature breaking of  the blind will be restricted to emergency cases in which knowledge 
of the administered drug is necessary for treatment of clinically significant AEs . Whenever 
possible, the investigator must contact the sponsor or the medical monitor before breaking the 
blind, and evaluate if the knowledge of the administered drug would have any impact on treatment decisions for the AE . If the blind is  broken, the respective patient will be withdrawn 
from further treatmen t in this trial and a written explanation must be given by the investigator  
to the s ponsor immediately. Emergency unblinding, if necessary, will be conducted via the 
IWRS of the eCRF.  
10.5 Patient  identification  
A 6-digit patie nt identifier consisting of 2 digits each for  country (YY), center (XX) and patient  
(ZZ) i.e. YYXX- ZZ will be assigned to each screened patient .  
10.6 Randomization  
The trial includes two randomizations , one randomization at the start of the main treatment 
period, and a second randomization at the start of the extended treatment period.  

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 67 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 Eligible patient s will be randomized by an IWRS  within the eCRF . The IWRS  will assign the 
IMP kits to each patient during the main treatment period and the blinded phase of the extended 
treatment period . The sites will be supplied with user guides for the IWRS  in English or the 
national language. 
Data on the presence or absence of Gd+ lesions needed to stratify the randomization in th e main 
treatment period, will be forwarded by the central MRI reader. In case this information is not 
available within 14 days after the baseline MRI, the randomization may be delayed by up to an additional 7 days. The center  will also use a dedicated single MRI machine for all trial -related 
MRI examinations, and the field strength of this MRI scanner (1.5 T esla vs  3.0 T esla) will also 
be used as stratification factor for randomization.  
The investigator s will be provided with technical options and password information to 
selectively break the code for an individual patient  via the IWRS or (as backup) telephone . For 
further information see Section  10.4.

Confidential   
 11.1.2 Placebo   
The placebo tablets will be identical to the IMU -838 tablets in terms of appearance, constitution 
of inactive ingredients, and packaging. 
11.1.3 Packaging, labeling  and dispensing  
All IMP  will be packed and label ed according to applicable regulatory requirements.  
The labels will contain at least the following information: route of ad ministration, trial code, 
randomization number, batch number , expiry date, and instructions for storage . 
IMU -838 and placebo tablets will be packaged in 30 mL polyethylene  bottles containing  
85 tablets.  
For the main treatment period, one bottle containing IMP will be dispensed at Day 0, then  
2 bottles each at Weeks 6, 12 and 18 (Visits 2 -4). For the extended treatment period, 3 bottles 
of IMP will be dispensed at Week  24/EoMT (Visit 5), and every 12 weeks (until EoT or until 
Week  504, whichever comes first).   
11.1.4 Storage and stability  
The investigator is responsible for the safe and proper handling and storage of the IMP at the 
investigational site. The IMP must be stored in a locked faci lity with access limited to the 
investigator and authorized personnel. The investigator must ensure that the IMP  is administered 
only to patient s enrolled in this trial. 
In stability studies, IMP  was stable at ambient (25°C/60% relative humidity ) and at accelerated 
storage conditions (40°C/75% relative humidity ), and does not require any special storage 
conditions. However, the tablets should be protected from direct sun light, moisture, freezing, 
and extended periods of excessive heat (defined as any temperature above 40°C [104 F]). It 
should also be advised to keep the bottle tightly closed to protect tablets from moisture.  
11.1.5 Treatment dose, dose selection , and administration  
The IMP will be administered once daily as oral tablets. Tablets (1 tablet per day for the initial 
week of treatment, 2 tablets per day thereafter) will be taken once daily in the morning in fasted state (no food after midnight, unrestricted intake of water is always allowed) and taken with one 
glass of water  approximately 15 minutes to 1 hour before breakfast.  If 2 tablets need to be taken, 
these will be taken at the same time.  
The following must be considered for IMP intake : 
• At all trial visit days  in the main treatment period , tablets must be taken  at the trial center 
to allow  for pre -dose assessments (i.e. plasma IMU -838 trough levels) . 

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 69 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 • During the entire trial, p atients will not be allowed  to have  breakfast before they arrive  
at the trial center  (to allow for blood chemistry) . Intake of water is always allowed  and 
will not be restricted.  
• The patient will be encouraged to drink sufficiently ( approximately  1.5 liters per day 
throughout the trial).  
Doses of 30 and 45 mg once daily were chosen based on 4SC -101 data where  a daily dose 
around 35 mg/day was safe, and based on the results of the P hase 1 studies with IMU -838 
showing comparable serum exposure of the free acid and calcium salt formulation of 
vidofludimus. Additionally, the Phase 1 trial of IMU -838 investigating multiple doses over a 
14-day period found doses of 30 to 50 mg IMU -838 to be safe. The highest dose used in this 
trial will be  45 mg/day IMU -838. The area under the concentration time curve of this  dose is 
expected  to be far lower than that of 70 mg/day 4SC-101, which was  associated with increased 
RBC in urine . To further reduce the risk of increased urine RBC, patients will receive only half 
the dose during the first week  of treatment as the mechanism of increased uric acid excretion is 
thought to be more pronounced during treatment initiation. 
An elimination half -life of 30 -40 hours allows a once daily administration with minimal 
accumulation (accumulation factor of 2). 
11.1.6 Drug accountability and patient  compliance  
The IMP  must not be used outside the context of this trial protocol. The investigator must ask 
the patient to return excess IMP  and all packaging  materials (including empty containers ) at all 
applicable visits ( see Table  1) for drug accountability. Unused IMP cannot be used outside the 
context of this trial protocol.  Dispensed and returned IMP cannot be re -used for any other 
patients.  
The investigator or authorized staff must  document the receipt, dispens ing, and return of all  IMP 
received during this trial. These records will include but are not limited to dates, quantities, 
batch numbers, pat ient identifiers , and unique interactive response technology  codes, as 
applicable . The investigators must maintain records documenting that patients were provided 
with the IMP  as outlined in the protocol. Furthermore, investigators will  reconcile all IMP  
received from the sponsor  and returned from the patient . It is the responsibility of the 
investigator to reason  any discrepancies in IMP accountability. Forms will be provided to ease  
accountability. 
At the end of the clinical trial, or as directed, all remaining and unused IMP  must be accurately 
counted (final drug accountability) and destroyed according to the sponsor ’s instructions,  i.e. to 
e.g. return all remaining and unused IMP to the sponsor or sponsor’s designee.

Confidential   
 11.2 Prior and concomitant medications  
All medications administered within 1  month before the day of informed consent and until EoS 
must be documented in the corresponding section of the eCRF. In addition, all MS-related  
therapies since MS  diagnosis will be documented in the eCRF. 
All medications taken by the patients after giving informed consent and all treatments  given in 
addition to the IMP during the trial are regarded as concomitant treatments  and must be 
documented in the eCRF. 
11.2.1 Permitted therapies  
11.2.1.1 Corticosteroid  treatment of MS relapses  
In case of MS -related neurological events, whether  or not  they meet the protocol’s clinical 
relapse criteria (Section 13.2), corticosteroid  treatment will be provided at the discretion of the 
investigator.  
It will be allowed to treat a clinical attack by a 3 to 5 -day course of methylprednisolone 500 to 
1000 mg/day intrav enous (i.v.) without tapering -out. 
Note: As corticosteroid  treatment may affect the results of MRI scans, specific restrictions will 
be applied with respect to timing of corticosteroid  treatment and planned MRI assessments (see 
Section 13.4 ). 
11.2.1.2 Plasma  exchange due to  MS relapses 
Only during the extended treatment period and only if with the corticosteroid treatment 
described above (Section 11.2.1.1) the patient remains non -responsive (and after assessing the 
risk-benefit ratio as well as treatment options outside of  the trial), plasma exchange is allowed 
for a total of 5 sessions within  2 weeks. 
If (in the assessment of the investigator) none of the above -mentioned rescue therapies 
(corticosteroid  treatment and plasma exchange) are sufficiently able to treat the MS relapse, the 
patient must be discontinued from the trial immediately and other treatment options outside this trial should be considered (see Section 17).  
11.2.1.3 Patient ’s self -medication  
As this is an out -patient trial, special care will be taken in questioning the patient s on any self -
medic ation. All concomitant medications taken by the patient during the trial from the date of 
signature of informed consent must be reported in the appropriate section of the eCRF along with dosage information,  dates of administration, and reasons for use. If the IMP  is discontinued, 
all remaining medications taken must be recorded in the eCRF until the end of the trial. The 

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 71 of 134

 following conditions should be particularly addressed, documenting the reasons why the  
concomitant medication was administered : 
• supportive therapy f or MS-related condition s (e.g. pain, fatigue or weakness, 
incoordination, bladder dysfunction, spasticity etc.)  
• medication and/or therapy for MS relapse  (as allowed in this trial)  
• for a medical condition already reported in the patient’s medical h istory (e.g. any form 
of pain, especially lumbar pain and headache, depression, etc.)  
• for prophylactic use  
• as treatment of an AE  
11.2.2 Prohibited medication  
The use of the following medication s and treatment s will be prohibited during the trial: 
• Monoclonal antibodies ( including, but not limited to natalizumab, alemtuzumab, 
daclizumab, ocrelizumab, anti -CD4, rituximab or belimumab, including their 
biosimilars)

• Vasopressin of vasopressin analogues 
• Rosuvastatin at daily doses higher than 10 mg 
• Live vaccines 
• Corticosteroid therapy  other than for MS -relapses, as defined above  (see Section 
11.2.1.1)  during the m ain treatment period ; during the extended treatment corticosteroid 
therapy will be allowed also to treat conditions other than M S relapses 
• Plasma exchange during the main treatment period; in the extended  treatment period it 
is allowed as defined above (se e Section  11.2.1.2 ) 
• Any other IMP  
Every treatment with oral or systemic corticosteroids must be reported. Furthermore, specific 
restrictions will be applied for the timing of MRI assessment relative to corticosteroid  treatment 
(see Section  13.4) . 
11.2.3 Restricted medications  
The c oncomitant administration of drugs metabolized for more than 70% by CYP2C8 (although 
not prohibited) should be carefully considered since it cannot be excluded tha t IMU -838 
potentially increases their blood levels. Major substrates of CYP2C8 include  
• amodiaquine (anti- malarial)  
• dasabuvir (anti -viral), enzalutamide (anti -cancer)  
• montelukast (anti -asthmatic), and 
• pioglitazone and repaglinide (anti- diabetics)  
In additi on, concomitant administration  of drugs  being intermediate or minor CYP2C8 
substrates (metabolized for 20 -70% or <20% by CYP2C8, respectively) known to have a 
clinically relevant association with impaired CYP2C8 functionality such as paclitaxel, chloroquine, loperamide, ibuprofen and possibly diclofe nac will also be considered with 
reasonable care. The use of these CYP2C8 substrates as concomitant medication is not 
prohibited during this trial. However, their use will be restricted in terms of dose and treatment 

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 73 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 duration (if possible), alternatives to  these drugs will be considered, and patients will be 
carefully monitored for any indication of toxicity. Given the narrow therapeutic window  of 
ibuprofen, the use of ibuprofen should be carefully considered or, if possible, therapeutic 
alternatives should be used. 
Care should be exercised when using me dications that are substrates of  the BCRP transport 
system , especially  where the elimination of the medication depends on the BCRP transport 
system. Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms  of excessive exposure to 
the medicinal products and dosing of these medicinal products should be carefully considered. 
This is partic ularly true for statins, and their dose should be lowered to the lowest possible dose. 
Specifically , doses of rosuvastatin are not to exceed 10 mg daily. 
11.3 Precautions and r estrictions  
Female patients:  
• must b e of non- child -bearing potential i.e. surgically sterilized (hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy at least 6 weeks before Screening Visit 1 ) or 
post-menopausal (where postmenopausal  is defined as no menses for 12 months without 
an alternative medical cause), or  
• if of child -bearing potential, must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening Visit  1 
(blood test) and before the first IMP intake (Day 0 urine test). They must agree not to 
attempt to become pregnant, must not donate ova, and must use a highly effective contraceptive method ( see below ) together with a barrier method between trial consent 
and 30 days after the last intake of the IMP . 
Highly effective forms of birth control are those with a failure rate less than 1% per year and include:  
o oral, intravaginal, or transdermal combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraceptives associated with inhibition of ovulation  
o oral, injectable, or implantable progestogen- only hormonal contraceptives 
associated with inhibition of ovulation  
o intrauterine device or intrauterine hormone -releasing system  
o bilateral tubal occlusion  
o vasectomized partner (i.e. the patient’s male partner underwent  effective surgical 
sterilization before the female patient entered the clinical trial and is the sole sexual partner of the female patient during the clinical trial)  
o sexual abstinence (acceptable only if it is the patient’s usual form of birth control/lifestyle choice ; periodic abstinence [e.g. calendar, ovulation, 

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 74 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal are no acceptable methods 
of contraception) 
Barrier methods of contraception include: 
o Condom  
o Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal 
gel/film/cream/suppository  
Male patients: 
• must agree not to fat her a child or to donate sperm starting at Screening Visit 1  and 
throughout the clinical trial and for 3 months after the last intake of the IMP .  
• must abstain from sexual intercourse with a female partner (acceptable only if it is the 
patient’s usual form of birth control/lifestyle choice), or  
• use adequate barrier contraception during treatment with the IMP  and for at least 
3 months after the last intake  of the IMP, and 
• if they have a pregnant partner, they must use condoms while taking the IMP to avoid 
exposure of the fetus to the IMP. 
If male patients do have a female partner of childbearing potential, the female partner must use a highly effective contraceptive or other effective  birth control method (see above) throughout 
the trial and for 30 days after the last intake of  the IMP.   
For restrictions concerning the administration  of the IMP  see Section  11.1.5. 
12 Trial  schedule  
12.1 Trial  conduct  
An overview of the trial conduct is provided in Table  1. Patients will be given a patient’s 
identification card at Screening Visit 1 stating the patient’s name, that the patient is participating 
in a clinical trial, and the name, address and telephone number of the investigator.  Patients must 
be advised to car ry this identification card at all times  during their participation in the trial (see 
also Section  10.3).  
Patients will be  advised to bring the IMP (including empt y bottles) to specified visits . At each 
visit, patients will be advised to drink a generous amount of fluid per day ( approximately 
1.5 liters per  day throughout the trial are recommended) to ensure adequate urine flow . 
Patients  will be asked to withhold IMP intake  on days of clinic visits, because they will take the 
IMP at the clinic  after all scheduled pre- dose assessments were completed . Patients will also be 

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 75 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 asked to fast overnight before all clinic visits as specified in Section 11.1.5, but not to restrict 
their water intake .  
Patient s will rest for at le ast 5  min before any blood is drawn (if applicable) or vital signs are 
measured.  
At all visits (except the EoS visit),  patients will be reminded to return to the trial site for their 
next scheduled visit (see Table  1). How ever, patients will also be instructed to contact the trial 
site at any time if they experience a pronounced deter ioration of their disease. P atient s must be 
advised to inform the inve stigator in case of any emergency.   
12.2 Screening   
Screening V isit 1 (Day -28 to Day -9) 
Patients for whom written informed consent (for consent procedures see Section 18.3) was 
obtained will undergo the assessments shown in Table  1. Patients will be screened for eligibility 
based on the trial’s inclusion and exclusion criteria. The presence of active MS will be confirmed 
based on the review of previous MRI (performed locally no longer than 6 months before the 
Screening V isit 1).  
Screening V isit 2  (Baseline MRI; Day -14 to Day -3) 
A baseline MRI will be performed to serve as reference for all future MRI assessments during 
the trial. The quality of the baseline MRI will be assessed centrally and may be repeated as soon 
as possible, if considered necessary by the independent MRI reader . If then acceptable, the 
repeated MRI will serv e as baseline MRI. The  screening period may be extended by the time 
from initial MRI to repeat MRI. However, randomization must occur within 14 days of the repeated MRI. Assessments from Screening Visit 1  will be valid for up to 60 days between 
Screening Visit  1 and randomization. If 60 days are exceeded, Screening  Visit 1- assessments 
must be repeated.   
Re-screening  
If the patient experiences a relapse during the screening period, the patient can be re -screened 
earliest 30 days after  the onset of the MS attack. 
12.3 Main treatment period  
Randomization visit (Visit 0 ; Day 0) 
Patients will undergo the assessments and procedures detailed in Table  1 and will be randomized 
to treatment with the IMP . Randomization must be performed within 14 days after the baseline 
MRI (if the baseline MRI was repeated, within 14  days of the repeated MRI) and within 28 days

Confidential   
 from obtaining informed consent. Blood samples for assessing IMU -838 trough levels will be 
collected before IMP intake.  
For female patients, the result of the local urine pregnancy test must be available and negative 
before the first IMP intake.   
Visits 1 to 4 (Day  7, Weeks 6, 12 and 18) 
Patients will undergo the assessments and procedures detailed in  Table  1. 
At each visit, blood samples will be taken pre -dose to assess IMU -838 trough levels. At Week  6, 
an additional  plasma sample will be taken  3 to 10 hours post -dose for assessing IMU -838 
population PK . Hence, the patient will be asked to remain at the trial site for at least 3  hours, or 
to return to the site 3 to 10 hours after IMP intake.  
In case of premature discontinuation during the main treatment period, patients will undergo all 
assessments sched uled for the EoMT visit (Table  1).  
Visit 5/EoMT ( Week  24) 
Patients will undergo the assessments and procedures detailed in Table  1 and, if they chose to 
continue into the optional extended treatment period, will be randomized for treatment in the 
extended treatment period . All patients who completed the assessments scheduled for this visit 
and fulfil the eligibility criteria for the extended treatment period have the option  to continue 
into the extended treatment period.  If the Week 24 MRI turns out to be not at least parti ally assessable it can be repeated as soon as 
possible. If the repeated MRI is still not at least partially assessable, the patient must be 
withdrawn from the extended treatment period. 
Patients prematurely discontinuing during the main treatment period will undergo the 
assessments scheduled for this visit (Table  1). 
12.4 Extended treatment period  
Visits 6 to 45 (Week  36 to Week 504; every 12 weeks)
10 
Patients will undergo the assessments and procedures shown  in Table  1. Patients will be 
assessed every 12 weeks during the extended treatment period.  
 
10 For patients in the Cohort 2 sub- trial the extended treatment period will be terminated the day the last patient 
of the Cohort 1 main trial has completed or discontinued the extended treatment period. The extended treatment 
period for Cohort 2 patients may thus be shorter.

 Visit 46/EoT (Week  516)11  
Patients will undergo the assessments and procedures shown in Table  1 and will be asked to 
return all remaining IMP and its packaging (including empty bottles) to the trial center for IMP 
accountability checks.  
Patients prematurely discontinuing during the extended treatment period will undergo the assessments scheduled for this visit  (Table  1). 
12.5 Unscheduled visit  
A patient may return for an unscheduled visit at the discretion of investigator to undergo 
additional safety evaluations (i.e.  laboratory re -testing, AE assessments), or for additional 
neurological evaluations, particularly in the case of neurological symptoms indicative of a 
potential MS relapse (see Section  13.2).    
The data from unscheduled visits will be collected in the eCRF.  
12.5.1 Unscheduled visit due to symptoms indicative for an MS relapse  
Patients who experience symptoms indicating a potential MS relapse ( in the absence of fever, 
as defined in Section  13.2)  will undergo the assessments of  an unscheduled visit as shown in 
Table  1. For allowed treatments of MS relapse, please refer to S ection 11.2.1. 
If the patient experiences fever, the unscheduled visit should be planned after fever has subsided and if neurological symptoms are still present.  
12.5.2 Unscheduled visit due to safety  
Patients wh o experience AE s of clinical relevance, i.e. AEs that in the investigator’s opinion 
require additional safety assessments, or require laboratory re -testing will undergo the 
assessments of an unscheduled visit as shown in Table  1. 
For follow -up of AEs including clinically relevant laboratory events please refer to 
Section  15.1.6. 
12.6 Premature termination  
If a patient prematurely discontinues the trial (for possible reasons,  please see Section  17)  
• during the main treatment period, i.e. before Week  24, all assessments scheduled for the 
EoMT visit should be performed; 
 
11 For patients in the Cohort 2 sub- trial the extended treatment period will be terminated the day the last patient 
of the Cohort 1 main trial has completed or discontinued the extended treatment period. The extended treatment 
period for Cohort 2 patients may thus be shorter .

Confidential   
 • during the extended treatment period, i.e. before Week 516,10 all assessments scheduled 
for the EoT visit should be performed. 
All patients  who prematurely discontinue the trial will be encouraged to complete the Eo MT or 
EoT visit, as described above , as well as the EoS assessments at 30  days (+14 days) after the 
last IMP intake.   
In case of premature withdrawal  from  the trial, reasons, circumstances and findings will be fully 
described on the corresponding page in the e CRF respecting the patient’s rights.  
12.7 End of study  visit (EoS ; 30 days +14 days after the EoT) 
Patients who discontinue the treatment  (at any time during the trial or as scheduled) will be 
asked to return for an EoS visit 30 days (+14 days) after their last IMP intake with assessments 
as shown in Table  1. For the follow -up of ongoing AEs at EoS, please refer to Section 15.1.6.  
For p atients who have had the  EoS visit  but who have still ongoing AEs which need to be 
followed up (see Section 15.1.6) and thus require  additional clinic visits, these visits should be 
documented as an unscheduled visit due to safety.  
13 Efficacy assessments and procedures  
13.1 Demographics an d other baseline assessments  
During Screening Visit 1, demographics (including sex, age, and race), a complete medical 
history including a detailed MS  history and previous therapy will be collected. A previous MRI 
scan (not older than 6 months) will be used to assess the eligibility.  
13.2 Neurological assessments and MS relapse  
MS clinical events occurring during any of the trial periods must be evaluated to determine whether they qualify as “MS relapse” as defined in this protocol for efficacy assessment.  
All of the following criteria must be met for a clinical event to qualify as a relapse:  
1. Neurological deficit, either newly appearing or re -appearing, with abnormality specified 
by both 
o Neurological abnormality separated by at least 30 days from onset of a preceding 
relapse  
AND  
o Neurological abnormality lasting for at least 24  hours 

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 79 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 2. Absence of fever or known infection (i.e. temperature [axillary, oral, or intra -auricular] 
≤37.5ºC) 
3. Neurological impairment, defined as either  
o Increase in at least  one of the functional systems of the EDSS  
OR 
o Increase of the total EDSS score.  
In both cases, the increase in EDSS must correlate with the patient’s reported 
symptoms. 
The occurrence of fatigue, mental symptoms, and/or vegetative symptoms without any additional symptom will not classify as a relapse (please see Section  15.1.7 if and when such 
symptoms must be recorded as an AE).  
To maintain blinding, the treating and evaluating physicians must fulfil different tasks in neurological and MS relapse assessments. Whereas the evaluating physician will perform the 
standardized EDSS assessment (as outlined in Section  13.3), the treating physician will assess 
neurological symptoms and confirm the presence of MS relapse based on all available data.  
At each scheduled visit, the treating physician will ask the pat ient if any new MS -related 
neurological symptoms have occurred. If the treating physician expects that a  protocol-defined 
MS relapse has occurred , the evaluating physician will be asked to do an EDSS assessment even 
if not plann ed according to the schedule of assessments. When the treating physician receive s 
the EDSS score,  he/she will also determine whether the EDSS criterion for an MS relapse is 
met. 
In-between scheduled visits, the patient will be instructed to contact the treating physician 
immediately if he/she develops new, recurring, or worsening neurological (including visual) 
symptoms. If symptoms indicative of an MS relapse are reported by the patient, the treating 
physician will assess whether the symptoms occur in the presence of fever or infecti on (in case 
of an unscheduled phone contact, the treating physician may simply ask the patient). 
If fever or infection is excluded, the evaluating physician must arrange for a neurological 
examination (assessment of EDSS) as soon as possible, at the latest  within 7 days following the 
reporting of the event. If fever or infection cannot be excluded, the neurological examination by the evaluating physician will have to be postponed until the fever or the infection has ceased 
(provided that the symptoms indica tive of an MS relapse are still present). Treatment of the MS 
event with corticosteroid s should not begin prior to the assessment by the evaluating physician. 
For allowed MS relapse treatments in this trial, please refer to Section  11.2.1. 

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 80 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 Based on the EDSS scores, in conjunction with the results from previous examinations, the 
treating physician will determine whether the EDSS criterion for an MS relapse is fulfilled.  
Since corticosteroid  treatment of MS relapses may affect the results of MRI scans, the 
occurrence of an MS relapse may result in the postponement of a scheduled MRI scan.  
Neurological symptoms characteristic of MS that are captured as new MS rel ated neurological 
symptoms in the E DSS and/or as MS relapse are efficacy measures and must generally not be 
documented as AEs. However neurological symptoms which are abnormally severe, not anticipated for the disease or are judged to be related to IMP tre atment must be reported as AE 
(for more details please refer to Section 15.1.7).  
13.3 Expanded Disability Status Scale  
The EDSS [ 17] is a widely used and validated i nstrument evaluating the functional systems of 
the CNS  to describe disease progression and the efficacy of MS therapy. The composite rating 
system rang es from 0 (normal neurological status)  to 10 (death due to MS) in 0.5- unit 
increments.  
The EDSS measures the impairment in 8 functional systems:  
• pyramidal - w eakness or difficulty moving limbs 
• cerebellar - ataxia, loss of coordination or tremor 
• brainstem - problems with  speech,  swallowing  and nystagmus 
• sensory - numbness or loss of sensations 
• bowel and bladder function 
• visual function 
• cerebral (or mental) functions 
• other 
Each functional system is scored independently. The combination of findings fr om the 
functional system scores allows to establish the final EDSS score.  
EDSS steps 1.0 to 4.5 refer to a functional status of patients  with MS with some limitations 
within at least one functional system, but still able to walk without any aid. EDSS steps 5.0 to 
9.5 are defined by the impairment to walk . Refer to  A-Table  1 (Appendix 1) for details on the 
EDSS scores.  The EDSS will be assessed by the evaluating physician  as scheduled in Table  1, and if possible, 
before any other assessments scheduled for that visit will be performed. To standardize the 
EDSS assessment, a paper -based Neurostatus tool set (provided by Neurostatus Syst ems AG, 
University Hospital Basel, Neurology, Switzerland) will be used  (see Appendix 1)  for the 

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 81 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 scoring of the impairment within each functional system based on which the EDSS scores will 
be automatically calculated upon data entry into the eCRF. 
To maximize data consistency, the same physician should perform the same assessments for a 
given patient at approximately the same time of day, whenever possible. The assessmen ts must 
be performed without consulting the results from previous visits.  
The Neurostatus tool should always be retained as a source document and the resulting scores 
(7 functional systems and 1 ambulatory) and final EDSS score be entered into the eCRF.   
To ensure consistency of EDSS scoring across all sites, investigators will receive a standardized 
manual on scoring EDSS using the Neurostatus  tool, which will be supplied to sites by the 
sponsor.  
All evaluating physicians should be familiar with the Neurostatus tool, however  no specific 
qualification level will be required. T he qualification level previously obtained by the evaluating 
physicians participating in this trial will be collected and documented. 
13.4 Magnetic resonance imaging  
MRI assessments will be performed before the treatment  with the IMP (baseline MRI , Section 
12.2)  and regularly during the main treatment period as scheduled in Table  1.  
For central assessment, it is of vital importance that all scans adhere to the standardized  MRI 
protocol (complying with the MRI manual) which will be provided separately. The  same 
dedicated MRI machine (field strength of ≥ 1.5 Tesla) will be used for all patients at each trial 
site. The only contrast agent s allowed in this trial are macrocyclic gadolinium- containing agents . 
Details on MRI protocol are described in the MRI Manual. 
The baseline MRI and all following scans during the main treatment period will be assessed 
centrally and no local assessments will be done for trial endpoints. No MRI finding wil l be 
communicated to the treating and evaluating investigators involved in this trial as they need to remain blinded to MRI scans results of  this trial (except for the inv estigator alert criteria as 
defined below).  However, the local site needs to assure that every MRI scan is reviewed for any 
unexpected non- MS findings that would be important for the patient’s health. Such important 
non-MS findings need to be communicated to the treating physician . 
A local previously taken MRI scan will only be used to confirm presence of MS -related brain 
MRI lesions , which is an inclusion criterion  (see Section  12.2 ).  
The treating physician at the site will only be informed about the results of the central MRI 
assessment if the investigator alert criterion was met (i.e. ≥8 Gd+ lesions, observed at a single 

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 82 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 post- treatment MRI scan performed at Weeks 6, 12, or 18) or in case of any  unexpected finding 
on the MRI likely not related to the underlying MS disease. 
MRI restriction rules  
To reduce the impact of corticosteroid  treatment on the MRI read -out, the following restrictions 
for the timing of MRI scans will be applied:  
1. No MRI scan is to be performed while a patient is receiving i.v. corticosteroid  therapy or 
for 30 days thereafter (counting from the date of treatment end).  
2. Whenever possible, any planned MRI scan should be performed before corticosteroid  
treatment is initia ted. Any post- randomization  MRI scan may be prematurely performed 
for up to 2 weeks if a corticosteroid  treatment needs to be initiated.  
3. No further MRI scan s will be performed until the following criteria has been met: 
a. If the baseline MRI scan at Screening Visit 2 (S2) cannot be performed due to 
corticosteroid  treatment  of a relaps e, the patient  may be fully re -screened earliest 
30 days after  the onset of the MS attack  (including all local and central laboratory 
assessment, and baseline MRI) .  
b. If any post-dose MRI scan after Day 0 cannot be performed due to corticosteroid  
treatment, the MRI scan for this timepoint will be postponed to fulfill the above mentioned criteria  of 30 days following end of corticosteroid  therapy. 
14 Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics , and health outcome  
assessments  
14.1 Pharmacokinetics  
IMU -838 plasma trough level concent rations will be determined by validated direct liquid 
chromatography tandem -mass spectrometry.  This method determines the concentration of the 
active moiety vidofludimus contained in IMU -838. Details of the assay will be described in a 
separate bioanalytical report.   
Plasma samples for IMU -838 trough levels will be assessed centrally at Nuvisan. Sa mples will 
be collected and subsequently stored at -20°C at the site, and shipped to the central laboratory 
as frozen sample s, as appropriate. Investigators will be provided with detailed written 
instructions how to collect, handle, store, and ship the samples.  
Plasma  trough levels of IMU -838  
Blood samples to assess IMU -838 serum trough values will be collected in all patients as 
specified in the schedule  of assessments during the main treatment period  (Table  1).  

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 83 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 Patients are required to withhold intake of the IMP  at each visit until  after the blood sample 
collection. If the patient inadvertently took the IMP  on those days, blood samples for trough 
levels will only be taken within 1.5 hours of IMP intake . If 1.5 hours are exceeded , no blood 
sample for trough levels will be collected.  Both  cases will  be recorded as protocol deviation s. 
Trough levels of IMU -838 (trough level quartiles) will be correlated with selected safety and 
efficacy variables.  
Population PK  
Blood samples for population PK will only be collected at Week  6 (Visit 2) pre-dose, and a 
second sample at 3 to 10 hours post dose.  
The first blood draw will be a trough level draw as on other study visits during the main 
treatment period.  15 minutes after patients have taken IMP, they are allowed to eat and drink.  
For the second post -dose blood sample on the same day, t he patient may remain at the trial 
center for at least 3 ho urs or leave the center and return to the trial center any time between 3 
and 10 hours of the morning blood draw. If feasible , these PK data will be evaluated (in 
combination with PK data from other trials) using a non -linear mixed effects modeling. A 
correlation with safety and efficacy may be evaluated if warranted by the data.  
Plasma PK samples will be stored at -20°C at the site until the next scheduled dry ice shipment 
to the central laboratory (see Table  1). 
14.2 Pharmacodynamics 
14.2.1 Neurofilament  
Neurofilaments light chain are an emerging serum biomarker for acute and chronic neuronal 
damage and will be assessed as detailed in  Table  1. Samples wi ll be centrally analyzed using 
Lab K it NFL.  
14.2.2 Peripheral blood mononuclear cell -based biomarkers  
Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) -based biomarkers will be assessed in a subset of 
patients only at selected Biomarker centers and will include lymphocyte subset analysis and  T-
cell clonal repertoire assessment  (see Table  1). The lymphocyte subset will be analyzed by 
immunophenotyping and flow cytometry. The T- cell clonal repertoire will be analyzed  by deep 
sequencing of T- cell receptors.  
PBMC- based biomarkers will be assessed centrally using Lab Kit PD.  

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 84 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 14.2.3 Blood genotyping 
At Day 0 before dosing, a single blood sample per patient will be  collected for genotyping. This  
includes assessment of gene and single nucleotide mutations for genes coding for metabolizing 
enzymes, transporter proteins, and for the target protein DHODH.  
Samples for genotyping (Lab Kit G) will be collected and stored at - 20°C at the center until the 
next scheduled dry ice shipment to the central laboratory for analysis. Investigators will be 
provided with detailed written instructions how to collect, handle, store, and ship the respective samples. Samples will be evaluated centrally.  
14.3 Health outcome assessment  
The patient rated outcome will be assessed based on answering questions of the Treatment 
Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication ( TSQM ).  
The TSQM is a reliable and valid instrument to assess patient s’ satisfaction with medication, 
providing scores on 4 scales: side effects, performance, convenience and global satisfaction . 
[18] Patient s will be asked to indicate their level of satisfaction with the treatment by answering 
the 14 questions of the TSQM (refer to Appendix 2)  as scheduled in  Table  1. Patients will 
complete the TSQM during respective clinic visits and results will then be transferred to the eCRF.  
15 Safety assessments 
15.1 Adverse events documentation and reporting  
15.1.1 Definition s 
15.1.1.1 Adverse events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the 
IMP, whether or not related to the IMP . 
Overdosing, defined as intake of more than twice the intended  dose, will not be considered an 
AE but must  be documented as protocol deviation. However, symptoms associated with 
overdose are considered adverse drug reactions (ADR, for definition see below).  

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 85 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 Untoward medical experiences occurring during pre -treatment periods do not meet the above -
mentioned definition of AE. Nevertheless, they have to be documented in the same way as AEs, 
if they occur in the safety monitoring period, i.e. between signing the informed consent form and completion of the EoS visit. Should they already be present at the Screening V isit 1 and 
don’t worsen later on, they will only be documented as medical history. 
A surgery or procedure scheduled to occur during the trial will not be considered an AE if the 
surgery or procedure will be performed for a pre -existing condition and the surgery or procedure 
was planned prior to trial entry. However, if the pre -existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly 
during the trial (e.g. surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the 
condition for which the surgery or procedure is being done will be considered an AE. Diagnostic medical or non -surgical procedures, including MRI will not be considered as AEs . 
Hospital admission for social or convenience reasons will also not be recorded as AE. AEs that occur between signing the informed consent form and the time when the patient first 
administers the IMP (Day 0) are defined as pre -treatment AEs.  
Treatment -emergent adverse events are defined as any event not present prior to the first 
intake of IMP  or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency 
following exposure to the IMP . 
A continuous event with changing intensities will be considered as one event of the most severe 
intensity documented. A continuous event with a changing seriousness will also be considered  
as one event, but the start and stop date of the time the event is serious must be separately 
documented. Clearly separated episodes of an event will be considered as separate events.  
For AESI s see Section  15.1.3. 
15.1.1.2 Adverse drug reactions and unexpected adverse drug reactions  
All adverse events judged by either the reporting investigator or the sponsor as having a reasonable causal relationship to the IMP qualify as ADR. The expression reasonable causal relationship means to convey in general that there is evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship.  
An unexpected ADR is an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product information (e.g. investigator’s b rochure for an unapproved 
investigational product or package insert or summary of product characteristics for an approved product). Reports that add significant information on specificity or severity of a known, already 
documented AE constitute unexpected AEs, too. For example, an event more specific or more severe than described in the reference document would be considered ‘unexpected’. Specific 

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 86 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 examples would be: acute renal failure as a labeled AE with a subsequent new report of 
interstitial nephritis or hepatitis with a subsequent report of a utoimmune hepatitis . 
15.1.1.3 Serious adverse events  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: 
• results in death  
• is life-threatening 
• requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
NOTE: The term "life -threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an event in which the 
patient  was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. 
Medical and scientific judgment will be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardi ze the patient or may 
require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These will usually also be considered serious. 
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  In addition, new malignancies that occur during 
the participation in the  trial are defined as important medical events and must be reported as 
SAE s.  
An SAE requires that the underlying event is considered an AE as defined in Section 15.1.1.1. 
Hospitalizations due to a surgery or procedure during the trial will not be considered an SAE if 
the surgery or procedure will be performed for a pre -existing condition and the surgery or 
procedure was planned prior to trial entry. However, if the pre -exis ting condition deteriorates 
unexpectedly during the trial (e.g. surgery performed earlier than planned), then the 
deterioration of the condition leading to hospitalization will be considered an SAE. Hospital admission for social or convenience reasons will not be recorded as SAE. 
15.1.1.4 Suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction  
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR)  is a serious adverse reaction 
(SAR) that is unexpected or for which the development is uncommonly (unexpected issue) 

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 87 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 observed du ring a clinical trial and for which there is at least a reasonable possibility of a causal 
relationship with the IMP . 
15.1.2 Classification of adverse events  
Classification of AEs will be performed by the investigator.  
Causality  
The causal relationship between the AE and the administration of the IMP or trial procedure 
will be assessed as follows:  
• Related:  Implies a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the 
event and the IMP or procedure . This means that there are facts 
(evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.  
• Not 
related:  Implies no reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the 
event and the IMP  or procedure . This means that there are neither facts 
(evidence) nor arguments to suggest a causal relationship.  
Severity  
Severity is a clinical observation and describes the intensity of the event.  
• Mild:  Any symptom, of which the patient is aware, but which is easily tolerated  
• Moderate:  Any symptom, which is discomforting enough to cause interference with 
a patient’s usual activity  
• Severe:  Any symptom, which causes a patient’s inability to perform usual 
activity  
For the sever ity classification of hematuria  see Section 15.1.3.  
Outcome c ategories  
Recovered:  The patient  has fully recovered from the event or the condition has 
returned to the level observed at B aseline  
Recovering:  The patient has recovered from the event, but the condition has not 
returned to the level observed at Baseline; 
Not recovered:  The event is ongoing at the time of reporting and the patient  has 
still not recovered  
Recovered  
with sequelae: As a result of the AE, the patient  suffered persistent and significant 
disability/incapacity (e.g. became blind, deaf or paralyzed) 

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 88 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 Fatal:  The patient  died due to the event. If the patient died due to other 
circumstances than the event, the outcome should be stated 
otherwise (e.g. not recovered or recovering) 
Unknown:  If the outcome is not known or not reported 
15.1.3 Adverse events of special interest  
The following AEs are de fined as AESI s, if these events are different from any pre -existing 
conditions or a result from known conditions: 
• RBC urine positive (as defined below), at least of moderate intensity  
• Hematuria (as defined below ) 
• Retroperitoneal colicky pain with suspected or confirmed nephrolithiasis  
Evaluation and assessments of RBC in urine  
The e valuation of RBC in urine will be solely based on findings from microscopic examination s 
of urinary sediment and not from dipstick reading only. [ 19] Therefore all conspicuous dipstick 
readings will be followed up by a microscopic examination of urinary sediment. All findings of 
RBC in urine per high -powered field (HPF) will be listed as urinalysis abnormalities but not as 
an AE , if assessed by the investigator as not clinically significant. The investigator will also 
assess any increased RBC in urine as not clinically significant , if there are more likely  
alternatives to explain this finding. The followi ng alternat ive explanations of RBC in urine high 
will be considered:  
• The urine sample was not properly collected (random midstream clean -catch collection) 
or evidence of contamination (e.g. presence of bacteria or an unusual number of 
epithelial cells in urine sediment not explained by other conditions).  
• Evidence of infection not considered secondary to a drug- induced damage.  
• Likely benign causes, such as menstruation, vigorous exercise, viral illness, trauma, and 
infection.  
If any finding of “ RBC in urine high ” is assessed by the investigator as clinically significant, 
this finding will be reported as the AE “RBC urine positive” .  
Evaluation and assessment of hematuria  
Any occurrence of RBC urine posit ive will only be defined as the AE “hematuria ” if at least one 
of the following 2 conditions are met:  
• ≥5 RBCs per HPF  were found in at least 2 consecutive, properly collected urinalysis 
specimens,  [20] and/ or

Confidential   
 • the finding of RBC urine positive had diagnostic or therapeutic consequences. 
Severity assessment of hematuria  
Severity is a clinical observation and describes the intensity of the event.  The severity of 
hematuria  is classified as follows:  
• Mild:  Asymptomatic hematuria; clinical or diagnostic observations only  
• Moderate:  Symptomatic hematuria; e.g. with moderate flank pain (and including 
short- term*, standard -dose therapy with oral nonsteroidal anti -
inflammatory drugs, oral acetaminophen or oral aspirin), interfering with 
but not limiting activities of daily living  
• Severe:  Gross or macrohematuria 
Any hematuria with severe flank pain limiting activities of daily living . 
Any hematuria  requiring additional treatment (e.g. oral anti -emetics or 
muscle relaxants, around the clock narcotic analgesics, use of narcotics or 
any intravenous treatment) or procedures for maintaining adequate urinary flow (e.g. urinary catheter or bladder irrigation). 
* For less than 24 hours.  
15.1.4 Documentation of adverse events 
All AEs occurring between the date written  informed consent was obtained and 30 days after 
the patient’s last IMP intake  (observation period) must be recorded. Information on AEs will be 
derived by non -directive questioning of the patients in  general terms at each visit (e.g.  "How do 
you feel?” or “How have you been since the last questioning?"), by patients’ spontaneous reports, or by observation. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered by the patient d uring or between visits or through physical examination, laboratory test, or other 
assessments.  
All AEs that occur during the observation period of the trial as described above will be recorded 
in the patient’s AE section of the eCRF and will include the following i nformation: a description  
of the AE, date of onset and resolution, severity, relationship to the IMP, relationship to trial  
procedure, action taken, and outcome. For SAEs, the SAE form must be completed (see Section 
15.1.5).  
15.1.5 Documentation and reporting of immediately reportable adverse events 
Any AESI  (see Section  15.1.3) , any unexpected AE that could adversely affect the safety of the 
patient  or the conduct of the trial, and any SAE  that occurs during this trial will be reported (via 
the "Adverse Event of Special Interest Form" or the "Serious Adverse Event Form") to the

 sponsor immediately (i.e.  within 24 hours). The information will include at least the following 
data:  
• Name, address, and telephone number of the reporting investi gator  
• Investigational product(s)  
• Trial code  
• Patient  identification number, sex, and date of birth  
• Description of the AE, measures taken and outcome (at the time of reporting)

The sponsor ensures that all relevant information about SUSARs that are fatal or life threatening 
is recorded. Reporting of SUSARs to the independent ethics committee (IEC) and regulatory 
authorities will follow pertinent national legislation.  
The sponsor will inform as soon as possible and following national pertinent national legisla tion 
the regulatory authorities  and the IECs about any event that  necessitates reconsideration of the 
benefit -risk-ratio of the IMP . These events are in particular:  
• single cases of expected SARs  with an unexpected outcome,  
• an increased incidence of expected SARs  considered clinically significant , 
• SUSARs occurring after a concerned person has completed the trial,  
• events related to the conduct of the trial or the development of the tested IMP possibly 
affecting the safety of the concerned persons.  
All additional measures deemed necessary through new findings and taken by t he sponsor or 
the investigator to protect the safety of the persons concerned and their triggering circumstances will be reported as soon as possible to the c oncerned regulatory authorities  and the IECs, if 
applicable.  
Periodic safety  reporting to regulato ry authorities  and the IECs will follow pertinent national 
legislation.

Confidential   
 In the event of a fatality, the " Trial participant’s insurer" will be informed by the sponsor’s 
designee  within 24 hours of gaining knowledge of the event . In case of other SAEs, the " Trial 
participant’s  insurer" will be  informed promptly.  
15.1.6 Follow -up of adverse events  
All SAEs judged to be related to the IMP must be followed by the investigator until the patient  
has recovered, recovered with sequelae, died, or until the investigator determines that the 
patient ’s condition is stable, whichever occurs first. All other AEs must be followed by the 
investigator until the conditions mentioned above are met or until the  EoS visit  (30 days after 
the last IMP intake), whichever comes first, and until all AE -related queries for the patient have 
been resolved.  The investigator will take all appropriate and necessary therapeutic measures 
required for resolution of the AE, if applicable. All efforts to collect follow -up information must 
be documented in the source data.  
Follow -up information should be supplied on the respective forms of the eCRF.  
During and following a patient’s participation in this trial, the investigator must  ensure that 
adequate medical care is p rovided to a patient for any AEs related to the trial, including clinicall y 
significant laboratory values . 
15.1.7 Handling of events typical for MS  
The disease characteristics, in particular those neurological symptoms that are characteristic for 
MS and neurological functional systems scores during the EDSS assessment, will be regularly captured throughout the trial and are classified as efficacy assessments. For this reason, any MS -
related symptoms should not be collected as AE, if any one of the following criteria applies:  
• These MS -related symptoms were already present at Screening (and their fluctuations in 
pattern and intensity throughout the trial are considered anticipated based on the individual patient’s disease history), or 
• These MS -related symptoms had already occurred during the disease history of the 
patient prior to the trial and their pattern and intensity during the course of the c linical 
trial is consistent with the individual course of the disease, or  
• These MS -symptoms are in close temporal correlation to an acute exacerbation of MS 
in this patient and (in the assessment of the investigator) have a clear relationship to this exacerbation event and have an anticipated intensity for such exacerbation event.  
The terms “MS relapse”, “MS attack”, “ MS exacerbation” or “worsening of MS” will not be 
considered as AEs, since MS r elapse or worsening of EDSS score will be collected as efficacy 
parameters in this trial.  

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 92 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 However, neurological symptoms should be collected as an AE (even if those symptoms are 
characteristic for patients with MS), if any of the following conditions  applies : 
• Any new or worsened neurological symptom  if its  course is abnormally severe or 
abnormal in its temporal pattern (even if any of the above -mentioned criteria for an 
exclusion from AE collection applies), or  
• Any new neurological symptom that does not have a close temporal relationship to an exacerbation even t and (in the assessment of the investigator) is not anticipated for the 
course of the disease, or  
• Any new neurological symptoms that (in the assessment of the investigator) is correlated 
to start or change of IMP  in this trial.  
Only those neurological sym ptoms which qualify as AEs according to the definition above may 
potentially be reportable as SAEs. In these cases, the seriousness criterion (e.g. hospitalization) 
must be assessed and an SAE report completed and sent to the sponsor.  
The terms “MS relapse”, “MS attack”, “ MS exacerbation”, “worsening of MS” or other MS -
related symptoms which should not be collected as AEs according to the description above, can per definition not qualify as SAE, even if they fulfill a seriousness criterion such as 
hospital ization. 
15.1.8 Pregnancies  
Should a pregnancy occur in a female patient, or in a female partner of a male patient, it must 
be reported to the sponsor within 24  hours of the first awareness of the event and be recorded 
on the appropriate pregnancy form. The trial  participation of p atients who become pregnant 
during the trial after signing the informed consent will be  discontinue d immediately.  
A pregnancy is not regarded an AE unless there is a suspicion that the IMP  may have interfered 
with the effectiveness of a contraceptive method. Whenever possible, the outcome of all 
pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or congenital 
abnormality, maternal and/or new -born complications) must be followed up and documented 
even if the patient w as discontinued from the trial . All reports of congenital abnormalities or 
birth defects are SAEs. Spontaneous miscarriages will also be reported and handled as SAEs. 
Elective abortions without complications will not be handled as AEs. 
Pregnancy follow -up will be recorded on the pregnancy form and will include an assessment of 
the possible relationship of the IMP to any pregnancy outcome.

Confidential   
 15.2 Laboratory investigations 
Clinical laboratory tests will be performed  at the times indicated in the schedule of assessments 
(Table  1).  
All laboratory samples must be clearly and fully labeled  according to the central laboratory 
manual. The laboratory reports received from the central laboratory via email or fax  will be 
printed, reviewed, signed, and dated by the investigator, and filed at the center. The laboratory 
results will be additionally  imported into the eCRF.   
Abnormal results will be assessed by the investigator and classified as clinically significant (yes/no). Clinically significantly abnormal values must be reported as AE, if not already clinically significantly abnormal at Baseline  (i.e. pre -dose on Day 0) or Screening Visit  1 or if 
there are known circumstances unrelated to a disease or the medication (such as patient activities or sample handling) that are a likely explanation s for the abnormal value . 
Persistent clinically signifi cant abnormal values must be followed up using local laboratory 
values until the cause is determined or until they return ed to normal or to the level observed at 
Baseline (for follow -up of clinically significant laboratory values reported as AEs , see Secti on 
15.1.6) . 
15.2.1 Pregnancy tests  
Female patients of childbearing potential, i.e. not postmenopausal ( where postmenopausal state 
is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause) or not surgically sterile, must have a negative pregnancy test before the first intake of  the IMP. A blood pregnancy 
test is required at Screening Visit  1. Any local urine pregnancy test that shows a positive re sult 
must be followed up with a confirmatory local blood pregnancy test. 
Additional urine pregnancy test ing will be performed locally as scheduled in Table  1 for all 
female patients of childbearing potential.  For follow -up procedures in case of pregnancy see  
Section  15.1.8. 
15.2.2 Blood chemistry, hematology, and coagulation 
15.2.2.1 Assessments 
Blood chemistry, hematology and coagulation assessments will be performed using Lab Kits A, 
B and C as scheduled in Table  1. The following parameters will be tested : 
Lab Kits A and B  
• Hematology: Erythrocytes, leucocytes, differential leucocyte count (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes),

  international normalized ratio  (INR)   
Lab Kit C 
• Hematology: Erythrocytes, leucocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, MCH, platelets  
• Biochemistry: Liver function monitoring: AST, ALT, AP, GGT, tot al 
bilirubin, unconjugated (indirect)  and conjugated (direct) 
bilirubin.  Renal function monitoring : creatinine, uric acid, BUN. eGFR 
clearance will be calculated according to the CKD- EPI equation. 
Other parameters:  Na, K, Cl, P, Ca, CRP, total protein, amylase, 
lipase, albumin, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol 
Blood chemistry, hematology, and coagulation analyses will be done centrally  (see Section  6). 
Abnormal results will be classified as clinically significant (yes/no). Clinically significantly abnormal values , which were not clinically significantly abnormal at Baseline,  must be repor ted 
as AE.  
Blood samples will be collected, handled and stored according to the instructions provided by 
the central laboratory. Coagulation samples will be collected and stored at -20°C at the site  until 
the next scheduled shipment to the central laboratory for analysis . Dry ice shipments  may be 
delayed for up to 2 weeks if another patient is expected to finish the respective visit.

Confidential   
 Samples collected at Baseline, stored but not used for the primary analysis  (“B-sample”) , may 
be used in future research to evaluate other serum markers (e.g. Epstein -Barr Virus) and address 
research questions that may arise after trial completion.  
15.2.2.2 Monitoring of hepatotoxicity  
Patients will be monitored throughout the trial for evidence of hepatotoxicity with regular 
assessments (every 6  weeks during the main treatment period and every 12 weeks during the 
extended treatment period) of liver enzymes e.g. AST , ALT, AP , GGT and tot al and indirect 
bilirubin. In addition, the exploratory biomarker Micro ribonucleic acid -122 ( miR-122) of drug-
induced liver injury will be assessed pre- dose and at 4  hours after the first dose of the IMP in 
the main treatment period.  
In case of an increase in ALT, GGT or AST to >3 x ULN, or indirect or total bilirubin >2  x ULN 
during dosing with the IMP, testing of all liver parameters (ALT, AST, GGT, total and indirect 
bilirubin) will be repeated as soon as possible  (to be documented as unscheduled visit  due to 
safety) . Patients will also be asked about symptoms. Concomitant medication will be checked 
for hepatotoxic medications and possible drug-drug interactions. 
If repeat testing still shows ALT or AST to be >3  x ULN, or bilirubin >2  x ULN close 
monito ring of the respective patient will be initiated (including but not limited to repeating liver 
enzymes and serum bilirubin tests 2 or 3 times weekly, detailed evaluation of medical history 
and concomitant drug use, ruling out any other cause of liver enzym e increases, and further liver 
function tests as considered appropriate by the investigator). 
Treatment with the IMP will be discontinued if at least one of the following applies 
(hepatoxicity- related stopping rules):  
• ALT or AST >8  x ULN  
• ALT or AST >5  x UL N for more than 2  weeks 
• ALT or AST >3  x ULN , and total bilirubin >2  x ULN or INR >1.5 x ULN 
• ALT or AST >3  x ULN with appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia 
• Indirect bilirubin >3 x ULN  
15.2.3 Urinalysis  
15.2.3.1 Assessments 
Urine assessments will be performed using Lab Kits A, B, and C as scheduled in Table  1, 
including the following parameters:

• pH, nitrites, hemoglobin, protein, albumin, glucose, ketones , uric acid, creatinine  
• microscopic examination of the urine sediment: RBC, w hite blood cells, epithelial cells, 
bacteria, casts, crystals (including identification of crystals, if possible)  
Lab Kit C 
• pH, nitrites, hemoglobin, protein, albumin, glucose, ketones, uric acid, creatinine 
• a dipstick analysis, including the assessment of  RBC in urine, performed and read  
centrally12 
• if the dipstick is positive for RBC in urine, a urine sediment analysis will be performed: 
RBC, white blood cells, epithelial cells, bacteria, casts, crystals (including identification 
of crystals, if possible)  
Urinalysis will be done centrally (see Section 6). Abnormal results will be classified as clinically 
significant (yes/no). Clinically significantly abnormal values must be reported as AE , if not 
already clinically significantly abnormal at Baseline.  
The handling and collection  of urine samples will be detailed in the Laboratory Manual. 
15.2.3.2 Monitoring of red blood cells in urine  
Urinalysis for presence of RBC in urine (microscopic examination of urinary sediment) will be regularly assessed throughout the main treatment period. Urinary screening during the extended treatment period will be performed with urine dipstick assessments for RBC in urine. A positive dipstick assessment will trigger a full urine sediment analysis. In addition, plasma uric acid will be regularly monitored throughout the entire trial. Assessment of RBC in urine and hematuria as laboratory abnormality and/or AE should be based solely on findings from the microscopic examination of urinary sediment and not on dipstick readings only. [ 19]
  For further information 
see Section  15.1.3. 
15.2.4 miR-122 expression  and John Cunningham virus DNA  
The biomarker miR -122 is an early indicator of drug- induced liver injury. At Day 0, before 
dosing and 4 hours after dosing, a blood sample pe r patient will be collected for miR -122 
expression. Samples will be centrally analyzed using Lab Kit BM.  Samples for miR -122 
quantification will be collected and stored at -20°C at the site until the next scheduled dry ice 
shipment to the central laboratory for analysis.  Dry ice shipments may be delayed for up to 
2 weeks if another patient is expected to finish the respective visit.  
 
12 The dipstick as well as the urine sample (to be included  for potential urine sediment analysis) will be shipped 
to the central laboratory.

 Detection of urinary JCV -DNA: at time points given in Table  1, urine samples will be used to 
determine whether the patient is an active secretor of the JCV -DNA in urine, and if this secretion 
is influenced by administration of IMU -838. Samples will be centrally analyzed using Lab Kit 
JCV.  
Investigators will be provided with detailed written instructions how to collect, handle, store, 
and ship the respective samples.  
15.2.5 Serology  
Tests for HBsAg, HBcAb, HCV- Ab, and HIV -Ag/Ab combined test, and a Mycobacteriu m 
tuberculosis  IFNγ-release assay ( Tbc-IGRA) will be performed during Screening Visit 1. The 
HBcAb assay will be a combined IgG and IgM test. In case of a positive result, IgM will be 
evaluated separately.   
A positive HIV -Ag/Ab test will  be followed up by further HIV testing based on Nucleic Acid 
Amplification Technology. A patient will only be considered HIV positive, and must be 
excluded from the trial, when both tests are positive.  
The Tbc -IGRA will be done locally , all other Screening Visit 1 tests will be done centrally  using 
Lab Kit S . 
15.2.6 Screening laboratory 
The screening laboratory tests include :  
• Blood pregnancy test 
• Hematology and blood biochemistry: Neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets, serum 
creatinine, ALT , AST, and GGT, total, direct and indirect bilirubin, uric acid , eGFR

Confidential   
 Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), and pulse must be measured with the patient in a seated 
position, after at least 5 minutes at rest.  
Change s in vital sign s judged by the i nvestigator as  clinically significant will be reported  as an 
AE. 
Physical examination  
Physic al examinations will cover the following body systems: general appearance, skin, neck 
(including thyroid), throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, back, lymph nodes, extremities, vascular, neurological systems, and, if applicable, others.  
Any new clinically signif icant  finding compared to Screening Visit 1  must be documented as 
AE. 
Any clinically significant finding at Screening Visit  1 must be documented in the medical 
history section of the eCRF.  
12-lead electrocardiogram  
The 12- lead ECG (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aV F, V
1-V6) will be re corded in supine position after  at 
least 5  minutes at  rest using the local  standard ECG machine . The ECG will be analyzed 
qualitatively (normal or abnormal, if a bnormal clinically significant [yes/no]). The heart rate, 
PQ-, QRS -, and QT -intervals, as well as the heart rate- corrected QT c interval (according to 
Bazett’s formula) will be determined. All  procedure s will be done according to local practice.  
Any findings from ECGs collected after the IMP  administration will be captured as AE s if, in 
the opinion of the investigator, there was a clinically  significant  change from Screening Visit  1. 
15.4 Steering committee  
A steering committee will provide advice on the conduct of the trial, the review of safety data 
and for publications  of trial results . The steering committee will include at least 5 members: the 
coordinating investigator, an independent clinical neurologist (with experience in MS clinical trials), an independent pharmacovigilance and safety expert , an MRI expert and a t least one  
representative  of the s ponsor. All members of the steering committee will stay blinded 
throughout the trial until data base lock and unblinding, and will only review blinded data until then.
 
The first formal safety review will occur after about  60 patients  have received the IMP for  at 
least 3 months. Subsequently, periodic safety reviews will occur on regular intervals, at least once per year. 
Recruitment  will not be interrupted due to the scheduled safety reviews by the steering 
committee. The sponsor or any member of the steering committee may request an ad -hoc 
meeting for any reason, including a significant unexpected safety event, unplanned unblinding

review, patient  incidence rates of AEs (including all S AEs, serious treatment -related events, 
AESIs, and events leading the discontinuation of the IMP ) will be tabulated by system organ 
class, preferred term, and severity grade. Listings and/or narratives of  deaths and other serious 
AEs as well as reasons for discontinuations, stopping criteria regarding liver enzymes, and 
clinically significant laboratory abnormalities occurring during the trial will be provided. 
Records of all meetings will be archived. The steering committee will recommend modification 
or termination of the trial to the sponsor , if considered necessary . Further details will be provided 
in a separate steering committee charter.  
16 Biostatistical methods  
16.1 Sample size calculation 
The sample size calculation is based on the primary endpoint assessed at Week  24 after the main 
treatment period: the difference between 45  mg/day IMU -838 and placebo in the cumulative 
number of CUA MRI lesions at Week 24. In this early stage developmen t trial, a higher α, i.e. 
0.1, than the standard 0.025 level is considered appropriate. The assumptions for the effect size 
for this trial using IMU -838 are derived from a Phase 2 trial of teriflunomide, a drug that shares 
the mechanism of action with IMU -838. [21] For a sample size calculation based on a test for 
the ratio of two negative binomial rates, the negative binomial dispersion parameter has to be assumed, which is  difficult without data of previous similar studies being available for analysis. 
Publication s containing results of modeling the number of new enhancing lesions in MS using 
a negative binomial model were used to get an impression of the magnitude of the negative binomial dispersion parameter.  [22,23 ] The values for the parameter ϑ reported in these two 
publications ranged from 0.6 to 0.75. Since the binomial disper sion parameter used in PASS 
15.0.4 equals 1/ϑ, dispersion parameter values of 1.3 and 1.7 correspond to the published modeling results. To be conservative, the higher value of 1.7 was used for the sample size calculation. Additionally, medical experts  gene rally agree that the overall activity status of 
patients suffering from MS  declines  secondary to improved diagnostic criteria, which allows 
early imaging -based diagnosis and early treatment start with broadly available effective 
treatment options in the countries selected for this trial. W e believe that for these reasons the 
mean event rate for the placebo arm is likely lower than that observed in the historical Phase 2 
trial of teriflunomide, and therefore  slightly  more conservative assumptions were made f or the 
placebo event rate.

Confidential   
 Underlying assumptions:  
Primary endpoint: cumulative number of CUA MRI lesions up to    Week 24  
Randomization ratio:    1:1 (45 mg/day I MU-838:placebo)  
Power:    80% 
Significance level:    0.1, 1- sided  
Average exposure time:    24 weeks  
Mean event rate per 24 weeks for 45  mg/day IMU -838: 4.5 
Mean event rate per 24 weeks for placebo:   8.0 
Negative binomial dispersion parameter:   1.7 
 
Based on these assumptions the necessary sample size per group is 51.  Assuming a drop- out 
rate of 25%, about 65 patients will be randomized to each of the dose groups. 
16.2 Analysis sets and types of analyses  
Safety analysis set  
The safety analysis set (SAF) will consist of all randomized patients who received at least one 
dose of IMP , i.e. any dose of IMU -838 or placebo. If it is uncertain if the patient has received 
any IMP, the patient will be included in the SAF. The analyses based on the SAF will be 
conducted on an “as treated” basis, i.e. all patients will be analyzed by the treatment they received.  
Full analysis set  
The full analysis set (FAS) will consist of all randomized patients who received at least one dose of IMP, i.e. any dose of IMU -838 or placebo. The analyses based on the FAS will be conducted 
on an intention- to-treat procedure, i.e. all pat ients will be analyzed by the groups to which they 
were randomized to.  
Per-protocol set  
All patients of the FAS will also be included in a per- protocol (PP) set if they did not violate 
any major protocol criteria. Protocol deviations will be identified and classified for each patient during a blind data review. 
Assignment of analysis sets to analyses and allocation of patients  
All efficacy analyses will be based on the FAS. The primary and the key secondary efficacy 
endpoint only will be additionally analyzed for the PP set. The analysis of the primary and the key secondary efficacy endpoi nt using the FAS will be considered confirmatory according to 

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 101 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 the rules of the hierarchical testing procedure. All other analyses will be exploratory. Sa fety 
analyses will be based on the SAF.  
The allocation of patients to the analysis sets for the final analysis of the main treatment period 
will be done during a blind data review meeting. The analysis sets to be used for the analysis of the extended treatment period will be defined in the corresponding statistical analysis plan (SAP). 
16.3 Statistical analyses  
For qualitative variables, the frequencies (absolute and relative) will be calculated. Quantitative parameters will be described by declaring the mean value, standard deviation, minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum. The different treatment groups will be separately tabulated. A detailed description of the statistical analyses for all scheduled analyses (i.e. final analysis of the ma in treatment period and analyses for the extended treatment period) will be 
provided in an SAP and will be finalized before any data will be analyzed, i.e. before the final 
analysis of the main treatment period.  
16.4 Primary and key secondary efficacy analyses 
Since the primary and key secondary endpoint data (cumulative number of CUA MRI lesions 
at Week 24) represent count data, it is planned to analyze the primary and key secondary endpoint using a generalized linear model with a negative binomial distribution and a 
logarithmic link function. The following independent effects will be included in the models 
• Treatment group  
• Baseline volume of T2 lesions 
• MRI field strength of 1.5 or 3.0 Tesla (factor groups used for stratification) 
• Number of Gd+ lesions (factor groups used for stratification)  
A hierarchical testing procedure will be applied for the primary and the key secondary efficacy endpoint. Both tests will be performed at a significance level of 0.1 (1- sided). In case of a 
non-significant result for the prima ry endpoint, the hierarchical testing procedure will be 
stopped and the analysis of the key secondary endpoint will be considered exploratory. 
17 Patient withdrawal from trial participation  
Participation in the trial is voluntary and patients may withdraw from the trial at any time and 
for any reason. However, all patients will be encouraged to complete the trial. All patients 
withdrawing from the trial will be encouraged to complete the EoS assessment 30 days 
(+14 days) after the last intake of the IMP (also refer to Section 12.7) .  

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 102 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 Patients will be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons  (the primary reason 
leading to patient withdrawal will be documented):  
• Patient withdraws consent  due to 
o AE(s)  
o MS related clinical events  
o other reason  (to be specified) 
• Investigator decision due to  
o AE(s), which in the opinion of the investigator may jeopardize the patient’s health 
or may compromise the trial objectives 
o relevant non-compliance with the protocol, which in the opinion of the investigator may jeopardize the trial integrity or scientific goals of the trial  
o reasons other than AE or non- compliance (to be specified) 
• Pregnancy 
• Fulfilling hepatoxicity -related stopping rules (see Section  15.2.2.2)  
• Treatment with prohibited concomitant medication  (see Section  11.2.2)  
• Violation of inclusion or exclusion criteria noted only after randomization  
• The trial  is terminated by the sponsor 
 
The primary reason for discontinuation from the trial is to be recorded in the source documents 
and on the early termination page of the eCRF. 
If the patient withdraws consent, no further evaluations should be performed and no attempts 
should be made to collect additional data. 
Patients who prematurely discontinue the trial will be treated according to the  investigator’s 
discretion an d standard t reatment guidelines, irrespective of the reason for withdrawal , and will 
not be replaced . 
Reasonable efforts will be made to contact any patient lost to follow up, to complete assessments 
(including an EoS assessment) and to retriev e any outstanding data and IMP and supplies. 
If the IMP will be prematurely discontinued , the primary reason for discontinuation is to be 
recorded in the appropriate section of the eCRF. Patients who discontinue therapy with study 
drug will be encouraged to continue with study -related assessments (including EoS visit) until 
their trial completion.

 18 Ethical and legal requirements  
18.1 Ethical conduct of the trial  
The trial will be conducted in a manner consistent with all applicable regulatory authority and 
IEC regulations (e.g. International Council for Harmonisation [ ICH] Guideline for Good 
Clinical Practice [GCP, CPMP/ICH/135/95] and  the Declaration of Helsinki [version  of 1996]) 
as well as in keeping with applicable local law(s) and regulation(s).  The investigator must also 
comply with all appli cable privacy regulations ( for EU: General Data Protec tion Regulation 
[24]). 
18.2 Independent ethics committee  
Before the initiation of the clinical trial, the final protocol, any amendments if applicable, the 
patient  information sheet and consent form, as well as any additional documents which are 
required by national regulations and the IEC will be submitted to t he competent IEC for review. 
A favorable opinion for the clinical trial must be obtained from the IEC before any patient  is 
enrolled at a center.  
If appropriate, any additional requirements imposed by the IEC will be followed. Amendments 
to the trial documents will be notified to, or approved by, the IEC before implementation, if 
applicable. 
18.3 Patient  information and consent procedure  
Before any clinical trial- related activities are performed, the investigator (or authorized 
designee) must review the informed consent form and explain the trial  to potential trial 
participants . The investigator must ensure that the patient is fully informed about the aims, 
procedures, potential risks, any discomforts, and expected benefits of the clinical trial. Before 
consenting, the patient  must be left with ample time to consider and ask questions. It must be 
emphasized that participation is voluntary and that the patient  has t he right to withdraw from 
the clinical trial at any time without prejudice. The patient and the investigator must then sign 
and date the consent form before the conduct of any trial procedures.  
A copy of the patient  information and informed consent form will be given to the patient s for 
their records. The rights and welfare of the patients  will be protected by emphasizing to them 
that the quality of their medical care will not be adversely affected if they decline to  participate 
in this clinical trial. 
If amendments to the final trial protocol affect the patient ’s participation in the clinical trial (e.g. 
a change in any procedure), the patient  information and informed consent form must be updated 

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 104 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 to incorporate this modification, and patient s must agree to sign the amended form indicating 
that they re -consent to participate in the clinical trial. 
18.4 Insurance coverage  
Insurance coverage for damages emerging from the clinical trial will be provided according to 
applicable legal requirements. During the informed consent procedure, the investigator must 
inform the patient  accordingly. Insurance details will be provided to the patient within the 
patient  information sheet. 
18.5 Submission to authorities  
Documents required for the t rial application will be submitted to the responsible competent 
authority (CA). The trial  will not start until this authority has authorized the trial. Amendments 
to the trial protocol or to any other documents that must be reviewed by the CA will also be 
submitted to the CA in accordance with the regulatory requirements. If applicable, approval of the amendment must be awaited before implementing any changes. 
18.6 Patient  confidentiality  
The trial protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in strict 
confidence. No information concerning the clinical trial or the data will be released to any 
unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the sponsor. 
Personal patient  data will be kept confidential in compliance with the General Data Protection 
Regulation [24], and other applicable international and national requirements.  
The investigator must ensure tha t the confidentiality and anonymity  of trial participant s will be 
maintained and that their identities are protec ted from unauthorized parties. I n eCRFs, 
compensation documentation, or any other documents subm itted to the sponsor or sponsor’ s 
designee, patients  must be identified only by their identification codes; it is not allowed to use 
their names, addresses, telephone numbers, or similar information. The investigator will keep 
the original of the Patient  Identification Log (including complete name and date of birth of each 
patient ) in his/her file. The investigator must maintain these documents in strict confidence.  
To allow compliance with GCP, all patient s will be asked for consent regarding the access to 
their personal clinical trial- related data for monitoring, audits, and inspections as well as 
regarding transmission and storage of their pseudonymous data; a respective statement will be part of the informed consent form. Professionals getting access to sou rce data for monitoring, 
audits and inspections are bound to preserve strict confidentiality.

 19 Criteria for premature termination of the trial and criteria for 
initializing and closing a trial  center  
19.1 Criteria for halting or terminating the trial  
The sponsor reserves the right to halt or terminate the trial at any time. Reasons for termination 
include but are not limited to:  
• Potential health risk for the patients  
• High withdrawal rate  
• New scientific know ledge becomes available that makes the objectives of the trial no 
longer feasible  or valid  
• Insufficient enrollment of patients  
19.2 Criteria for closing a trial  center  
A trial center may be closed for the following reasons:  
• The center is unable to recruit sufficient patients within the agreed time frame  
• The center does not respond to trial management requests  
• Multiple significant protocol devia tions or substantial non- compliance  
• The approval of the IEC in charge of the clinic al trial is permanently revoked 
• Additional local criteria might be established by written agreements between the sponsor 
and the trial center  
The sponsor will notify the relevant CA, IEC(s), and investigator(s) in writing about the 
termination of individual centers or the whole trial . 
The investigator may terminate his/her participation prematurely. If the investigator decides to 
terminate his/her participation before the trial is completed, he/she will notify the sponsor in 
writing stating the reasons for the early termination. In terminating the trial , the sponsor and the 
investigator will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patients’ 
interests.  
The investig ator will notify the relevant CAs  and IEC(s) in writing , if required, submit a copy 
of that notification to the sponsor and return all IMP s and all related trial material, as applicable,  
to the sponsor. Concerned eCRFs will be archived at the site. Authori zation to access and edit 
the eCRF will be removed from the investigator and all authorized delegates .

 20 Trial  protocol, documentation and archiving of data  
20.1 Amendments to the protocol  
Any change to the protocol concerning the purpose of the trial , the trial design, or the patient’s 
eligibility can only be made in the form of a written amendment to the trial protocol. Such 
amendments must  be discussed and signed by the sponsor and the investigator before 
implementation.  
Substantial amendments, i.e. amendments likely affecting to a significant degree  
• the safety or physical or mental integrity of the patients of the trial  
• the scientific value of the trial  
• the conduct or management of the trial , or 
• the quality or safety of any IMP  used in the trial 
will be submitted to the CA and IEC  for approval and favorable opinion as required by 
applicable regulations. If such amendments affect the patient’s participation in the clinical trial 
(e.g. a change in any procedure), the patient information and informed consent  form must be 
updated to incorporate this modification, and patients enrolled at the time of implementation of the amendment must re -consent to their participat ion in the clinical trial.  
Non-substantial changes, e.g. minor corrections of administrative nat ure and/or rephrasing,  
which do not meet the above criteria for being substantial , are considered editorial changes. The 
IEC and CA  do not need to be notified of such minor corrections. Non-substantial amendments 
will be signed by the sponsor only.  
If new events occur related to the conduct of the trial or the development of the tested IMP  that 
may affect the safety of the patients, the sponsor and the investigator will take appropriate safety measures to protect the patients against any immediate hazard. T he sponsor will immediately 
inform the CA and IEC  of the new events and the measures taken.  
20.2 Protocol deviations  
A protocol deviation is a failure to follow, intentionally or unintentionally, the requirements of the protocol. As required by national regulation or guidelines, reports of deviati ons will be 
provided to the IEC . 
In emergency circumstances, deviations from the protocol may proceed without prior 
consultation with  the sponsor a nd favorable opinion of the IEC , if the rights, safety and well -
being of the patients  need to be protected. Such deviations will be documented and reported to 
the sponsor and the IEC as soon as possible in accordance with national regulations.  

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 107 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 All protocol deviations will be listed . If concerned patient s are evaluable f or data analysis will 
be discussed in a data review meeting prior to statistical analyse s. 
20.3 Data retention  
The trial center  and the sponsor or sponsor’s designee(s)  will maintain all trial records according 
to ICH GCP and applicable regulatory requirement(s). Record s will be retained until at least 2 
years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region, until there are no 
pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region, until at least 2 years have elapsed sin ce the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the test ed IMP , and at least 
15 years  after the end of the trial, whiche ver period is longer. The final report will be kept for 
another 5 years after the  tested IMP  was taken off the market according  to legal stipulations. 
The documents will  be archived for a longer period, if required by the applicable regulatory 
authorities or if agreed with the sponsor. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigators when  these documents need  not to be retained  any longer . 
The medical files of trial  patients must be retained in accordance with local legislation and in 
accordance with the maximum period of time permitted by the hospital, institution or private practice.

 21 Data collection, m onitoring and quality assurance 
21.1 Data collection  
All data will be collected on an eCRF separately for each patient. eCRFs will be provided as a 
regulatory compliant, electronically secure and protected web -based database, and will be 
handled in accordance with the instructions provided. An audit trail will record all entries and 
corresponding changes.  
The trial sites will be provided with secure access to and training on the eCRF.  
All data generated after the patient  provided informed consent must be recorded in the eCRF. 
The treating investigator is responsible for ensuring accurate and proper completion of the 
eCRF.  
Only treating physician  and authorized designees will enter and edit data via a secure network 
and a secure access system. Completed data for each visit will be approved by the investigator 
or authorized designee using an electronic signature to confirm the accuracy of the data. Any 
change or addition will be recorded by an electronic audit trail system.  
The investigat or or designee has to carefully answer queries issued by data m anagement.  
21.2 Source data  
Source data are defined as all data in original records and certified copies of original records of 
clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial that are necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial (see ICH E3 GCP, 1.51). Source records should be 
stored for a time period as defined by local regulations.  
The investigator must keep a patient file (medical file, original medical re cords) on paper or 
electronically for every patient included in the trial.  
It must be possible to identify each patient  by using this patient  file. Dates and authors of al l 
source  data entry and changes must be clearly  identifiable . 
Documents and data to be considered source data will be identified and agreed with the investigator in advance of the first screening visit. The location of all source data will be documented and filed in the Investigator Site File  (source data  location form).  
Electronic pat ient files will be printed whenever the monitor performs source data verification. 
Printouts must be signed and dated by the investigator, countersigned by the monitor, and filled at the center  as required for other source data documents.

Confidential   
 21.3 Monitoring  
The e xtent and details of monitoring including source data verification will be specified in the 
monitoring plan.  
The trial center must not enroll any patient before the initiation visit was performed and final 
eligibility  of the center  is confirmed by the moni tor and Sponsor . During the trial , further 
monitoring visits will be performed according to ICH GCP, the sponsor’s designee’s or local 
CRO’s standard operating procedures, and local regulations. eCRFs will be reviewed against 
source data for adherence to t he trial protocol and ICH GCP, as well as for completeness, 
accuracy, and consistency of data. Additionally, the monitor will check the progress of 
enrolment, and will ensure that the IMP is being stored, dispensed and accounted for according 
to specifications. Key trial personnel must be available to assist the monitor during these visits.  
The investigators must permit the monitor` s access to the patient’s medical records and all 
applicable source documents . Throughout the trial, all data captured in the eCRF will only be 
identified by patient number. The data will be blinded correspondingly in all data analyses.  
It is the investigators’ obligation to assure documentation of all relevant d ata in the patient’s 
file, such as medical history and concomitant diseases, date of trial enrolment, visit dates, results 
of examinations, administrations of IMP and any concomitant medication, and AEs. 
21.4 Audits and inspections  
During the trial, audits may be performed by independent auditors. Audits of clinical research 
activities will be performed in accordance with corresponding standard operating procedures to 
ensure compliance with the principles of GCP.  
Regulatory authorities may wish to conduct an ins pection. If an inspection is requested, the 
investigator must inform the sponsor or sponsor’s designee immediately.  
The investigator must allow audit ors or inspectors  access to source data and documents and will 
answer any questions.  
21.5 Data management procedures  
All data management a ctivities will be conducted by the sponsor’s designee following their 
standard operating procedures.  
Details on data handling will be descri bed in the data management plan. Data entered into the 
eCRF will be validated through online edit checks and offline checks run by the data manager according to the data validation plan. For all identified discrepancies, the data manager will raise 
a query in the electronic data capture application. The appropriate investigational personnel will 

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 110 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 answer the queries in the eCRF , which will be audit trailed by the electronic data capture 
application.  
The sponsor’s designee will handle the data cleaning process, query process , and coding. 
For the main analysis, the respective database will be locked when it is considered complete and 
accurate and after all changes following the data review meeting (if applicable) are included 
(i.e. all data cleaning activities performed). All changes will be tracked (audit trail). Sponsor approval prior to database lock is mandatory.  
21.6 Trial  report and publications  
The results of the main  treatment period will be summarized in a clinical trial report according 
to the ICH E3 Note for guidance on structure and content of clinical trial reports. Results of the 
extended treatment period  will be reported in an addendum  to the clinical trial report.  
Regular safety update reports  will be submitted to investigators as well as to regulatory 
authorities and IECs, as appropriate, within the timeframes defined per national regulation or 
by the IEC.  
The preparation and submission of abstracts or manuscripts including the trial results will be 
coordinated by the steering committee . The publication or presentation of any trial results shall 
comply with all applicable privacy laws.

  1. Background and rationale 
In the Cohort 1 main analysis of this trial the  primary and key secondary endpoints have been 
met with high statistical significance i.e. both IMU -838 doses statistically significantly reduced 
the number of CUA MRI lesions  up to Week 24 as compared to placebo. The reduction was 
62% with 45 mg IMU -838 (p = 0.0002, 1- sided, primary endpoint) and 70% with 30 mg 
IMU -838 (p <0.0001, 1- sided, key secondary endpoint). All other secondary endpoints, 
including other MRI parameters , clinical endpoints such as relapses and biomarkers such as 
neurofilament light chain , also provided a noticeable and numerical benef it for IMU -838 as 
compared to placebo. IMU -838 in this trial was safe and well -tolerated in patients with RRMS . 
The rate of TEAEs  was similar in IMU -838 and placebo -treated patients  (30 mg: 45.1%, 45 mg: 
40.6%, placebo: 43.5%) . Serious TEAEs  were rare and only observed in 3 out of 140 IMU -838-
treated patients, and in 1 out of 69 placebo -treated patients. The rate of treatment withdrawals 
in the 24- week blinded treatment period was only 4.3% in the pooled IMU -838 treatment arms 
versus 7.2% in the placebo group. Based on these results both doses, 30 and 45 mg/day IMU -838, appear to be equally safe and 
effective in patients with RRMS . Although there was no safety signal in the Cohort 1 main 
analysis for either doses, the lowest effective dose 30 mg/day IMU -838 may be proposed to be 
investigated in further trials in RRMS, including the planned Phase 3 trial. However , and given 
the relative equal performance of the 2 doses in Cohort 1 and to allow for pharmacodynamic

Confidential   
 modeling of the dose -response relationship, data from a low er dose in the effective dose range 
will be required. The objective of the Cohort 2 sub- trial is thus to obtain exploratory data on the 
dose response of IMU -838 by evaluating a lower IMU -838 dose i.e. 10 mg/day to provide 
additional data for pharmacodynamic modelling.  
The 10 mg IMU -838 dose was selected since it is more than 50% lower than the lowest effective 
dose of Cohort 1 (30 mg IMU 838) and avoids undesired overlap in serum trough levels for 
pharmac odynamic modelling of the pooled Cohort 1 and 2 data.  
The 10 mg/day dose is expected to show  noticeable efficacy in the Cohort 2 sub- study as an  
interim analysis of the ongoing Trial P2 -IMU -838-UC in patients with  ulcerative colitis , 
confirmed that the 10 mg dose lies within the potential  effective dose range of IMU -838 i.e. this  
interim analysis  showed  that none of the doses used (10 mg, 30 mg, or 45 mg IMU -838) was 
either likely ineffective or intolerable expanding the expected effective dose range of IMU -838 
in immunological diseases . In summary, the dose of 10 mg/day IMU -838 is expected to be an 
effective dose in th is Cohort 2 sub- trial. A small placebo arm is included to  provide blinding of 
patients and to relate  Cohort 2 treatment effects.  
Assessments and procedures will mostly follow those described for the main treatment period in the Cohort 1 main trial. However, some assessments not necessary for pharmacodynamic 
mode lling from  Cohort  2 data will not be performed  as well as few new exploratory biomarker 
data are added . Additionally, only MRI machines with a field strength of 1.5 Tesla will be 
allowed  to provide more homogeneous MRI data for pharmacodynamic modelling. T he 
Cohort  1 main trial allowed  MRI assessments  of 1.5 and 3 Tesla. As there was a strong 
imbalance of cases between 1.5 Tesla and 3 Tesla, the uncertainty of statistical estimators for adjustment of means for the 3 T esla MRI cases was very high.  
In addition, an unblinded interim analysis o f selected MRI data is planned after all Cohort 2 
patients have completed W eek 12 assessment s. In the Cohort 1 main analysis a recognizable 
reduction of the number of CUA and Gd+  lesions by IMU -838 as compared to placebo was 
already observed at Week 12. This interim analysis will therefore provide an early assessment of dose -response of the 10 mg/day dose and will facilitate expeditious regulatory discussions 
for Phase 3 execution. The in terim analysis after Week 12 would be performed without revealing 
individual treatment assignments to the Sponsor, however the interim analysis will provide very 
selected group -level MRI data.  As all or almost all Cohort 2 patients may have already 
completed the final Week 24 assessment of the main treatment period of Cohort 2 when the 
interim analysis is performed , the impact for the conduct of the Cohort 2 sub -trial may be 
minimal, if any. 
PBMC- based pharmacodynamic biomarkers, PRO questionnaires (TSQM), coagulation 
assessments, miR -122, JCV -DNA, and genotyping parameters are not necessary for 

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 124 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 pharmacodynamic modelling and were already assessed in the Cohort 1 main trial. Thus, such 
assessments are unnecessary for the objectives of Cohort 2 and will not be performed in this 
Cohort 2 sub- trial. Additional assessments in Cohort 2 that were not performed in the Cohort 1 
include fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF -19), 7α -Hydroxy-4- cholesten -3-one (C4), a nd high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol as indicated in Table  2. 
7α-Hydroxy-4- cholesten -3-one (C4) is an intermediate in the biochemical synthesis of bile acids 
from ch olesterol. The FGF -19 is a protein that in humans functions as a hormone, regulating 
bile acid synthesis. High -density lipoprotein (HDL)  cholesterol  is a commonly performed 
surrogate value  for hepatic reverse cholesterol transport.  Change in serum C4, FGF-19 and HDL 
cholesterol  concentrations may be indicative for activation of certain nuclear receptors by 
medications.  
2. Trial  design  
2.1 Overall trial design   
This is a double -blind, placebo- controlled, randomized, parallel -group sub- trial of  
P2-IMU -838-MS to assess the efficacy and safety of once- daily oral 10 mg/day IMU -838 
compared to placebo in patients with RRMS and evidence of active disease. 
The design generally follows the design of the main trial. However,  only MRI machines with a 
field strength of 1.5 Tesla will be allowed (the main trial allowed ≥1.5 Tesla, for reasons see 
Section 1 of this Appendix). An overview is given in Figure  2 below. Screening ( 12.2) and 
eligibility (Section  9) will be the same as in the Cohort 1 main trial.  
Before any clinical activities for the sub -trial are performed, patients will be informed by the 
investigator (or authorized designee, see Section 18) about this tria l and the risk profile of 
IMU -838 and patients will have to sign an informed consent form specific to this Cohort 2 sub-
trial. 
Main treatment period  
Patients in the Cohort 2 sub- trial main treatment part will be randomized 1:4 to placebo and 
10 mg IMU -838 for 24 weeks. All patients will receive half the assigned dose during the first 
7 days of the main treatment period (1 tablet per day) and the full assigned dose from Day 7 
onwards (2 tablets once daily). Clinic visits after Day 0 during the double -blind Cohort 2 main 
treatment period will be scheduled at Day 7, and at Weeks 6 , 12, 18 and 24, with MRI 
assessments at Weeks 6 , 12, 18 and 24. At Week 24 (EoMT ), patients will have the option to 
continue into the extended treatment period if they meet respective eligibility criteria as described in Sections 9.2  and 9.3 of this protocol. An unblinded interim analysis evaluating 
selected MRI  parameters will be performed at Week 12  (see Section  2.3 below).

Confidential   
 Extended treatment period  
Treatment during the extended period will be open label . The recommended dose for the 
extended treatment period will be 30 mg/day. However, based on discussion between  
investigator an d patient 45 mg/day IMU -838/day may also be used as this dose was also  found 
to be safe and effective in the Cohort 1 main analysis. Switching between open- label doses will 
be allowed in the extended treatment period, as described for patients in Cohort 1. Although the 
treatment in the extended treatment period will be always open, the treatment assignment during the main treatment period for patients and investigators will be kept blinded until after database 
lock of the main treatment period of the sub- trial. Identical to the start of the main treatment 
period, all patients will receive half the assigned dose during the first 7  days of  the extended 
treatment period and will then continue with the full assigned dose.  
The extended treatment period will be terminated for patients in the Cohort 2 sub- trial at the day 
the last patient of the Cohort  1 main trial has completed the respective extended treatment 
period, prematurely or as scheduled.  
End-of-study visit  
All patients discontinuing treatment, as scheduled or prematurely, will undergo an EoS visit 
30 days (+14 days) after last IMP administration.

Matching placebo, once -daily oral administration of 1 or 2 tablets, as described for the test 
product and Section 11.1 
Prior and concomitant medications; precautions and restrictions  
Will be applied as in main trial (Section 11.3)  
2.3 Randomization, b linding and unblinding procedures  
Randomization will be done either by a voice -interactive system or manually by an unblinded 
designee . At randomization, all IMP kits for the entire 24- week main treatment duration will be 
assigned  to each patient;  however IMP kits will be handed out to patients only during visits as 
outlined in Table 2 . Since only 1.5 T esla MRI machines will be used, stratification of 
randomization for MRI field strength is not necessary and stratification will only consider 
number of Gd+ lesions in baseline MRI (0 Gd+ lesion; ≥1 Gd+ lesion) . 
Other procedures w ill be applied as in the main study (Section  10), however there will be no re -
randomization at the start of the extended treatment period as the extended treatment period of 
the Cohort 2 sub- trial will be open  right from the start of the extended treatment period  (while 
in Cohort 1 it was blinded until the main results for the main treatment were  available).  
Blinding during the interim analysis of the main treatment period  
An interim analysis will be performed after all Cohort 2 patients have completed the Week 12 
assessments. Care will be taken to maintain the blind  regarding individual treatment assignments 
for the S ponsor, patients, investigators and other study personnel during this  analys is to avoid 
introducing any biases. This will include that only very selected group- level data are provided 
to the S ponsor, that any reference to individual patients or of potentially unblinding information  
in footnotes and listing will be avoided and that investigators will not be informed about the 
data of the interim analysis.  
After all patients have completed their Week 12 assessments the respective data base will be 
locked, data unblinded and analyzed.  
Access to interim individual patient data will be restricted to an independent data manager and 
an independent biostatistician performing the interim analys is. The following s elected data will 
be analyzed and respective group level averages without minimum and maximum values  will 
be made available to the Sponsor : 
• cumulative CUA MRI lesions until Week 12 
• cumulative Gd+ lesions until Week 12  
• number of patients without CUA MRI le sions until Week 12  

P2-IMU -838-MS, EMPhASIS  Clinical trial protocol  Final  3.0 (28 -Aug-2020)  Page 128 of 134 
 
Confidential   
 • number of patients without Gd+ lesions until Week 12 
In order to provide sufficient data points in the placebo arm, Cohort 1 placebo patients  from the 
same sites that contributed to the Cohort 2 Week 12 data and investigated using 1.5 T esla MRI 
examinations will be allowed to enrich the Cohort 2 placebo arm. In addition, summary data 
from Cohort 1 30 mg/day and 45 mg/day data may be shown as co mparison to Cohort 2 data 
from 10 mg/day IMU -838, however the same restriction for sites and 1.5 Tesla MRI as for 
placebo will apply. Details will be described in the SAP for Cohort 2. To minimize bias, the SAP for the interim analysis will be finalized be fore any data will be analyzed. 
Aggregate data on accrual and drop -out rates, and reasons for ineligibility and discontinuation 
will also be made available for the Sponsor. 
2.4 Trial  patients  
Number of patients (total and for each treatment) planned  
Approximately 60 patients are planned to be randomized 1: 4 to treatment with placebo  or 
10 mg/day (12:48 patients) in the main treatment period.  
No formal sample size calculation was performed for this sub -trial but N  = 60 randomized 
patients are considered sufficient for a robust estimation of the dose response and 
pharmacodynamic modelling. 
The maximum numbers of Cohort 2 patients randomized will be 30 per center and 50 per 
country.  
Eligibility criteria  and withdrawal of patients  
For the main treatment and extended treatment periods eligibility will be applied as in the main 
study (Sections  9 and 17) . 
2.5 Objectives and endpoints

2.6 Study schedule  
A schedule of assessments of the main treatment part for the Cohort 2 sub- trial is provided in 
Table 2.  The assessment and procedures for patients who will continue into the extended period will 
follow those describe for the Cohort 1 main trial ( Table 1). However, the extended treatment 
period will be terminated for patients in the Cohort 2 sub- trial, at the day the last patient of the 
Cohort 1 main trial has completed or discontinued the extended treatment period. The extended treatment period  in this sub- trial will thus be shorter and the EoT will be before V46 (W516) as 
indicated in Table 1.  
For more details on procedures (except for FGF- 19 and C4) to be performed at the visits  
described in Table 2 please refer to the main t rial (Section 12).   
If a patient prematurely discontinues th is Cohort 2 sub- trial before Week  24 (for possible 
reasons, please see Section  17), all assessments schedu led for the EoMT visit should be 
performed . All patients who prematurely discontinue the Cohort 2 sub- trial will be encouraged 
to complete the EoMT visit, and the EoS assessments at 30  days (+14 days) after the last IMP 
intake.

a Within 28 days f rom Baseline (Day 0). If the baseline MRI is repeated, the screening period maybe extended. However, 
patients must be randomized within 14 days of the repeated baseline MRI. Screening Visit 1 assessments will be valid for 
up to 60 days until the day of ran domization, but will have to be repeated if exceeding 60 days. If results of the baseline 
MRI assessments are not available withi n 14 days (either after the first or, if applicable, after the repeated MRI) 
randomization can be delayed by up to 7 days, whic h may also result in an extension of the screening period.  
b Including the history of autoimmune diseases (other than MS).  
c Including height (only at Screening), respiratory rate, weight, blood pressure, pulse rate, and body temperature.

 d Any positive local urine pregnancy test has to be followed up with a confirmatory local blood pregnancy test.  
e Can be repeated if initial MRI s can is not at least partially assessable . 
f Serum pregnancy test at central laboratory.  
g Samples to be stored at -20 °C until n ext scheduled dry-ice shipment to central laboratory.  
h During the first week of treatment: 1 tablet once daily; other weeks: 2 tablets once daily.  
i The result of this local pregnancy test must be available and negative before the first IMP can be taken.  
j Only for patients who continue into the extended treatment phase . 
k If the central reader evaluates the quality of the baseline MRI as not sufficient, the MRI must be repeated as soon as 
possible.  
l Taken at 3 to 10 hours post -dose (in addition to the sa mple which is collected pre- dose at the same day for IMU -838 
trough values).  
m If, based on new neurological symptoms of the patient, the treating physician suspects that the patient may have an MS 
relapse (as defined in this protocol), an EDSS assessment by the evaluating physician and an assessment of MS relapse by 
the treating physician (based on the EDSS) must be performed at this visit.  
n The sample can be stored at - 20°C for up to 1 year and dry ice shipment can be combined with another dry ice shipme nt. 
However, the last dry ice shipment should be done when the last Cohort 2 patient has complet ed the MT period.  
o The dry ice shipment should be generally done immediately after Week 24 visit. However, it may be delayed by up to 4 weeks if the dry ice shipment can be combined with the dry ice shipment for another patient at the same site.  
p To be performed only up to the time of last patient last visit of the main treatment period in the Cohort 2 sub -trial 
(Week  12). Investigators will be notified immediately.  
q Taken pre -dose and at 3 to 6 hours post -dose. 
r Will be measured out of neurofilament l ab kit (NFL lab kit), requires second NFL kit at Week 6 at 3 to 6 hours post -dose.

2.7 Efficacy and safety assessments 
Details on efficacy and safety assessments are described in Sections 14 and 15. MRI assessments will be done using an MRI machine with a field strength of 1.5 Tesla.  3 Tesla 
machines as in the main trial are not allowed. For this reaso n, the Cohort 2 will only allow 
inclusion and assessment s of patients at sites using 1.5 T esla MRI.  
The assessments performed will mostly include those described for the Cohort 1 main trial with 
few exceptions (for details see Section  1 of this Appendix). 
3. Biostatistical methods  and reporting  
The Cohort 2 sub- trial will be analyzed after the last patient has terminated the sub -trial and the 
data base for the su b-trial has been locked (for data collection, monitoring and quality assurance 
see Section 21. H
owever, for data collection during the Cohort 2 main treatment  period no eCRF 
but paper CRF will be used. For the extended treatment period an eCRF , as in the Cohort 1 main 
trial, will be used .

Confidential   
 All data will be analyzed descriptively as described in an SAP. The primary analysis set will be 
the FAS  (for definition see Section 16.2). No formal statistical testing will be performed.  
The cumulative number of CUA and cumulative number of new Gd+ lesions up to Week 24 
will be analyzed with a negative binomial regression model with logarithmic link function with 
treatment group, Baseline volume of T2 lesions, and number of Gd+ lesions  at Baseline as 
independent factor .  
The main analysis of Cohort 2 will be done using Cohort 2 data, however an additional analysis of pooled Cohort 1 and 2 data will be performed. In order to allow pooling of data with an identical patient population, Cohort 1 placebo patients from the same sites that contributed to the Cohort 2 Week 12 data and investigated using 1.5 T esla MRI examinations will be allowed 
to enrich the Cohort 2 placebo arm. In addition, Cohort 1 data of 30 mg/day and 45mg/day may be listed as compariso n to Cohort 2 data of 10 mg/day IMU -838, however the same restriction 
for sites and 1.5 T esla MRI as for placebo will apply. Details will be described in the SAP for 
Cohort 2.  
All safety analyses will be done descriptively. Some limited pooled safety asse ssments of 
Cohorts 1 and 2 will also be provided. The results of the Cohort 2 sub -study will be summarized in an addendum to the clinical trial 
report.
