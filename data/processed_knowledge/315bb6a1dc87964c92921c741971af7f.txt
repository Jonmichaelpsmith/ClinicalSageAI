Template Version 1.0  Page 2 METHODS:  
Study Design:  This was a 24-week (12  weeks DB and 12  weeks OL) randomized, 
placebo -controlled, parallel -group, multicenter study.   The first part of the study con sisted of 
a 2-week no -treatment Screening period and a 12 -week DB treatment phase that required a 
total of 5  visits: Screening visit, Randomization/Baseline visit, Week  4 visit, Week  8 visit, 
and an end of DB treatment visit at Week  12.  The second part of  the study consisted of a 
12-week OL treatment phase that required a total of 3  visits (Week  16, Week  20, and an end 
of treatment visit at Week  24) and a follow -up telephone call at Week  26. 
During the Screening period any current pharmacological treatment s for OAB were to be 
stopped, and the subjects were to complete 3 -day micturition diaries prior to the Baseline 
visit.  In the 12 -week DB treatment phase, e nrolled subjects who met all entry  criteria were 
eligible to be randomized to receive fesoterodine S R 4 mg or equivalent placebo once daily 
(QD) , and were randomized to receive instructions to take the study medication either in the 
evening or in the morning.  The randomization was stratified  by age (> 75 years, ≤75 years) 
so that there was a 1:1 ratio for fesoterodine to placebo within each stratum.  
The DB treatment phase was followed by a 12 -week OL phase to ensure all eligible subjects 
received fesoterodine SR treatment.  At the Week  24 visit , all sub jects ended their treatment; 
all subjects were then to be follow ed up by telephone at Week  26.  T hroughout the 24 -week 
study, subjects were permitted only 1  dose increase to fesoterodine 8  mg.  Likewise, subjects 
who increased their dose from 4  mg to 8  mg at any time during the 24 -week study were 
allowed to decrease back to the 4  mg dose; that decrease w as the final dose adjustment 
allowed.  
Study procedures are detailed in Table  1.

Template Version 1.0  Page 5 Number of Subjects  (Planned and Analyzed):   Approximately 790  subjects were planned 
to be randomized in  this study .  A total of 1045  subjects were screened of which 794  were 
assigned to study treatment  (50 in Austria, 11  in Belgium, 25  in Denmark, 97  in Finland, 
64 in Germany, 25  in Israel, 29  in Italy, 65  in Norway, 65  in Portugal, 68  in Slovakia, 80  in 
Spain, 127  in Sweden, 15  in Switz erland, 14  in Turkey, and 59 in the UK): 398 subjects to 
fesoterodine  and 396 subjects to placebo.   Of the 794  subjects randomized, 785  subjects 
received study treatment ( fesoterodine  [392]  and placebo  [393] ).  All 785  treated subjects  
were analyzed  for sa fety; 756  subjects were included in the Full Analysis Set ( FAS) for 
efficacy . 
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion :  Male or female subjects 65 years old with 
OAB symptoms (subject -reported) for 3 months prior to Screening visit according to 
Interna tional Continence Society guidelines, mean urinary frequency of 8 micturitions per 
24 hours as verified by the micturition diary prior to Randomization/Baseline visit, and mean 
number of urgency episodes per 24  hours as verified by the Screening micturiti on diary prior 
to Baselin e (urgency episodes were defined as those with Urinary Sensation Scale [USS] 
rating 3). 
Study Treatment :  Fesoterodine SR was supplied as white 4  mg or 8  mg tablets dispensed 
from a blister pack.  Placebo was provided as tablets w ith the same appearance as the 
fesoterodine SR tablets . 
In the 12 -week DB treatment phase, randomized subjects were started on a dose of 
fesoterodine SR 4  mg or equivalent placebo QD.  After 4  weeks of treatment (at the Week  4 
visit), subjects were permitt ed a one-time dose increase to 8  mg, if needed, in order to further 
optimize their treatment.  If they remained on the 4  mg dose after 4  weeks of treatment, they 
were permitted to increase their dose to 8  mg after 8  weeks of treatment (at the Week  8 visit)  
if necessary.   Any change in dose was to be made based on a clinical benefit vs tolerability 
assessment.   The DB treatment phase was fol lowed by a 12 -week OL phase to ensure all 
eligible subjects received fesoterodine SR treatment.  Subjects who received fesoterodine SR 
in the DB phase were to be maintained on the same dose during the OL phase.  Subjects who 
received placebo during the DB phase were started on fesoterodine SR 4  mg with the option 
to increase their dose to 8  mg at the Week  16 or Week  20 vis it.  Throughout the 24 -week 
study, subjects were permitted only 1  dose increase to fesoterodine 8  mg (and 1  decrease 
from 8  mg back to 4  mg, if necessary).  
Subjects were instructed to swallow, without chewing, their 1  tablet of study drug with water 
QD with or without food.  During the DB phase, subjects took study drug in the evening 
(within 4  hours of bedtime) or in the morning (within 2  hours of rising) according to 
randomization.  During the OL phase, subjects were given the choice to take their study 
medication in the evening or in the morning.

Template Version 1.0  Page 8 Week  12.  Laboratory safety tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical examinations 
were performed at Screening  only. 
Statistical Methods :  The datasets analyzed included : 
 FAS: consist ed of all subjects  who were  randomized  and took at least 1 dose of  DB 
treatment and provided baseline and post -baseline efficacy data for at least 1 endpoint 
and at least 1 time point during the DB phase . 
 Full Analysis OL Set: all subjects who took at least 1  dose of study m edication and 
provided at least 1  post DB phase efficacy measurement during the OLphase of the 
study.  
 Per Protocol (PP) Analysis Set : consisted of all subjects in the FAS who completed 
the DB treatment phase and did not deviate from or violate the protocol  in such a way 
that could affect efficacy outcome.  
 Safety Analysis Set : consisted of all subjects who took at least 1  dose of study 
medication  during the DB phase . 
 Safety OL Analysis Set : consisted of all subjects who received at least 1  dose of the 
study treatment during the OL phase of the study.  
Analysis of Primary Endpoint : The primary ana lysis for the primary endpoint w as based on 
the FAS.  An  analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model  was used  to compare fesoterodine 
(4 mg and 8  mg pooled) against placebo.   The primary model included terms for treatment, 
dosing time , age category, and study center as fixed factors and baseline value as a 
continuous covariate.  Least squares (LS) means for each treatment group and associated 
standard errors were derived.  Di fferences in LS means were calculated and associated 
2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and p -values were provided.  Summary statistics 
(N, mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviations)  were also provided for 
Baseline  and Week  12, along with  the change from Baseline  to Week  12 for each treatment 
group.  If the assumptions of any of the planned analyses were not met, then alternative 
appropriate statistical techniques were to  be used . 
Analysis of Secondary Endpoints During the DB Phase : All an alyses compared fesoterodine 
(doses of 4  and 8  mg pooled) vs placebo.  Numeric changes in frequencies for diary -derived 
endpoints were summarized and analyzed using ANCOVA in a similar way to the analysis of 
the primary endpoint.  Those endpoints based on percentage changes were summarized 
similarly to the primary endpoint and analyzed using non -parametric methods.  Binary data 
were analyzed using logistic regression models for endpoints based on diary data and 
questionnaires during the DB phase.  The model  included terms for study center, treatment 
group, dosing time, and age category.  Odds ratios (using placebo as the reference group), 
corresponding 95% CIs, and p -values were presented along with the summary statistics.  
These analyses were also supported  by simple summaries (number and percentage) at each 
visit without covariate adjustment as for categorical data.  The percentages of subjects who 
had at least 1  UUI episode in the 3 -day diary at Baseline and had no episodes in the 3 -day

percentages) were presented for each treatment group.  The Van Elteren Test was used to 
compare the continuous efficacy endpoints between the treatment groups based on 
percentage cha nges derived from the diary data.  The stratification variable was a 4 -level 
indicator (morning dosing, ≤75 years; morning dosing, >75 years; evening dosing, ≤75 years; 
evening dosing, >75 years).  Summary statistics were provided for Baseline and Weeks  4, 8, 
and 12 for each treatment group.  These summary statistics were also provided for numeric 
and percentage changes from Baseline to Weeks  4, 8, and  12. 
The PPBC and PPUS were analyzed using logistic regression (major improvement [yes/no] 
from Baseline an d minor improvement [yes/no ] from Baseline).  Frequency tables for 
Baseline and Weeks  4, 8, and  12 were presented for each treatment group.  The change from 
Baseline categories were also presented for Weeks  4, 8, and  12.  The PTBS was analyzed 
using logist ic regression.  Frequency tables (counts and percentages in each response 
category) for Week  12 were presented for each treatment group.  The OAB -q total score, 
symptom bother score , and domains were summarized for Baseline and Weeks  4, 8, and  12 
and the changes in total score, symptom bother score , and domains from Baseline were also 
summarized and analyzed using ANCOVA.  The OAB -s items were analyzed using logistic 
regression (“satisfied”/“not satisfied” for Questions  9, 10 and  11, and “meets or exceeds 
expectations”/“does not meet expectations” for Question  5).  Frequency tables were also 
presented for Week  12.  For subjects in the UK, t he KHQ domains for Baseline and Week  12 
and the changes in KHQ domains from Baseline to Week  12 were summarized , and the 
changes were analyzed using ANCOVA.  The EQ -5D total score at Baseline and Week  12 
and change from Baseline to Week  12 were summarized, and the change was analyzed using 
ANCOVA.  
Analysis of Endpoints at the end of the OL Phase:   The secondary endpoints (based on diary 
data and questionnaires during the OL phase ) were summarized as changes from Baseline to 
Week  24 and as changes from Weeks  12 to 24. 
Safety data were summarized using descriptive statistics.   Data from the DB and the OL 
phases were reported s eparately.  
RESULTS:  
Subject Disposition and Demography :  Table  2 summarizes subject disposition in the DB

fesoterodine treatment group had a greater proportion of subjects in every cat egory than the 
placebo group.  However, the rate of serious adverse events (SAE s) was less than 5% for 
both treatment groups, and only 1  of these (urinary retention in a subject receiving DB 
fesoterodine) was considered treatmen t-related by the investigato r. 
During the OL phase, greater proportions of subjects who received placebo during the DB 
phase reported TEAEs, had dose reductions or temporary discontinuations due to TEAEs, 
and discontinued from the study due to TEAEs compared to those who received fes oterodine 
during the DB phase.

Template Version 1.0  Page 33 subjects in the fesoterodine and placebo groups, respective ly, had AEs of dry mouth resulting 
in dose reduction or temporary discontinuation.  
During the OL phase, the most frequent AEs resulting in dose reduction or temporary 
discontinuation overall were dry mouth and hypertonic bladder.  A larger proportion of 
subjects in the DB placebo/OL fesoterodine group (3.5%) had AEs of dry mouth resulting in 
dose reduction or temporary discontinuation during the OL phase compared to the DB/OL 
fesoterodine group (0.6%).  
Deaths:  There were 2 deaths reported (one each in DB fe soterodine group and DB  placebo 
group ).  One subject in the DB fesoterodine group, died approximately 2  weeks after ending 
treatment.  The SAEs leading to death, all considered severe, were listed as abscess, 
appendicitis perforated, peritonitis, and sepsi s; none was considered treatment -related. One 
subject in the DB placebo group, died of metastatic colon cancer that had not been apparent 
at Screening approximately 6  weeks after ending treatment; the event was not considered 
treatment -related.  
There were no clinically meaningful changes from Baseline in vital signs during the DB or 
OL phases of the study.  
CONCLUSIONS:  
 Treatment of aged OAB subjects 65  years old and above with flexible -dose fesoterodine 
(4 mg or 8  mg QD) resulted in clinically relevant and statistically significant 
improvements compared to placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint (changes from 
Baseline in the number of micturition -related urgency episodes per 24  hours) at Week  12 
(end of the DB phase).  
 Treatment with flexible -dose fesoterodi ne (4  mg or 8  mg QD) resulted in clinically 
relevant and statistically significant improvements compared to placebo in most 
secondary diary and PRO endpoints in an  elderly population at Week 12.  
 The additional efficacy achieved with fesoterodine treatment compared to placebo in the 
primary endpoint and OAB -s items for the subgroups of subjects >75  years old (32% of 
the overall population) and those 75 years old was comparable to the results seen in the 
elder ly study population as a whole.  
 The additional ef ficacy achieved with fesoterodine treatment compared to placebo in 
bladder diary and PRO endpoints seen after 12  weeks of treatment was maintained 
through 24  weeks of treatment.  
 Subjects advancing from placebo (12  weeks of treatment in the DB phase) to fes oterodine 
(12 weeks of treatment in the OL phase) had efficacy results (for bladder diary and PRO 
endpoints) at Week  24 (end of the OL phase) that were similar to those achieved at Week 
24 by those receiving fesoterodine for 24  weeks during the DB and OL phases.  
 The overall AE and safety profiles were consistent with known effects of fesoterodine.
