Abstr act
Backgr ound: The rapid growth of research in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) continues. However, it is
unclear whether this growth reflects an increase in desirable study attrib utes or merely perpetuates the same issues previously
raised in the literature.
Objecti ve: This study aims to evaluate temporal trends in AI/ML studies over time and identify variations that are not apparent
from aggre gated totals at a single point in time.
Methods: We identif ied AI/ML studies registered on ClinicalT rials.go v with start dates between January 1, 2010, and December
31, 2023. Studies were included if AI/ML-specif ic terms appeared in the official title, detailed description, brief summary ,
interv ention, primary outcome, or sponsors’ keywords. Studies registered as systematic reviews and meta-analyses were excluded.
We reported trends in AI/ML studies over time, along with study characteristics that were fast-gro wing and those that remained
unchanged during 2010-2023.
Results: Of 3106 AI/ML studies, only 7.6% (n=235) were regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration. The most
common study characteristics were randomized (56.2%; 670/1193; interv entional) and prospecti ve (58.9%; 1126/1913;
observ ational) designs; a focus on diagnosis (28.2%; 335/1190) and treatment (24.4%; 290/1190); hospital/clinic (44.2%;
1373/3106) or academic (28%; 869/3106) sponsorship; and neoplasm (12.9%; 420/3245), nervous system (12.2%; 395/3245),
cardio vascular (11.1%; 356/3245) or pathological conditions (10%; 325/3245; multiple counts per study possible). Enrollment
data were skewed to the right: maximum 13,977,257; mean 16,962 (SD 288,155); median 255 (IQR 80-1000). The most common
size category was 101-1000 (44.8%; 1372/3061; excluding withdra wn or missing), but large studies (n>1000) represented 24.1%
(738/3061) of all studies: 29% (551/1898) of observ ational studies and 16.1% (187/1163) of trials. Study locations were
predominantly in high-income countries (75.3%; 2340/3106), followed by upper -middle-income (21.7%; 675/3106),
lower-middle-income (2.8%; 88/3106), and low-income countries (0.1%; 3/3106). The fastest-gro wing characteristics over time
were high-income countries (location); Europe, Asia, and North America (location); diagnosis and treatment (primary purpose);
hospital/clinic and academia (lead sponsor); randomized and prospecti ve designs; and the 1-100 and 101-1000 size categories.
Only 5.6% (47/842) of completed studies had results available on ClinicalT rials.go v, and this pattern persisted. Over time, there
was an increase in not only the number of newly initiated studies, but also the number of completed studies without posted results.
Conclusions: Much of the rapid growth in AI/ML studies comes from high-income countries in high-resource settings, albeit
with a modest increase in upper -middle-income countries (mostly China). Lower-middle-income or low-income countries remain

poorly represented. The increase in randomized or prospecti ve designs, along with 738 large studies (n>1000), mostly ongoing,
may indicate that enough studies are shifting from an in silico evaluation stage toward a prospecti ve comparati ve evaluation
stage. However, the ongoing limited availability of basic results on ClinicalT rials.go v contrasts with this field’s rapid advancements
and the public registry’ s role in reducing publication and outcome reporting biases.

Introduction
The number of studies on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine
learning (ML) registered on ClinicalT rials.go v has signif icantly
increased since 2016 [1,2]. While the rapid growth of research
on AI/ML is apparent [1-3], the downsides in this field have
also come to light. These include the lack of level I/II evidence
as robust proof of the clinical and economic impacts of AI [4],
lack of clinically meaningful outcomes beyond measures of
technical accurac y [5], lack of uniformity and standardization
in AI reporting [6,7], incomplete and poor reporting [8-10],
limited publication of AI/ML results [11,12], or data-source
disparities with minority subgroups potentially disadv antaged
by factors such as race, gender , and socioeconomic background
[13,14].
Previous cross-sectional studies using ClinicalT rials.go v as of
December 2020 [2] and March 2022 [1] showed that the number
of AI/ML studies continued to grow rapidly . However, it is
unclear whether this growth in number reflects an increase in
desirable study attrib utes or merely perpetuates the same issues
previously raised in the literature. For example, are study designs
conduci ve to level I/II evidence increasing over time? Do AI/ML
studies continue to run predominantly in advanced economies?
While research using ClinicalT rials.go v often reports
country-specif ic distrib utions [1,2], examining the global
distrib ution by economic measures could further elucidate
whether technological power is concentrated in a few
high-income countries.
We aimed to evaluate temporal trends over the past 14 years,
identifying variations that may not be immediately apparent
from aggre gated totals at a single point in time. We highlighted
the fastest-gro wing characteristics over time and those that have
remained unchanged. We also characterized AI/ML studies by
the following: who (lead sponsor sector), what (clinical
specialty , AI/ML terms used in study descriptions), when (start
year, primary completion year, time to results posting), wher e
(study location, geographic and economic), why(primary study
purpose), and how (study design, enrollment).
Methods
Data Sour ce
We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using
ClinicalT rials.go v, a trial registry and results database
maintained by the US National Library of Medicine. We sourced
data from the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiati ve Aggre gate
Analysis of ClinicalT rials.go v (CTTI AACT) [15], which allowsopen access to the complete set of trials registered in
ClinicalT rials.go v, including additional fields that are not readily
available in direct exports from ClinicalT rials.go v. The CTTI
AACT data dictionary is publicly accessible [16]. A static
version of the CTTI AACT database was downloaded for
analysis on February 6, 2024, via PostgreSQL (pSQL). The
pSQL codes used are provided in Multimedia Appendix 1.
Study Selection
We used text-based search to identify relevant AI/ML studies.
Our search strate gies were informed by systematic reviews
published during 2019-2023 [9,17-20]. We used search terms
related to AI/ML methodologies and specif ic model architectures
as used in the literature. Terms are not necessarily mutually
exclusi ve or hierarchical (eg, “multilayer perceptron” under
“machine learning”). The search strate gy is detailed in Table
S1 in Multimedia Appendix 2, with corresponding SQL codes
available in Multimedia Appendix 1.
Inclusion Criteria (If All of the Following Met)
1.Start date: January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2023.
2.The following search terms were used:
artificial intellig ence, ai-based, augmented intellig ence,
deep learning , convolutional neural network, deep neural
network, artificial neural network, recurr ent neural
network, generative adver sarial network, deep
reinfor cement learning , machine learning , bayesian
network, classif ication tree, elastic net, gradient boosting ,
xgboost, k nearest neighbour , multilayer perceptr on,
support vector machine, natur al langua ge processing , naive
bayes, random forest, regression tree, reinfor cement
learning , supervised learning , unsupervised learning .
These terms were searched for in the official title, brief
summary , detailed descriptions, interv ention, primary
outcome, and sponsors’ keywords.
Exclusion Criteria (If Any of the Following Met)
1.Studies registered as a meta-analysis, systematic review,
scoping review, literature review, or protocol.
2.AI/ML-related terms were part of proper nouns (eg,
organization, product, study name).
3.AI/ML-related terms were found, but they were unrelated
to the study . For example, search terms were mentioned
only in passing (eg, “previous research on AI showed
promise, ” “despite advances in machine learning”).
First, SQL was used to exclude studies containing any of the
following terms: protocol*, design*, review*, systematic
review*, scoping review*, literature review*, meta analys*s (*

denotes a wildcard, equivalent to % in SQL codes). Second, the
lead author selected studies with fewer than 5 search-w ord hits
to confirm their relevance, and irrele vant studies were excluded
(eg, those involving “neural netw orks” of a biological nature).
Third, 2 reviewers independently examined study descriptions
and assessed eligibility . Discrepancies were resolv ed through
discussion and by revisiting details on ClinicalT rials.go v. Where
study descriptions were unclear or insuf ficient, we opted to
include studies unless they explicitly met the exclusion criteria,
prioritizing sensiti vity over specif icity.
The study flow diagram is provided in Figure S1 in Multimedia
Appendix 2. The pSQL codes used are provided in Multimedia
Appendix 1.
Data Extraction and Analysis
Overview
We extracted the following data fields from the CTTI AACT
database: study start date, completion date, primary completion
date, overall status, study type, number of sites, phase,
enrollment, randomization status, masking, interv entional model,
primary purpose, target disease/condition, interv ention, time
perspecti ve, lead sponsor , lead sponsor agenc y class, funding
source, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–re gulated
status, sex, age, health y volunteers, study location, and results
availability .
Additionally , we created the 5 variables described in the
following sections.
Enrollment—Categorical
Enrollment (continuous) was categorized as follows: 1-100;
101-1000; 1001-5000; 5001-10,000; 10,001-20,000;
20,001-30,000; and >30,000. We used the most recently updated
enrollment data: planned or actual, whiche ver was more recent.
“Other” Sponsor Sectors—Disaggregated
As the sponsors of AI/ML research can be diverse, the
“OTHER” and “OTHER_GO V” fields as classif ied in
ClinicalT rials.go v are uninformati ve. We reclassif ied them into
the following based on lead sponsor names: hospital/clinic,
academia, industry , government, individual, research institute,
nonprof it, and netw ork. Academic hospitals were included in
“hospital/clinic. ”
Study Location—Global Distrib ution, Geographic and
Economic
We counted studies geographically and by gross national income
(GNI)–based classif ication as per the World Bank [21]. Each
country was classif ied by 2022 GNI per capita: low income (US
$1135 or less); lower middle income (US $1136 to US $4465);
upper middle income (US $4466 to US $13,845); and high
income (US $13,846 or more).
Clinical Specialty or Disease Area
Clinical specialties were assigned using the Medical Subject
Headings (MeSH) largest headings. Since one registered study
can involve substudies, resulting in multiple specialties, we
assigned the MeSH heading with the highest count to each study
identif ier.In cases where multiple MeSH headings had the same highest
count (ties), all those terms were included (multiple MeSH
headings per study identif ier). If MeSH headings were missing,
we used condition/disease terms submitted by sponsors to infer
the clinical areas.
Note that “radiology” is a not an organ specif ic term and not a
major MeSH heading directly linked to diseases. For example,
specif ic disease imaging indexed under terms such as “breast
neoplasms/radiograph y” or “lung diseases/radiograph y” had
been preclassif ied as neoplasms or respiratory diseases.
Screening procedures (eg, breast, colorectal) had been
preclassif ied as neoplasms in the original data. Thus, compared
to other study findings, radiology may be underrepresented,
while neoplasms may be overrepresented.
Days From Primary Completion to Posting of Results
Among completed studies mark ed with “has results, ” we
calculated the time between “primary completion date” and
“results first posted date.” We also assessed whether results
were posted within 1 year after study completion (yes/no).
We used descripti ve statistics and performed analyses in
Microsoft Excel and Python (Python Softw are Foundation). We
followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observ ational
Studies in Epidemiology (STR OBE) guidelines [22]. Ethics
appro val was not required because only publicly available data
were analyzed.
Results
Overview
The ClinicalT rials.go v search yielded 3378 records. Of those,
272 studies were excluded: not AI/ML-related (n=265);
systematic reviews or meta-analyses (n=2); and the term
“artif icial intelligence” merely being a part of the organization,
product, or study name (n=5). After excluding 272 studies, 3106
studies were included for analysis (Figure S1 in Multimedia
Appendix 2).
Tables 1and 2show the study characteristics. Overall, the
number of AI/ML studies increased rapidly after 2017, and
62.8% (1951/3106) started in the 2021 to 2023 period. Of the
3016 studies, 842 studies (27.1%) were completed, 1694
(54.5%) were active (not yet recruiting; recruiting; enrolling by
invitation; active, not recruiting), 95 (3.1%) were stopped, and
475 (15.3%) were unkno wn. There were more observ ational
studies (61.6%) than interv entional studies (38.4%); more
parallel assignments (89.2%) than crosso ver, factorial, or single
assignments; more open-labeled studies (63%) than ones that
used any form of masking; more single-center (77.2%) than
multicenter (22.8%) studies; and more studies with 2 arms
(56.8%) than 1 (34.3%) or 3 (9%) arms. The study phase was
mostly “not applicable” (93%). Studies involving adults aged
18-65 years (58.1%) were most common, followed by adults
and seniors aged 18 and above (27.5%). While some studies
accepted health y volunteers (35.2%), the majority did not
(64.8%). Only 235 (7.6%) were FDA regulated.

Study Design
Among observ ational studies, a prospecti ve design was more
common (58.9%; 1126/1913) than retrospecti ve (22.5%;
430/1913) or cross-sectional (11%; 210/1913) designs. Among
trials, 56.2% (670/1193) were randomized, 10.9% (130/1193)
were nonrandomized, and 32.8% (393/1193) were “not
applicable” (Table 1). Figure 1shows the numbers of all studies,
including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospecti ve,retrospecti ve, and cross-sectional studies, over time. From 2017
to 2023, the proportion of RCTs increased by 42.1%: from
18.52% (15/81) to 26.32% (179/680). The proportion of
prospecti ve studies increased by 22.6%: from 29.63% (24/81)
to 36.32% (247/680). In contrast, the proportion of retrospecti ve
studies decreased by 11.9%, from 12.35% (10/81) to 10.88%
(74/680), and cross-sectional studies declined by 28.5%, from
8.64% (7/81) to 6.18% (42/680).

Primary Purpose
Data on primary purpose were only available for interv entional
trials. Among the 1190 trials, the most common purposes were
diagnostic (28.2%; n=335), treatment (24.4%; n=290), “other”
(12.5%; n=149), and prevention (8.2%; n=97). However, thetop 2 rankings were reversed when restricted to RCTs only:
treatment (31.4%; n=210), diagnostic (18.6%; n=124), “other”
(11.1%; n=74), and prevention (10.9%; n=73). Over time,
studies focused on diagnosis and treatment increased faster than
others (Figure 2).

Clinical Specialty
The top 10 accounted for 81.1% (2631/3245) of all clinical
specialties (Table 2). The 3245 specialties included neoplasms
(12.9%; n=420); nervous system diseases (12.2%; n=395);
cardio vascular diseases (11%; n=356); pathological conditions
(10%; n=325); respiratory tract diseases (8.5%; n=275);
digesti ve system diseases (7.8%; n=253); mental disorders
(6.7%; n=219); endocrine, nutritional, or metabolic diseases
(5%; n=161); female urogenital diseases and pregnanc y
complications (4.3%; n=138); and skin and connecti ve tissue
diseases (2.7%; n=89). Most of these started to increase during
2018-2020 (Figure S3 in Multimedia Appendix 2). See Table
S3 in Multimedia Appendix 2for the entire list of specialties
over time.Lead Sponsor Sectors
We compared lead sponsor sectors classif ied in
ClinicalT rials.go v versus our reclassif ication based on sponsor
names (n=3106). In the original classif ication, the most common
sector was “OTHER” (83.4%; n=2590), followed by
“INDUSTR Y” (12.4%; n=384) and “OTHER_GO V” (3.2%;
n=98). However, our reclassif ication revealed the strong
presence of hospitals/clinics (44.2%; n=1373) and academia
(28%; n=869), followed by industry (13.1%; n=407) (Table 2;
Figure S8 in Multimedia Appendix 2). Studies sponsored by
hospitals/clinics, academia, and industry have increased since
2017 (Figure 3).

Enrollment (Sample Size)
The enrollment data were skewed to the right: maximum
13,977,257; mean 16,962 (SD 288,155); and median 255 (IQR
80-1000). The most common size category overall was 101-1000
(44.8%). Among trials, 1-100 (42.7%; 497/1163) was most
common, followed by 101-1000 (41.2%; 479/1163), whereas
101-1000 (46.7%; 893/1913) was most represented among
observ ational studies (Table 1). This pattern did not materially
change when stratif ied by sponsor sectors (Table S4 in
Multimedia Appendix 2). Traditionally , the largest studies tend
to be industry-sponsored [23], but this was not the case in ourdata. Among observ ational studies, the hospital/clinic sector ,
followed by academia, represented the highest number of studies
in all size categories, including the largest (>30,000). Among
trials, the hospital/clinic sector represented the most up to the
10,000 category. While interv entional trials in the 1-100 and
101-1000 categories and observ ational studies in the 101-1000
category have increased the most over time (Figure S5 in
Multimedia Appendix 2), 16.1% (187/1163) of trials and 29%
(551/1898) of observ ational studies were large, with enrollments
above 1000.

We also compared the overall enrollment distrib ution (1-100,
101-1000, and >1000) with that of prior reports that used the
ClinicalT rials.go v data (Figure S6 in Multimedia Appendix 2).
First, our data distrib ution was similar to that of previous
research on AI studies up to March 2022 [1]. Second, when
compared to 2 previous reports on non–disease-specif ic trials
(non-AI/ML) during 2000-2019 and 2007-2010, the proportion
of the largest category (>1000) was higher in our AI/ML trials
(16.1%; 187/1163) than in the non-AI/ML trials: (3.8%;
5174/135,144 in 2000-2019 [23] and 3.9%; 1103/28,467 in
2007-2010 [24]). When restricted to RCTs alone, the proportion
of the >1000 category was even higher in our AI/ML trials
(19.8%; 129/653). Conversely , the proportion of the smallest
category (1-100) was lower in our trials (42.7%; 497/1163) than
in the non-AI/ML trials (63.2% [23] and 62.3% [24]).
Sex-Specif ic Studies
The majority (92.2%; 2863/3104) was not sex-specif ic, followed
by women-tar geted (6.2%; 192/3104) and men-tar geted (1.6%;
49/3104) studies (Table 2). Over time, AI/ML studies for women
have increased since 2018 (Figure S7 in Multimedia Appendix
2).Study Location—Global Distrib ution, Geographic and
Economic
The most common regions were Europe (34.5%; 973/2821),
Asia/P acific (29.8%; 841/2821), and North America (25.9%;
731/2821; Table 2), followed by the Middle East (3%; 84/2821).
The most common countries were the United States (21.8%;
677/3106), China (17.7%; 550/3106), France (6.6%; 205/3106),
the United Kingdom (6.2%; 193/3106), Italy (5.2%; 162/3106),
and Taiwan (3.6%; 111/3106). See Table S2 in Multimedia
Appendix 2for a full list of countries, with the World Bank’ s
GNI-based distrib ution.
In Figure 4, 71 countries are color -divided into 38 high-income
countries and 33 non–high-income countries. Most AI/ML
studies were conducted in high-income countries (75.3%;
2340/3106), followed by upper -middle-income countries,
including China (21.7%; 675/3106), lower-middle-income
countries (2.8%; 88/3106), and low-income countries (0.1%;
3/3106) (Table 2). Studies in non–high-income countries have
started to increase since 2020, particularly in Turkey (41 vs 50),
Egypt (21 vs 24), India (15 vs 23), Brazil (15 vs 16), Russia (11
vs 14), and Mexico (8 vs 11), where the numbers in parentheses
represent the totals for 2020-2023 compared to the totals for
the entire period of 2010-2023.
Figur e 4. Study locations (geographic and economic) in artificial intelligence/machine learning studies, 2010-2023. Numbers denote the number of
studies in each location. Studies with multiple locations are included, as well as single-country studies. Studies with unkno wn locations (missing) are
not included in the counts. HIC: high-income country (as per the World Bank classif ication).
As shown in Figure 5, studies in Europe, Asia/P acific, and North
America increased since 2018, and so did studies in high-income
countries, with a modest increase in upper -middle-incomecountries, particularly China. The entries of
lower-middle-income countries (in 2018) and lower-income
countries (in 2021) lagged.

Posting of Study Results on ClinicalT rials.go v
Overall, only 5.6% (47/842) of completed studies had results
available on ClinicalT rials.go v. Among studies with posted
results (n=47), the median time from “primary completion date”
to “results first posted date” was 505 days (IQR 399-700;minimum 93, maximum 1200). During 2018-2022, as the rapid
increase in AI/ML research became evident, completed studies
increased from 55 to 227, but the reporting rate stagnated,
remaining between 5.3% and 7.3% (Table 3). Consequently ,
the number of completed studies without posted results increased
(Figure 6).

AI/ML Terms Used in Study Descriptions
The most frequently used term in study descriptions was
“artif icial intelligence” (37%), followed by “machine learning”
(31.4%), “deep learning” (12.3%), “convolutional neural
netw ork” (2.6%), and “random forest” (2.1%; Figure S2 in
Multimedia Appendix 2). The use of “artif icial intelligence, ”
“machine learning, ” and “deep learning” has increased since
2017, especially the former two (Figure S4 in Multimedia
Appendix 2).Discussion
Of 3106 AI/ML studies over the past 14 years, 63% (n=1951)
started in the last 3 years alone; more than half (56.7%;
1762/3106) have set the primary completion date between 2023
and 2050, with a median time of 7 years (IQR 3.5-12) beyond
2023. Thus, our data indicate the general direction of the AI/ML
pipeline in the years ahead.

In determining whether the accelerated growth of AI/ML
research reflects an increase in desirable study attrib utes or
otherwise, we found uneven growth occurring in three areas:
(1) study design, (2) study location, and (3) study results
availability . First, the increase in randomized (interv entional)
and prospecti ve (observ ational) designs, along with large studies
(n>1000), representing a quarter of all studies, may indicate a
move toward a prospecti ve comparati ve evaluation stage.
Second, much of the rapid growth in AI/ML studies comes from
high-income countries in high-resource settings. Third, the
availability of results posted on ClinicalT rials.go v remained
limited, and thus, the number of completed studies without
posted results increased over time. While the first point seems
promising, the other two perpetuate previously raised issues.
Study Design
Previous research on AI studies registered on ClinicalT rials.go v
as of March 2022 concluded that the proportion of trials with
prospecti ve (59.92%) and randomized (52.7%) designs was
insuf ficient [1]. We also observ ed similar proportions
(prospecti ve: 58.9%; randomized: 56.2%) as of December 2023.
However, from 2017 to 2023, the proportions of RCT and
prospecti ve designs increased by 42.1% and 22.6%, respecti vely,
while retrospecti ve and cross-sectional studies decreased by
11.9% and 28.5%, respecti vely. This is deemed an impro vement
compared to the period when retrospecti ve assessments were
dominant [11].
Although the choice of RCTs depends on the stage of
development, the “phase” data, more aligned with drug
development, was mostly “not applicable” (93%) in our data
(Table 1). Referring to a stage-specif ic reporting guideline for
the early and live clinical evaluation of decision-support systems
based on AI, which compares development pathw ays among
drugs, AI, and surgical innovation [25], the recent increase in
prospecti ve and randomized designs may be a reflection of
enough studies progressing from the in silico evaluation stage
to the early live clinical evaluation stage (trial phase 1-2 in
drugs) and the comparati ve prospecti ve evaluation stage (trial
phase 3 in drugs).
Enrollment (Sample Size)
AI models, especially deep learning models, often require large
datasets to achie ve robust performance [26], with sample sizes
above 1000 being common. This was empirically reflected in
our data overall. When compared to non-AI/ML trials registered
on ClinicalT rials.go v during 2000-2019 [23,24], the proportion
of smaller trials (1-100) was lower, and the proportion of larger
trials (>1000) was higher in our data (Figure S6 in Multimedia
Appendix 2). Furthermore, 16.1% (187/1163) of trials had a
sample size of >1000, 72.2% (135/187) of which were not
completed yet. Similarly , 19.8% of RCTs (129/653, excluding
withdra wn) were in the >1000 category, but 68.2% (88/129)
were still ongoing. Thus, the majority of large AI/ML trials in
our data are still in the pipeline and yet to be captured in future
systematic reviews.
Lead Sponsor Sector
Our reclassif ication of the “other” groups revealed the strong
presence of hospital/clinic or academic sponsorship overindustry (Figure 3). The hospital/clinic or academic sectors
might be more likely than the industry to engage in AI/ML
research even if it lacks commercialization potential. The higher
representation of hospitals/clinics and academia might reflect
a high volume of nonproprietary AI/ML.
The Underr epresented
We examined two areas. First, the underrepresentation of women
in research [27,28] is well documented. In this study , we found
a gradual increase in women-tar geted studies over time. Second,
75.3% (2340/3106) of AI/ML studies were conducted in
high-income countries, and only 2.8% (88/3106) and 0.1%
(3/3106) were conducted in lower-middle-income and
low-income countries, respecti vely. If AI/ML models poorly
generalize to people other than those whose data were used to
train the algorithms, it may exacerbate existing disparities. While
external validation and model recalibration may help mitig ate
health care inequities due to data disparity [14], inappropriate
external validation (and the lack thereof) in AI/ML research
was already highlighted [9,29,30]. Validation using unseen data
is particularly important in models built with single-center data
[31], and most of our sample (77.2%; 2177/2821) indeed
comprised single-center studies. However, external validation
was mentioned in only 47 of 3106 studies (1.5%). Of these 47,
only 9 (19.1%) were conducted in non–high-income countries:
China (n=6), Argentina (n=1), Ecuador (n=1), and Russia (n=1),
as part of a 10-country study (all were high-income countries,
except Russia).
Availability of Results on ClinicalT rials.go v
While the number of newly initiated studies increased, the
number of completed studies without posted results also
increased. The limited reporting of even basic results on
ClinicalT rials.go v contrasts with the rapid advancements in the
field and the registry’ s stated purpose of registration and result
submission, which includes mitig ating publication bias and
outcome reporting bias [32].
Outside the AI/ML field, high rates of results dissemination on
ClinicalT rials.go v have been reported, including for cancer trials
and small studies [33]. With AI/ML research results more
accessible on ClinicalT rials.go v, the registry can play a crucial
role in reducing publication bias, making it a valuable resource
for future systematic reviews or meta-analyses. Although posting
results on ClinicalT rials.go v means disseminating data without
independent scientif ic review, summary results are reported in
structured tables, and the results information is devoid of
conclusions or “spin, ” as the system requires objecti ve data
rather than subjecti ve narrati ves [34]. This allows for broad
scrutin y by the scientif ic community , the public, or competitors.
Although results posting on ClinicalT rials.go v is mandated only
for certain types of trials, all registered studies are eligible for
results submission, and the responsibility of providing
knowledge given the use of human data should equally apply
to both trials and observ ational studies.
Limitations
Our study limitations are as follows. The first is
representati veness. Sponsors of FDA-regulated studies and trials
with sites in the United States are required to submit information
J Med Internet Res 2024 | vol. 26 | e57750 | p. 15 https://www .jmir.org/2024/1/e57750
(page number not for citation purposes)Maru et al JOURN AL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
XSL•FO
RenderX

to ClinicalT rials.go v [35]. In our sample, only 7.6% (235/3106)
of studies were FDA regulated, while 78.2% (2429/3106) did
not involve a US site. When registration is voluntary , it is hard
to determine what the data are truly representati ve of.
Interv entional trials are more likely to be registered in a public
registry due to this being a requirement of the International
Committee of Medical Journal Editors as a condition of
consideration for publication [36]. However, as this requirement
started in 2005 and precedes our data cutof fs (2010-2023), it is
unlik ely to have influenced our findings (RCTs were infrequent
until 2017). Moreo ver, registered studies would be more likely
to share results than unregistered ones, but the reporting rate in
our sample was unexpectedly low. Nevertheless, by evaluating
trends over time under the same representati veness constraints,
we made the best use of the most recent data available.
Second, as we prioritized sensiti vity over specif icity, our sample
may have included studies in which AI/ML played a minor role.
Identifying such studies would have required manual free-te xt
data mining with prespecif ied criteria, which was impractical
during testing due to substantial variations in reporting quality ,
length, and clarity . Poor reporting in AI/ML research has already
been highlighted [8,9], and AI-specif ic reporting guidelines and
documentation standards now exist to increase awareness of
key dimensions that should be described in study protocols (theSPIRIT -AI Extension, based on SPIRIT [Standard Protocol
Items: Recommendations for Interv entional Trials]) [37],
prediction models (the TRIPOD+AI Statement, based on
TRIPOD [Transparent Reporting of a Multi variate Prediction
Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis]) [38], or the
minimum information about clinical AI modeling (the
MI-CLAIM checklist) [39]. The same principle could also apply
to study descriptions on ClinicalT rials.go v, and more
standardized content within the platform would benef it its
audience.
Conclusions
Much of the rapid growth in AI/ML studies comes from
high-income countries in high-resource settings, albeit with a
modest increase in upper -middle-income countries (mostly
China). Lower-middle or low-income countries remain poorly
represented. The increase in randomized or prospecti ve designs,
along with large studies (n>1000), which represent a quarter of
all studies (mostly ongoing), may indicate that enough studies
are progressing from the in silico evaluation stage toward a
prospecti ve comparati ve evaluation stage. However, the ongoing
limited availability of basic results posted on ClinicalT rials.go v
contrasts with the rapid advancements in this field and the public
registry’ s role in reducing publication and outcome reporting
biases.
