8The Research Question
• Critical in the design of a trial
• Types of questions:
– Assessing efficacy of an intervention
– Assessing the effectiveness of an 
intervention

9Types of Hypotheses
• Comparative Trial (a.k.a. Superiority Trial)
– Objective: to demonstrate that a new therapy 
(n) is superior to standard therapy (s) in terms of incident outcome (I)
HO: In= Is
HA: In< Is (one tailed) or HA: In≠Is (two tailed) at 
some minimally detectable ∆ judged to have clinical 
significance
10Types of Hypotheses
• Equivalence (non-inferiority trial)
– Objective: to demonstrate that a new therapy 
(n) is no worse than standard therapy (s) in terms of incident outcome (I) 
HO: In> Is
HA: In= Is at some ∆, the maximum tolerable 
difference considered to be clinically acceptable

The African American St udy of Kidney Disease 
and Hypertension (AASK)AASK Research Questions
Among African-Americans with early evidence 
of hypertension-related kidney disease:
• Does aggressive blood pressure control to a 
target blood pressure below current 
recommendations retard the progression of 
kidney disease?
• Do specific classes of anti-hypertensive 
medications retard the progression of kidney disease?

Design of AASK
• Randomized, active cont rolled trial with a 
2 x 3 factorial design
• Participants: 1,094 African-Americans 
with hypertension-related renal insufficiency 
• Planned follow-up of 2.5 to 5 years  Treatment Assignments 
(2:2:1 ratio of drug assignment)

28Study Participants: Example
• Target Population -> Healthy Elderly
• Accessible Population -> Retired Teachers
• Study Sample -> Volunteer Teachers who 
respond to mass mailing

29Study Participants
• Ideal ‘Accessible’ Population
– high risk for disease
– candidates for treatment
– representative of target population 
– feasibility considerations
• recruitment
• follow-up• high quality data
30Enrollment Criteria
• Inclusion Criteria
– characteristics of accessible population
• Exclusion Criteria
– considerations related to:
• adherence to therapy• follow-up• safety•e t h i c s
31Common Recruitment Strategies
• General mailings
– Licensed drivers
– Voters
– Employee paychecks
• Targeted mailings
– HMO enrollees– AARP members
• Mass media
– Radio
– TV ads
– Newspapers– Posters/flyers• Screenings
– Worksite
– Community
• Physician Referral
• Medical Record Review• Internet / WWW
– Clinical trial registries
– Banner ads
– Social networks
32Comments on Recruitment
• Recruitment begins with design
• Response rate is always lower than 
expected
• Required resources are more than 
expected
• Dedicated personnel are necessary

33More Comments on Recruitment
• Recruitment period is often longer than expected
• Implement several strategies to identify best 
source
• Prepare back-up strategies• Monitor recruitment
–E a r l y
– Often– Locally

35Allocation
• Random
– stratified 
– blocked 
• Non-Random
– haphazard– systematic
36Why randomize?
• Two critical reasons:
– to eliminate selection BIAS
– to reduce/avoid CONFOUNDING from known and, 
more importantly, unknown confounders

37Masking (Blinding)
• Single Blind
– Observers (persons who collect outcome 
variable) do not know treatment assignment
• Double Blind
– Study participants AND observers do not know 
treatment assignments
• Triple Blind
– Data interpreters, study participants, and 
observers do not know treatment assignments  38Masking (Blinding)

39Selection of Groups
• Active Treatment Group
• Comparison Group
– Placebo (no active therapy)
– Usual care (referral back to personal MD)
– Active control group (provision of standard 
therapy)
40Problems with selecting  
active treatment group
• Many Candidate treatments 
– observation studies, animal models, or 
theoretically based
• Strong evidence rarely exists to guide 
selection of intervention
• Dose/intensity are uncertain

41Comparison Group
• Placebo – used in setting of:
– No standard therapy OR
– Standard therapy but risk of not providing it 
is minimal
• Usual care OR active control – common 
42Problems with standard of 
care approach
• Efficacy of ‘Usual care’ often not tested
• Variations in standard of care are common:
– across providers
– between experts and providers
– secular trends occur
43Data
• Baseline data
– Determine eligibility– Describe study participants
– Define subgroups
– Address confounding
• Measures of Adherence
• Outcome Variables
44Outcome Variables
• Principal outcome
– most important variable after 
randomization code
– specified in hypothesis– determinant of sample size
• Secondary Outcomes
– relevant to research question

45Desirable Features of 
Outcome Variable
• clinically relevant
• easy to measure
• little measurement error
–random error – leads to imprecision 
–systematic error – leads to bias 
• masked (blinded) ascertainment
46Surrogate Outcomes 
• Definition: a laboratory measurement 
or physical sign used as a substitute for a clinically meaningful outcome
• Types: physiologic variable, clinical 
risk factor, or sub-clinical disease
47Advantages of Surrogate 
Outcomes
• Surrogate outcomes typically increase 
statistical power compared to clinical outcomes
– Surrogate outcomes
• often continuous• measured repeatedly
– Clinical outcomes
• often categorical• surveillance till outcome occurs
48Advantages of Surrogate 
Outcomes (continued)
• Enhanced power means 
– shorter duration of follow-up and/or 
reduced sample size
– less cost
• Less contamination by competing 
comorbidities if the study duration is short
• Useful in studies of mechanisms

WeaknessesDisadvantages of Surrogate 
Outcomes
• Measurement of surrogate outcomes can involve 
complex, technical procedures
– procedures sometimes new (therefore, 
longitudinal data is scant)
– procedures become obsolete– many technical and analytic issues, often 
unapparent

Disadvantages of Surrogate 
Outcomes (continued)
• Missing values are commonplace
• Missing values result from loss to follow-up and 
poor quality of data
• Potential for bias
– missing values occur in the sickest people, 
sometimes because of the clinical outcome of 
interest
– informative censoring, that is, loss of follow-
up data potentially related to treatment assignmentModels for success and 
failure of surrogate 
outcomes*

The Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression 
Trial (CAST*): Background
• Ventricular arrhythmias are a risk factor 
for sudden death after MI
• Four fold higher risk of cardiac mortality 
among persons with frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs)
• In the CAST pilot study, the 
antiarrhythmic dr ugs (encainide, 
flecainide) suppressed PVCs
*Echt DS et al.  Mortality and morbidity in patients receiving 
encainide, flecainide, or pl acebo.  NEJM 1991: 324(12): 781-8.CAST Research Question
Does suppression of 
ventricular ectopy after a MI reduce the incidence of sudden death?

CAST Design
• Design: randomized trials of
– encainide vs placebo
– flecainide vs placebo
• Participants (n=1498)
– recent MI (6 days to 2 years ago)– ventricular ectopy (6 or more PVCs /hr)– at least 80% suppression of PVCs by 
active drug during open label titration period prior to randomization
Source: Echt DS, Liebson PR, Mitchell B, et al.  Mortality and morbidity in patients 
receiving encainide, flecainide, or placebo.   The Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression 
Trial .  NEJM 1991: 324(12): 781-8.
CAST results: number of deaths 
and cardiac arrests by group
• Active treatment: 63 events / 755
• Placebo: 26 events / 743
p  = 0.0001
• same pattern of results for
– death from arrhythmia– death from any cardiac cause– death from any causeLessons from CAST
• Active treatments can be harmful (one of 
several recent trials in which placebo was superior to active treatment) 
• Reliance on surrogate outcomes can be 
misleading
• The scientific community should encourage 
researchers and sponsors to conduct studies with ‘hard’ clinical outcomes

Examples from the Field
• Surrogate that go in that  go the right direction 
(easy to explain –f it your hypothesis)
• Surrogates that go in  unexpected directions 
(create a greater need for hand-waving and but can still be made to fit your hypothesis)
• Surrogates that behave badlyModel for potential success: Surrogate

Summary of Biological Evidence
• Antioxidants are necessary
• Oxidized lipids are associated with CVD• Oxidation of lipids is reduced by antioxidant 
supplementation
• Does supplementation lower risk of CVD?
– Observational studies

Do Vitamin E supplements 
reduce risk?
• Observational studies are confounded –vitamin E 
takers exercise more, have a lower BMI, eat healthier diets and smoke less often that non-vitamin users
• Observational studies are hypothesis generating
• Surrogate markers are only indirectly related to 
clinical events
• Benefits can only be assessed in randomized 
controlled clinical trialsClinical Trials – Clinical

93Disadvantages of Surrogate 
Outcomes (continued)
• The relationship between a surrogate 
outcome and a clinical outcome has face 
validity but is often uncertain
• Relationship betw een change in surrogate 
and risk of clinical outcomes is rarely knownThe Bottom Line
“Trust but verify”
Ronald Reagan
95Analytical Issues
• Sample Size (Power Calculations)
• Analytical Approach (a priori)
• Intention-to-treat (vs ‘as treated’) 
96Analytic Techniques:
Crude analyses
• Analysis depends on the type of outcome data
•B a s i c  t e s t s
– Continuous outcome variable: t-test
• Examples: Blood pressure, serum cholesterol
– Dichotomous or categorical data: chi-squared, 
logistic regression, cox modeling for time to 
event
• Example: Incident HIV, MI, cancer, renal failure, death

98Analytic Techniques:
Adjusted (Regression) Analyses
• Regression determines association between 
exposure and outcome
• Procedures depends on outcome variable:
– Continuous outcome: linear regression
– Dichotomous outcome: logistic regression
– Time-to-event: Cox proportional hazards
99Interpretation of Results
• Internal Validity 
– conclusions correctly describe what 
happened in the study 
• External Validity (‘generalizability’)
– the degree to which the conclusions apply 
to the study population and other populationsWhy RCTs Can Be Difficult
• Hard to find and recruit the right people
– Many don’t want to be “guinea pigs”
• Greater responsib ility, documentation
• May take years for outcomes to develop• People are free to do as they please 
– Some assigned to treatment don’t adhere
– Some assigned to control seek treatment
– Some drop out of the trial completely 

101Adherence (compliance)
• Difficult to measure
• Difficult to promote
• Must be promoted and measured, at 
least in efficacy or explanatory trials
102Why be worried about adherence? 
Control Active
Drop-In’s
Drop-Out’s
Intention-to-Treat: analysis by randomized group, 
not by final groupings 
103Adherence (compliance)
• Measurement
– self report
– pill count
– blood levels of drug
– biological changes (urine or blood)
•P r o m o t i o n
– exclude poor candidates  before randomization
– keep intervention simple
– respond to evidence of inadequate adherenceHow To Handle Participants Who 
Don’t Adhere to Trial Assignment
• Intention-to-Treat  Approach
– Least optimistic– Maintains initial balance from randomization– Highlights problems from adverse effects
• On-Treatment Approach
– Most optimistic– Upsets initial balance from randomization
– Downplays problems from adverse effects
Because of its conservatism, the Intention-to-Treat approach is strongly preferred.

interpretation Considerations
108

When Trials Are Impossible 
(or Nearly Impossible)
• Adverse Exposures (e.g. Cigarettes)
• Rare Outcomes (e.g. Reye’s Syndrome)
• Intervention Already in Wide Use
In these circumstances, one must rely on observational studies—i.e. 
prospective cohort studies and case-control studies.  When interventions are 
already in wide use, “outcomes research” is a good option.  In outcomes 
research, medical interventions (e.g. drugs, surgical procedures) are 
considered as exposures.  Data on these interventions, and on relevant clinical 
outcomes, are available from medical records and often from large-scale 
electronic databases.110Statistical vs Clinical 
Significance
• Statistical significance pertains to 
whether or not the observed results 
could occur from chance alone
• Clinical significance pertains to whether 
or not the observed results have “important” clinical, research or public 
health relevance.
How To Interpret Negative Results
• Treatment is worthless
• Treatment is worthwhile, BUT study had…
– Bias against the treatment (e.g. crossing in)
– Inadequate contrast between groups
• Suboptimal treatment (e.g. unskilled surgeons)
• Low adherence (e.g. drug causes GI distress)• Controls sought treatm ent despite assignment
– Insufficient statistical power
• Very common cause of negative findings
• Meta-analysis a potential remedy
112Efficacy (Explanatory) Trial
vs Effectiveness (Pragmatic) Trial
• Theory
– Efficacy: What is the effect of the therapy 
under ideal conditions
– Effectiveness: What is the effect of therapy 
under ‘real world’ conditions 
• Reality
– The dichotomy between efficacy and 
effectiveness is artificial
– Broad continuum

113Typical Implementation Units
• Clinical Centers
– recruit participants
– collect data
– administer intervention/therapy
• Laboratory or Reading Centers
– perform assays or readings of procedures
• Data Coordinating Center*
– receive/assemble data– coordinate activities– perform data analyses
