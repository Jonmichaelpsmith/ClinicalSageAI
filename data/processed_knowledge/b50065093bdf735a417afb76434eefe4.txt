METH ODS
Study Design:   This was a fixed -dose, randomized, 12 -week,placebo -controlled , 
double -blind study , with a comparator -controlled component that assessed pregabalin and 
pramipexole tolerability  and safet y over a total of 52 weeks.   Thestudy  provided piv otal 
efficacy  data for pregabalin over an initial 12 -week period that assessed thealleviation of 
RLSsymptoms by  study  drug in these subjects . In addition, pregabalin efficacy  was 
evaluated b yrate of efficacy  augmentation, time to efficacy  augmentation, and general 
tolerability  and safet y of pregabalin and pramipexole in subjects with moderate to severe 
idiopathic RL S over 52 weeks .
Active treatments included fixed dose 300mg/day  pregabalin and0.25 mg/day  (or 
0.5mg/day )pramipexole .  Each active treat ment was administered over a 2-week escalation
period fora total study  duration of 52weeks.  Subjects who were initially  randomized to 
placebo were redistributed to 1 of these active treatment arms after 12 weeks ,and continued 
study  treatment for the remaining 40 weeks.  At the end of the 52 -week ,double -blind 
treatment period, there was a 1 -week study  drug taper -down period.  The schedule of 
activities is summarized in Table 1.

Template version 1.1 Page 5Number of Subjects (Planned and Analyzed):   A total of 1379 subjects were planned and 
enrolled , and 731 were assigned to a study  treatment.  Of those assigned to study  treatment, 
719subjects received at least 1 dose.  There were 354 subjects who completed the study , and 
365subjects discontinued.
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion:   Men or wome n at least 18 years of age , 
inclusive, with idiopathic RLS in the presence of all 4 RLS clinical manifestations ,and 
having symptoms predominantly  occurring in the evening were eligible to participate in the 
study .  Subjects had a history  of RLS s ymptoms for at least 6months and have an 
International Restless Leg Group Rating Scale (IRLS) total score 15 at begin ning of 
placebo run -in (1 week before Baseline) and end of placebo run -in (at Baseline).  Subjects 
had RL S symptoms 15nights during the month prior to Screening .  Subjects receiving RL S 
therapy at Screening had RLS symptoms 15nights per month prior to initiation of study  
treatment ,and had RLS symptoms 2nights during the week of placebo run -in.  Subjects 
with any  secondary  RLS were excluded or with RLS treatment augmentation at Screening.
Study Treatment:   Doses for active treatments were escalated to the assigned fixed dose 
during the first 2 weeks of treatment.  Subjects assigned to placebo received a matching 
placebo escalation scheme.  After Week 12, placebo subjects were re distribut ed to 1 of the 
3active treatments and the dose was escalated in an identical manner to the assigned fixed 
dose over 2 weeks as described in Table 2.  Subjects continuing on active treatment received 
their active dose plus matchin g placebo capsules in a blinded fashion over this 2-week 
perio d.  At the end of the study  (12months), all the subjects, including those who 
discontinued from the study  after being treated with study  medication for at least 2 weeks or 
longer but before the12-month time point, were to be tapered off their study  medication over 
1week as described in Table 3.

Primary :  
Changes from Baseline in RLS symptom severity  using the I RLS total score for 
efficacy  assessment;
The proportion of subjects responding to treatment using the Clinical Global 
Impression –Improvement (CGI -I) scale for efficacy assessment.  Responders were
defined as those who report CGI-I scores of “very much improved” or “much 
improved”;
Rate of augmentation over 9 or 12 months was determined by  the centralized 
Adjudication Board b y reviewing all cases that passed a set of assessment for 
potential augmentation.  The assessment will r ely upon a set of criteria including:
 The Structured Interview for Diagnosis of Augmentation during RL S treatment
(SIDA-RLS) based on augmentation diagnostic criteria established by  Allen et 
al, in 2003; or 
 Augmentation Severity  Scale (ASRS); or 
 Clinical judgment that augmentation might be present. 
Secondary :  
Subjective Sleep Questionnaire (SSQ)-Subjective Wake after sleep onset 
(WASO );
RLS-Next Day  Impact (RL S-NDI);
Limb pain rating using a visual analog scale (Limb Pain -VAS) ;
Severity  of augmentation symptoms using ASRS total score;
Subjective Sleep Questionnaire (SSQ);
Clinical Global I mpressions –Severity  (CGI -S);
Medical Outcomes Stud y-Sleep Scale (MOS -SS);
Profile of Mood State (POMS);

Safety :  
Adverse events (AEs) from spontaneous reports w eremoni tored throughout the 
trial and summarized by  treatment group;
The laboratory  findings data w eresummarized by  treatment group;
Columbia –Suicide Severity  Rating Scale (C -SSRS) w asutilized to assess the risk 
of suicide;
Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (Barratt Scale) w ascollected to assess the risks of 
impulsive behavior;
Changes in RL S symptoms following the discontinuation of study  drug at the end 
of treatment was evaluated by  collection of the I RLS scores at the end of the drug 
taper period at Week 53.
Safety Evaluations:   Safety  evaluations included AE monitoring, laboratory  tests, 
electrocardiograms (ECGs), phy sical examinations, vital signs (blood pressure and pulse), 
and body  weight.  Suicidal behavior was asses sed using the Columbia –Suicide Severity 
Rating Scale (C -SSRS).
Statistical Methods:   The population analysis sets inclu ded:  
Full Analy sis Set (FAS) :  Primary  and secondary  analy ses were conducted for the 
intent -to-treat (ITT) population, which is defined as the set of randomized subjects who 
took at least 1 dose of randomized study  medication and had at least 1 postrando mization
efficacy  assessment on any  efficacy  scale.   
Evaluable Anal ysis Sets:   Sensitivity  analy ses for augmentation and long term 
comparable efficacy  analy sis was conducted on the evaluable dataset according to which 
treatment subjects actually received, regardless of their randomized drug assignment.  
Subjects with major protocol violations were not included in this analy sis set.   
Safety  Anal ysis Set:   The safet y analysis dataset is defined as those su bjects who received 
at least 1 dose of active treatm ent.  
All efficacy  analy ses were conducted for the ITT population.  
Standard descriptive analy ses of the safet y data included summaries of AEs, discontinuation 
rates, concomitant medications, and vital sign by  treatment group.  The C-SSRS was 
summarized by treatment over the course of the study .

Comparability  of Efficacy  of Pregabalin and Pramipexole :  Noninferiorit y assessment was 
performed for the change from Baseline in IRL S total score in the short -term (for the first 
12weeks) and the long -term (for 52 weeks), using both fixed -marg in (Table 11)and 
random -margin approaches.  All comparisons had an upper bound of the 1 -sided 97.5% CI  
below the specified noninferiorit y margin and were statistically significant, except for the 
short -term pramipexole 0.25 mg ve rsus pramipexole 0.50 mg in the I TT population.

Template version 1.1 Page 53Death:   One subject on placebo to pregabalin 300 mg treatment died during study  drug 
treatment due to a cerebrovascular accide nt.  The death was not considered related to study  
treatment.
Laboratory  Evaluations :  There were no clinicall y meaningful differences in laboratory  
values among treatment groups in the median changes from Baseline to the last observation.  
The percentages of subjects with maximum increases or decreases in vital sign data were 
generall y similar between treatment groups, the percentage of subjects with a maximum 
increase from Baseline in standing sy stolic blood pressure (BP) was slightly higher in the 
pramip exole 0.25 mg and placebo to pramipexole 0.50 mg treatment groups, and the 
percentage of subjects with a maximum increase from Baseline in supine diastolic BP was 
higher in the placebo to pregabalin 300 mg treatment group.  The percentages of subjects 
who experienced maximum decreases from Baseline in supine and standing sy stolic BP and 
diastolic BP were lower in the placebo to pramipexole 0.50 mg treatment group, compared to 
the other treatment groups.
At Week 52, no significant changes in electrocardiogra m were reported.
CONCLUSIONS :  Pregabalin 300 mg/day  demonstrated significant improvements in RL S 
subjects in each of the 3 co -primary  endpoints: the difference of change from Baseline in the 
IRLS total score (compared to placebo for 12 weeks and pramipexo le 0.25 and 0.5 mg/day  
for 12 and 52 weeks), CGI -I responder rates (compared to placebo over 12 weeks), and 
reduction in the rate of augmentation (compared to pramipexole 0.5 mg/day ).  Pregabalin 
300mg/day  demonstrated lesser augmentation severity  than bo th pramipexole 0.25 and 
0.5mg/day .  Pregabalin 300 mg/day  in this study  population was shown to be safe, well 
tolerated, and consistent with the known safet y profile of pregabalin.
