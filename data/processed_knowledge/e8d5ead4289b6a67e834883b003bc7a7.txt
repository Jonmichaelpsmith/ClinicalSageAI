 Definitions of terms in the context of the implementation of ICH Guidelines  
 
Term  Definition  Comments  
Not (yet) implemented  The process for the 
implementation of an ICH 
Guideline has not yet started.  a) No guideline exists  or b) 
national/ regional guideline 
deviating from ICH Guideline or 
national/regional guideline exists 
but the process for replacement or 
amendments for alignment with 
the ICH Guideline has not started 
yet. 
In the process of 
implementation  The process for the 
implementation of the ICH 
Guideline has started and has 
reached a specified milestone. The 
process is monitored by the 
regulatory agency and the 
progress is reported to the ICH 
MC/Assembly on a regular basis.  The process can have different 
starting points: a) no 
national/regional guideline exists; 
the ICH Guideline defines new 
requirements and b) a 
national/regional guideline is in 
the process of development or c) a 
national/regional guideline exists 
and is rep laced by or is amended 
to be in line with the ICH 
Guideline. Generic processes for 
a) non -electronic and b) electronic 
guidelines will be defined 
outlining the milestones that 
should be followed.  
Implemented  The process of implementation is 
completed. This step is identical 
to step 5 of the ICH process.  This term refers to the self -
declaration of the regulator 
regarding the conclusion of the 
implementation process. The 
regulator makes publicly available  
the final guideline.  
Adequately 
implemented  All relevant elements, concepts 
and principles  of the ICH 
Guideline  are followed . This is 
done preferably by referring 
to/implementing the original ICH 
Guideline text and/or translating 
the original guideline text. This 
may include in justified cases Minimal elements, concepts and 
principle s will be defined and 
included in the survey to assess 
the degree of implementation. 
Additional information  to the ICH 
guideline  should only be included 
in order to provide clarity and 
facilitate implementation by

a way that may incorporate 
additional information  beyond 
those defined in the ICH 
Guideline in circumstances when 
the Guideline is too high -level and 
does not provide sufficient 
guidance.  
 industry, but should not increase 
regulato ry burden.  
Deviation s or additional 
information to help clarify  
concepts should be  communicated 
(with the justification ) to the ICH 
Management  Committee for 
transparency and possibly 
assessment.  
Not adequately 
implemented  The ICH Guideline has been 
implemented in a modified way 
that a) incorporates additional 
requirements beyond those 
defined in the ICH Guideline 
without objective justification in 
cases where clear guidance is 
provided,  or b) does not include 
all relevant e lements, concepts 
and principles of the ICH 
guideline and does not provide 
any objective justification for 
omitting some requirements in the 
guideline or c) requires 
application of the guideline for a 
smaller range of products than 
outlined in the ICH Guid eline.  Lack of adequate implementation 
means that the ICH guideline has 
not been adequately implemented 
following an assessment of the 
regulatory or administrative 
measure that incorporates the ICH 
Guideline into the regulatory 
framework.  
There may be varying degrees of 
inadequate implementation and 
this assessment can only be done 
on a case -by-case basis. Examples 
could be taken from the Industry 
Survey to illustrate this range. It 
should be noted that according to 
the Assembly RoP (v. 4.0 ), 
deviation from the guideline , in 
exceptional cases,  may be 
accepted if objectively justified.  
Adherence* In its practice, the regulatory 
authority consistently adheres to 
(applies) all identified relevant 
elements, concepts and principles 
of the ICH Guideline over time.  Once an ICH Guideline has been 
(adequately) implemented by a 
regulatory authority, experience is 
gathered on how the regulator 
applies the guideline in practice. 
Adherence leads to a stable 
regulatory environment and to 
increased sustainability. 
Adherence may be assessed in 
regular intervals.  
                                                             
* Adherence at this point in time is defined as application of the ICH Guideline by the regulator ’s view . At a 
later stage, consideration will be given to the aspect of adherence to the guideline requirements by industry ’s 
view .

 Term  Definition  Comments  
Lack of adherence  Even if the guideline has been 
adequately implemented, it is not 
being applied and adhered to in 
practice.   The regulatory authority does not 
in practice require industry to 
adhere to the guideline or does not 
follow the guideline when 
assessing the applications ; e.g. is 
in its practice adding requirements 
beyond what is provided in the 
(implemented) ICH guideline . 
Confirmed 
implementation/ 
adherence  Both the implementation of and 
adherence to the ICH Guideline 
have been assessed by an 
independent third party and have 
been found to be adequate by the 
Assembly/the MC (see above).  The assessment should be done in 
two-steps: first assessment of a) 
adequate implementation and then 
b) adherence to the ICH 
Guideline.  
The implementation should not be 
considered confirmed even in case 
of adherence if there is no 
adequate implementation of the 
ICH Guideline (i.e. where the 
regulatory authority in practice 
accepts submissions that comply 
with the requirement s in the ICH 
Guideline despite not having 
adequately implemented it).  
Not applicable  The implementat ion of a specific 
ICH guideline  is not applicable in 
a country/ region . An appropriate 
justification is provided.  Example: A country may not have 
its own Pharmacopeia but 
reference s internationally 
recognized Pharmacopoeias. 
Hence , the ICH  Q4B Guideline  is 
not applicable (and does not need 
to be implemented) .
