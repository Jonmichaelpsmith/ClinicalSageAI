Abstract
Background: High quality clinical research not only requires advanced professional knowledge, but also needs sound study
design and correct statistical analyses. The number of clinical research articles published in Chinese medical journals has
increased immensely in the past decade, but study design quality and statistical analyses have remained suboptimal. Theaim of this investigation was to gather evidence on the quality of study design and statistical analyses in clinical researchesconducted in China for the first decade of the new millennium.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Ten (10) leading Chinese medical journals were selected and all original articles published
in 1998 (N = 1,335) and 2008 (N = 1,578) were thoroughly categorized and reviewed. A well-defined and validated checkliston study design, statistical analyses, results presentation, and interpretation was used for review and evaluation. Mainoutcomes were the frequencies of different types of study design, error/defect proportion in design and statistical analyses,
and implementation of CONSORT in randomized clinical trials. From 1998 to 2008: The error/defect proportion in statistical
analyses decreased significantly ( x
2= 12.03, p ,0.001), 59.8% (545/1,335) in 1998 compared to 52.2% (664/1,578) in 2008.
The overall error/defect proportion of study design also decreased ( x2= 21.22, p ,0.001), 50.9% (680/1,335) compared to
42.40% (669/1,578). In 2008, design with randomized clinical trials remained low in single digit (3.8%, 60/1,578) with two-
third showed poor results reporting (defects in 44 papers, 73.3%). Nearly half of the published studies were retrospective in
nature, 49.3% (658/1,335) in 1998 compared to 48.2% (761/1,578) in 2008. Decreases in defect proportions were observed inboth results presentation ( x
2= 93.26, p ,0.001), 92.7% (945/1,019) compared to 78.2% (1023/1,309) and interpretation
(x2= 27.26, p ,0.001), 9.7% (99/1,019) compared to 4.3% (56/1,309), some serious ones persisted.
Conclusions/Significance: Chinese medical research seems to have made significant progress regarding statistical analyses,
but there remains ample room for improvement regarding study designs. Retrospective clinical studies are the most oftenused design, whereas randomized clinical trials are r are and often show methodological weaknesses. Urgent
implementation of the CONSORT statement is imperative.

Introduction
High quality clinical research not only requires advanced
professional knowledge, but also needs sound study design and
correct statistical analyses. Yates and Healy [1] once stated, ‘‘It is
depressing to find how much good biological work is in danger ofbeing wasted through incompetent and misleading analyses ofnumerical results.’’
Since the early 1970s, Altman et al. [2–6] have studied the
errors/defects in all aspects of study design and statistical analysesin medical journals. Consequently, a series of report guidelines
were proposed, including CONSORT and TREND statements
[7–10]. These guidelines have greatly improved the quality ofpublications in clinical research worldwide. Nonetheless, theinfluence of these guidelines on the Chinese scientists remainsunclear. Though there were a few articles that had addressed the
quality of statistical application. However, most of them had
focused on qualitative analyses instead of quantitative one, and
were limited to listing the errors/defects in study design and
statistical analyses inclusive. Wang and Zhang reviewed the
published articles in five Chinese medical journals in 1995 [11].
They performed a cross-sectional analysis on the types of study
design, statistical analyses, and made a quantitative analyses of the
errors in statistical methods.
The number of clinical research papers published by Chinese
scientists has greatly increased in the past decade. This research
intends to provide an updated perspective on clinical research in
China. It compared the errors/defects in study design and
statistical analyses published in 1998 and 2008 in 10 leading
Chinese medical journals. A total of 2,913 articles from 228 issues
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 5 | e10822

in 1998 (N = 1335) and 2008 (N = 1578) were reviewed. We
evaluated the study design, statistical analyses, and results
presentation and interpretation. We also examined randomizedclinical trials according to the CONSORT statement. In addition,
the current status and trends of study design and statistical analyses
were discussed and remedies for improvement were proposed.
Methods
Journals
There are nearly 1,100 biomedical journals in China and less than
100 being indexed by Medline. For this research we selected 10leading medical journals publishe d in Chinese, sponsored by Chinese
Medical Association (CMA) and indexed by Medline. The 10 journals
are: Chinese Journal of Internal Medicine ,Chinese Journal of Surgery ,Chinese
Journal of Pediatrics ,Chinese Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology ,Chinese
Journal of Ophthalmology ,Chinese Journal of Hematology ,Chinese Journal of
Stomatology ,Chinese Journal of Cardiology ,Chinese Journal of Oncology ,and
Chinese Journal of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases (see Table S1).
All articles published in these journals were peer reviewed. We
examined all the original articles published in 1998 and 2008. Thereview contents included the types of study design, frequencies of
various statistical methods, errors/defects in study design and
statistical analyses, and implementation of CONSORT inrandomized clinical trials.
Quality control
Rigorous quality control was implemented throughout this
investigation. As to the definitions of different types of study designs,we mainly followed the definitions and standards established by The
Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, Oxford UK [12]. Meanwhile,
considering the situations in China, two new types, namely case studyand case series study, were also included. The standards of quality for
different study designs were derived from the corresponding
statements, such as CONSORT, STROBE, STARD and TRENDstatement [7–10]. Statistical methods were categorized by a modified
method used by Emerson [13]. We counted all the statistical methods
used in an article, but if a method was used repeatedly in that article,it was only counted once. After three rounds of pre-survey and five
rounds of Delphi method and team discussion, a well-defined
checklist with specifications was established (see Appendix S1).Regarding randomized clinical trials, most Chinese medical journals
have not yet followed the CONSORT statement. In fact, there are
only 4 journals have endorsed the CONSORT statement to date (i.e.,Chinese Journal of Evidence-based Medicine ,Chinese Medical Journal ,Chinese
Medicine ,Journal of Chinese Integrative Medicine ). We examined the
randomized clinical trials by several main issues of the CONSORTstatement related to statistics. Twenty-one researchers participated in
this study: 5 professors, 7 lecturer s, 4 assistants and 5 postgraduates.
All of them have received formal training in health statistics and someof them have long-term teaching and research experience. Each
article was reviewed by 3 researchers independently, including a
professor, a lecturer and an assistant or postgraduate. Discrepancieswere solved by team discussion.
Data analysis
Epidata3.1 was used for double data entry and management.
SAS9.1.3 was used for analysis, as appropriate.
Results
Situation of study design
As shown in Table S1 and S2 from 1998 to 2008, both the
numbers of issues and articles in the 10 journals were increased(issues: 96 to 132; articles: 1335 to 1578). The basic science studies
increased significantly ( x2= 10.61, p = 0.001), 24.3% (324/1,335)
in 1998 compared to 29.7% (468/1,678) in 2008. Surprisingly, the
number of clinical trials remained low in single digit (randomized
clinical trials: 4.9% (66/1335) compared to 3.8% (60/1,578); non-
randomized clinical trials: 6.7% (90/1,335) compared to 3.9%
(61/1,578)). The majority of the published studies remained
retrospective, 49.3% (658/1,335) compared to 48.2% (761/1,578).
However, the overall error/defect proportion of study design was
decreased ( x2= 21.22, p ,0.001), 50.9% (680/1,335) compared to
42.4% (669/1,578). In general, randomized clinical trials, non-
randomized clinical trials, cohort study and case-control study
tended to use statistical analyses more frequently.
No randomized clinical trials or non- randomized clinical trials
were found being registered on the domestic or internationalclinical trial registries. Based on the checklist derived from
CONSORT, the error/defect proportion of randomized clinical
trials had dropped markedly ( x
2= 6.74, P = 0.009), 90.9% (60/66)
in 1998 compared to 73.3% (44/60) in 2008, despite there were
small number of randomized clinical trials. Omission of sample
size estimation, failure to use (or report) randomization, failure to
use (or report) blinding, and unclear primary outcome measures
were the most common errors/defects in randomized clinical trials
design (Table S3). A notable improvement in error/defect
proportion was observed in sample size estimation ( x2= 7.68,
p = 0.006), 84.9% (56/66) compared to 63.3% (38/60); However,
more than one-half of the articles still failed to meet this vital
requirement in conducting quality clinical trials. Cases were also
improved for randomization and blinding, but most articles only
mentioned the use without describing how the randomization and
blinding were done.
Situation of statistical analyses
As shown in Table S4, articles using statistical methods had
increased markedly in 2008 ( x2= 35.94, p ,0.001), 68.3% (912/
1,335) in 1998 compared to 78.1% (1,233/1,578) in 2008. In
1998, 31.7% (423/1,335) articles had no statistical analyses, in
which 8.0% (107/1,335) needed statistical analyses but omitted. In2008, 21.9% (345/1,578) articles had no statistical analyses, in
which 4.8% (76/1,578) needed but had statistical analyses omitted.
The most used statistical methods remained the simple tests (i.e., t-
tests, contingency table and ANOVA). Some more sophisticated
statistical methods, such as repeated-measures analysis, logistic
regression and survival analysis emerged in 2008. The error/
defect proportion of statistical analyses had decreased ( x
2= 12.03,
p,0.001), 59.8% (545/1,335) compared to 52.2% (664/1,578).
Statistical methods that had been misused frequently were also
observed in these simple tests. Compared with 1998, the error
proportions of t-test and contingency table were also noticeably
decreased (t-test: 62.0% (305/492) compared to 44.4% (253/570),
x2= 32.83, p ,0.001; contingency table: 48.3% (154/319) com-
pared to 32.3% (169/523), x2= 21.35, p ,0.001). The most
common mistakes for these three methods were using multiple t-
tests for multiple group comparisons, absence of significant level
adjustment for multiple comparisons in contingency table,
ignoring or misusing the method of multiple pair-wise comparisons
in ANOVA.
Results presentation and interpretation
Beside study design and statistical analyses, presentation and
interpretation of results also improved, but serious errors/defectspersisted (Table S5). Inappropriate presentation of statistical
results was the most common defect seen. Using arbitrary p
thresholds instead of reporting exact p values, reporting p valueStatistics in Chinese Med-Jour

without showing test statistics, and insufficient (or inappropriate)
description of methods were common. The overall proportion of
inappropriate presentation of results decreased significantly
(x2= 93.26, p ,0.001), 92.7% (945/1,019) in 1998 compared to
78.2% (1,023/1,309) in 2008; In 2008, using arbitrary p thresholds
instead of reporting exact p values had decreased to 61.7% (807/
1,309, x2= 133.62, p ,0.001); reporting p value without test
statistics had dropped to 57.6% (754/1,309, x2= 74.44, p ,0.001);
inappropriate description of statistical methods was also down to
38.7% (506/1,309, x2= 45.69, p ,0.001). Also, the proportion of
inappropriate interpretation of results was decreased ( x2= 27.26,
p,0.001), 9.7% (99/1,019) compared to 4.3% (56/1,309). The
most common error in interpreting the results was the miscon-
ception of p value, that is when p ,a, the smaller the p-value is, the
greater the difference between groups is. This error was 3.3% (34/
1,019) in 1998 compared to 0.2% (2/1,309) in 2008.
Discussion
Randomized clinical trial is considered as the ‘‘gold standard’’
for clinical trials. To our surprise in 2008, after 10 years’ steady
progress, randomized clinical trials published in Chinese medical
journals remained low (less than 5%). Along the same line, the
quality of study design and statistical analyses of the randomized
clinical trials merely improved marginally. There might be
multiple reasons. First, Chinese clinicians, in general, do not haveconcrete training in study design. West China University of
Medical Sciences and Shanghai Medical University were the sole
pioneers to have offered such courses since 1983. Second, some
better quality research papers have been submitted and published
in English in international journals.
In 2008, Xu et alassessed the randomized clinical trials published
in Chinese medical journal and found that only 22 articles (15.5%)
reached a high quality grade ( $3 points) [14]. Compared with a
failure proportion of 73.2% in reporting randomization in thefindings of Xu et al., we found a lower failure proportion of 30.3%.
It might due to the fact that we selected the randomized clinical
trials with rigorous criteria. We categorized them into non-
randomized clinical trials even they had ‘‘randomized clinical
trials’’ in their titles, if they were indeed non-randomized trials. Wu
et al [15] interviewed the authors of 2,235 randomized clinical trials,
and found that only 207 studies could be considered to haveperformed real randomization. In 2007, China launched a system
named Chinese Clinical Trial Registration and Publication
Collaboration (ChiCTRPC) [16]. Since then Forty-eight journals
have joined, not including the 10 leading journals we had selected.
Li et al. [16] declared that the member of ChiCTRPC will be givenpriority in publishing clinical trials with unique registration number
than those non-members. We strongly endorse the requirement for
full implementation of the clinical trial registration system to
promote the quality of randomized clinical trials in China.
We found that there was little change in the types of study
design in 2008 compared to 1998. Retrospective studies remain
‘main stream’. Prospective clinical research, including randomized
clinical trials and non- randomized clinical trials, only accounted
for 8.1% in 2008. In 1991, McDermott et al found that 35.0%
papers published in JAMA ,The Lancet and New England Journal of
Medicine was clinical trials [17]. Clinicians should take the
advantage of China’s large population, rich case source, broad
disease spectrum, and low cost to conduct high quality
randomized clinical trials. Health policy-makers should proactively
encourage clinical research via randomized clinical trials with
relevant guidance to the researchers to pay more attention toquality than quantity of their publications.As we reported previously, the quality of statistical analyses used
in Chinese medical research has been greatly improved. However,
much more work still needs to be done as point out by He et al.[18]. In the present study we found that articles using statistical
methods increased noticeably and the use of sophisticated
statistical methods also have emerged. This was similar to thefindings of Horton and Switzer in 2005 [19], in which they
reported that the use of survival analysis, multiple regression
analysis, and repeated measure analysis had greatly increased. Wealso noticed an impressive increase in the use of rank based
nonparametric test in 2008, indicating that more attention had
been paid to the precondition of parametric test. The progress ismainly attributable to the emphasis of statistical education among
medical postgraduates in China. Serious problems remained
nonetheless. Simple methods like t-tests, contingency tables, andANOVA are likely to be used incorrectly. As for the defects in
statistical result presentation, even prestigious journals like Nature
and BMJ had a defect proportion of 38.0% and 25.0%,
respectively [20–21]. In this study, we found the most common
defects in presentation of results were using arbitrary p thresholds
instead of reporting the precise p values and reporting a p valuewithout showing the test statistics. Precise p value and test statistic
are better be given at the same time [6,20]. For interpretation of
results, the main problem was that the authors considered thatthere was a trend of difference between groups when p .awithout
giving a thought regarding how large the p value was. Pocock and
Ware [22] suggested that ‘‘trend’’ in this context should beavoided because it implied special pleading even the evidence was
slim. Medical colleges should emphasize teaching of the basic
statistical concepts and strengthen statistical thinking amongmedical students. In hospitals, continuous education on biostatis-
tics should be encouraged among clinicians. For journal editorial
board, qualified statistician should be involved with statuestrengthened.
The journals selected in the present study covered the important
clinical fields and represented the top academic level of China.One thing we should point out is that some excellent Chinese
research papers are published in high-level international journals
elsewhere outside China. Unfortunately, these articles were notincluded. Another limitation is that, due to inadequate back-
ground description by authors or the limited clinical knowledge of
our reviewers, we do not know whether a treatment is based on thedesign of the researchers or a conventional therapy, and this may
cause the discrepancies between intervention and exposure among
reviewers.
In summary, this study indica tes that Chinese medical
research seems to have made sig nificant progress regarding
statistical analyses, but there remains ample room for improve-
ment regarding study designs. Retrospective clinical studies are
the most often used design, where as randomized clinical trials
are rare and often show methodolo gical weaknesses. Absence of
sample size estimation and power consideration as well as failure
in (or reporting) randomization is common. Full implementation
of the CONSORT statement and regi stration system for clinical
trial is an urgent task. Compared with the clinical researches in
the developed countries, clinical research in China still hasample rooms for improvement, not only in clinical professional
knowledge, but also in study de sign and statistical analyses.
Urgent implementation of the CONSORT statement isimperative. In addition, to improve the situation a system
project which requires close co llaboration among the medical
colleges, clinical researchers, s tatisticians, journal editors and
reviewers, as well as the health policy-makers would also be
greatly beneficial.Statistics in Chinese Med-Jour
