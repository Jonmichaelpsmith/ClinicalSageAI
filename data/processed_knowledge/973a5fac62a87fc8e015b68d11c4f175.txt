Abstract  
Objective
Synthesise the published literature and national regulations on 
infrastructure, capabilities and capacities required to manage and 
quality assure clinical research.
Introduction
The World Health Assembly (WHA) resolution 75.8 (2022) called “for a 
strengthened global architecture for coordinated and high-quality 
clinical trials”. For this remit, infrastructure, capabilities, and capacities 
needed to design and deliver high-quality clinical trials must be 
understood and advanced. This rapid scoping review aims to identify 
the breadth of requirements and recommendations for effective 
management of clinical trials in regulations, national legislation and Open Peer Review

the published literature. The findings will be summarised into themes. 
It will inform a framework for the assessment and development of 
units undertaking observational studies and interventional clinical 
trials.
Inclusion criteria
Peer-reviewed literature, grey literature, and national legislation that 
recommends infrastructure, capabilities, and/or capacities needed to 
manage and quality assure clinical trials. Publications authored by 
those who design, manage, fund, sponsor, regulate or oversee clinical 
trials.
Methods
Peer-reviewed and grey literature will be identified through Medline, 
Embase, PsycINFO, and Global Health via Ovid; SCOPUS; the Web of 
Science Core Collection; and the WHO Global Index Medicus using 
specific field codes to increase the specificity of the search strings. No 
date, language, or geographic limits will be applied. Deduplicated 
titles and abstracts will be screened by two blinded reviewers with 
discrepancies resolved by a third reviewer. Grey literature may be 
identified through the peer reviewed literature, supplemented with 
structured searches of Google and DynaMed. National regulations will 
be sourced online and from available summaries. Full text literature 
and regulations will be screened by a single reviewer, with 
proportionate verification by a second reviewer. Data will be extracted 
and coded for patterns in NVivo software. All items and codes will be 
summarised using a thematic framework analysis and identify core 
constructs within each theme.
Plain language summary   
Clinical trials are essential for improving healthcare, but for them to 
be effective, they need to be high quality. Poor quality trials waste 
resources and harm public trust in science. During the COVID-19 
pandemic, many clinical trials suffered from issues like being 
underpowered and of low quality. Additionally, clinical trials were 
underrepresented in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with 
few being led by researchers from those regions.  
 
To address these issues, the World Health Assembly (WHA) and other 
global bodies have called for stronger global clinical trial 
infrastructure. The WHA 75.8 resolution, for example, encourages 
organizations to support high-quality trials, especially in developing 
countries. Understanding the infrastructure, capabilities, and 
resources required for running effective trials is essential for 
improving clinical research globally. This knowledge can help 
countries and institutions identify gaps and areas for improvement.

First published:  19 Dec 2024, 9:729 https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.23135.1  Clinical Trials Units (CTUs) are specialized teams or facilities 
responsible for managing various aspects of clinical trials. These units 
ensure regulatory compliance, participant recruitment, data 
management, and trial oversight. CTUs can differ based on the type of 
clinical trials they handle. For example, different resources are needed 
for phase I trials, multi-site trials, and trials involving participant 
recruitment.  
 
There is no globally accepted framework for assessing CTUs. To fill 
this gap, this review seeks to develop a "CTU Maturity Framework" to 
evaluate national and institutional resources and provide guidance on 
strengthening clinical trial operations. A rapid scoping review of 
literature will inform this framework, allowing for the identification of 
best practices, regulatory benchmarks, and guidance for clinical trial 
units worldwide.  
 
This framework aims to improve clinical trials across countries, 
supporting better health outcomes through high-quality research.

Introduction
Randomised clinical trials have the potential to provide reli -
able evidence that can be implemented by health care work -
ers and policy makers to save lives. However, only high-quality  
clinical trials achieve feasibility, validity, and implementabil -
ity, and hence capacity for impact. Every trial that falls short 
in one of these three areas is a wasted opportunity to improve 
patient outcomes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the  
global clinical trials landscape was plagued by underpowered 
and low-quality studies that wasted limited research resources 
and threatened public trust in science1. Furthermore, both before 
and during the COVID-19 pandemic, only a minority of clini -
cal trials were conducted in low- and middle-income countries 
(LMICs) and even fewer were led by researchers from those 
countries. This imbalance remains true in the years since the  
pandemic2,3.
This has led to calls in the G7 Clinical Trials Charter, the 
100 Days Mission, and the World Health Assembly (WHA) 
to strengthen the global architecture for coordinated and  
high-quality clinical trials. The WHA 75.8 (2022) resolution 
invites international nongovernmental organisations and other 
relevant stakeholders “to support robust, quality clinical trials as  
well as to strengthen clinical trial research capacities glo -
bally, particularly in developing countries…”. Key to delivering  
on this remit is understanding the infrastructure, capabili -
ties, and capacities needed to effectively plan, operationalise,  manage, and/or recruit to clinical trials. The characterisation 
of these resources will support nations and institutions to iden -
tify gaps in their clinical trials ecosystems and define actions  
to advance priority areas.
In many cases, a specialised team and/or facilities, often called 
a Clinical Trials Unit (CTU), are dedicated to the planning, 
coordination, implementation, analysis and/or reporting of  
clinical trials. A CTU may include personnel with expertise 
in regulatory and ethics compliance, research methods, statis -
tics, community engagement, participant recruitment and reten -
tion, data management or other trial related activities. CTUs 
that are a part of an institution that sponsors clinical trials may  
also take responsibility for quality assurance activities. The 
type of clinical trials planned, and the remit of trial responsibili -
ties define the scope of needs for an individual CTU. For exam -
ple, different infrastructure, capabilities and capacities will 
be needed to deliver first-in-human phase 1 clinical trials, to  
lead and coordinate multi-centre clinical trials, or to enrol par -
ticipants and collect data as a part of a multi-centre clinical 
trial. Delineating and describing the range of resources needed 
for different activities can support targeted strengthening of  
priority areas.
Many countries have guidance or requirements for the opera -
tion of a CTU, for example the Pakistan BioStudy Rules and the 
India National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare 
Providers Standards for Clinical Trials Sites4,5. In some coun -
tries, CTUs may operate only when externally qualified against 
a benchmarked standard, for example the United Kingdom  
Clinical Research Collaboration Registered Clinical Trials  
Unit Network Key Competencies and Evaluation Framework6. 
These standards, requirements, and guidance differ between  
countries and there is no globally accepted framework. This 
rapid scoping review aims to inform the development of a matu -
rity framework that supports the assessment of national and 
institutional clinical research resources and plan for improve -
ments to deliver robust, quality clinical trials and strengthen  
the broader clinical research ecosystem. 
As a baseline for development of these metrics, this rapid  
scoping review will identify the spectrum of requirements and 
recommendations for effective management and implemen -
tation of high-quality clinical trials across national authori -
ties and in the published literature. The aim is to capture the  
breadth of unique and overlapping resources, then summa -
rise their contents by theme. We have selected a rapid scop -
ing review method due to the breadth of the research question, 
our intent to map the range and gaps in topics, and our focus 
on qualitative synthesis. A preliminary search of MEDLINE,  
PROSPERO, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 
and JBI Evidence Synthesis was conducted and no exist -
ing or registered systematic reviews or scoping reviews on the  
topic were identified. Our review will identify national regu -
lations and other publications that describe benchmarking,  
capacity, quality, capabilities, or infrastructure, for clinical tri -
als to inform global clinical trial practice. Publications authored   
by individuals from all types of institutions that design,  
Page 4 of 13Wellcome Open Research 2025, 9:729 Last updated: 19 MAR 2025

manage, fund, sponsor, regulate or otherwise oversee clini -
cal trials will be the focus. An initial review of PubMed and 
Google have identified a wide variety of material on these 
topics, ranging from recommendations drawn from a single  
clinical trial to national accreditation programmes.
By consolidating the experience, guidance, and interests of  
the global clinical trials community, we will promote an inclu -
sive starting point for the development of maturity metrics 
for clinical trials units. The methods employed to control and  
assure clinical trial quality have many similarities with those 
used in other forms of clinical research, such as observational 
studies. Consequently, we anticipate that the findings of this 
review will identify key maturity metrics for research units  
engaged in a range of clinical studies which may encompass, 
but are not limited to, clinical trials. The findings of this review 
will assist national authorities and research institutions in under -
standing the critical role of quality in clinical research and 
enhance their capacity to achieve it. Literature from many dis -
ease areas, geographic regions, regulatory contexts, and trial  
phases will bring a diversity of perspectives to inform the range 
of capacities, capabilities and infrastructure needed to plan 
and execute high quality research, with a focus on clinical  
trials.
Review questions
What is the breadth of requirements, regulations, recommenda -
tions and good practice guidance published on optimising the  
quality of clinical trial management? What infrastructure,  
capabilities and capacities do those who manage, oversee, and  
fund clinical trials associate with the maturity of the units that  
support their delivery?
Eligibility criteria
Participants
Publications regarding the management of clinical trials in any 
population, authored by individuals, institutions or organisations 
who participate in the design, delivery, management, analysis,  
oversight, funding, sponsorship, or regulation of trials.
Concept
Peer-reviewed literature, grey literature, and regulations that 
describe or recommend infrastructure, capabilities, and/or  
capacities needed to manage and quality assure clinical trials.
Context
No date, geographic or language limitations will be applied 
to the search criteria. Publications originating from clinical  
trials regulations or experience will be included from a diver -
sity of contexts, including low- and middle-income countries. 
All types of authoring institutions will be eligible, includ -
ing academic, industry, government, non-government or others  
without  exclusion.
Sources
This rapid scoping review will consider a broad range of lit -
erature, including qualitative or quantitative research, opinion  papers, case reports, first-hand accounts, and guidance or rec -
ommendations issued by health or research authorities, pro -
fessional societies, research units or networks, government, 
or other authorities. Primary or secondary reports will be  
acceptable. News items such as journalistic articles, press 
releases, and media reports that do not provide primary 
research, formal guidance, or authoritative recommendations 
from regulatory bodies, research institutions, or professional  
organizations will not be included. 
Methods
This protocol is based on the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scop -
ing review protocol template and adheres to the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses  
extension for scoping review (PRISMA-ScR) guidance7,8. A 
review protocol developed and published on Open Science  
Framework in February 2024 can be accessed at https://osf.io/
p6kyd /9.
Search strategy
An initial scoping of PubMed and Google will be under -
taken to identify articles on the topic. The text words contained 
in the titles and abstracts of relevant articles, and the index  
terms used to describe the articles will be used to develop a full 
search strategy. An information specialist will search the fol -
lowing databases from inception to the search date for rel -
evant references: Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and Global  
Health all via Ovid; SCOPUS; the Web of Science Core Col -
lection; and the WHO Global Index Medicus. No limits will 
be applied to the search results. The databases will be searched 
using specific field codes to increase the specificity of the  
search strings to make the overall total number of results to 
screen manageable given the resources available. The Ovid  
databases will be searched using the title and abstract fields 
for references related to clinical research and trials, includ -
ing terms such as study, studies, and trial; quality and standards,  
including benchmarking, standards, accreditation, and frame -
work; infrastructure and capacity, including unit, hub, capacity, 
systems, and metrics; and governance and management, includ -
ing governance, integrity, management, quality, capabilities, 
guidance, and skills. Proximity commands will be applied to  
refine the search and improvespecificity.
SCOPUS, the Web of Science Core Collection, and the 
WHO Global Index Medicus will be searched in the title field 
only for the same reason, using proximity commands where  
available. The TRIP Database will be searched specifically 
for Regulatory Guidance. This prioritising search method 
and description meets the recommendations by Speckemeier  
et al.10. The detailed strategies are available in the extended  
data.
Websites and reports, including WHO reports, the Office 
for Human Research Protections International Compilation 
of Human Research Standards, and the National Institute of  
Health’s ClinRegs Database, will be reviewed to identify  
legislative documents and regulatory frameworks. A combination  
Page 5 of 13Wellcome Open Research 2025, 9:729 Last updated: 19 MAR 2025

of structured keyword searches and manual browsing will 
be used to ensure comprehensive coverage. National regu -
lations will be identified via the websites of the relevant 
authorities. For screening, the same eligibility criteria will be  
applied for inclusion of recommendations as above.
Following an initial screening of publications, a grey litera -
ture search will be conducted from the sources above, Google 
and DynaMed searches will be designed to identify addi -
tional, unique literature. The search will be conducted across  
i) internet search engine (Google advanced search) and ii) asso -
ciated references cited in identified documents. The eligibil -
ity criteria undertaken for grey literature will be the same as 
above. Search terms will include, “clinical trials units” com -
bined with terms relevant to the inclusion criteria, includ -
ing “regulations”, “recommendations”, “gold standard”, and  
“maturity framework”. Search will be limited to the first 
5 pages of Google search results and the date recorded for  
transparency.
Screening and selection of eligible publications
All peer-reviewed references will be exported to EndNote 
21 (Thomson Reuters, New York, NY), and deduplicated in  
Rayyan ( https://www.rayyan.a i). Pilot screening will be done 
by all team members to develop a sample list of topics and 
content for inclusion or exclusion (see extended data). When 
a draft list of eligible content by topic is agreed across the 
team screening will begin with a fresh list of deduplicated  
references.
Titles and abstracts will be screened by two independent 
reviewers against the eligibility criteria in a single cycle. Each 
reviewer’s decision will be blinded from other reviewers. The  
list of eligible content by topic will be consulted and collec -
tively iterated according to the eligibility criteria as screening  
progresses. Discrepancies in the selections of two review -
ers will be scrutinised by a third individual to make a final 
decision, in consultation with the two reviewers. Where suit -
ability is unclear, the team will include the publication in  
the list for full-text review.
Challenges to exclusion decisions will be discussed between  
reviewers for a final decision and strengthening consensus 
across the team. Reasons for exclusion will be recorded and  
reported alongside all details of identified, screened, included  
and excluded publications in a Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses extension for scop -
ing review ( PRISMA-ScR statemen t) flow diagram8. As a qual -
ity assurance measure, ten percent of excluded publications  
will be reviewed by a second reviewer. 
Full-text publications or website links (URLs) will be 
retrieved for all selections approved by two or three review -
ers during the title and abstract review process. If retrieval 
of the full text is not possible, the abstract will be assessed  
for data extraction. Data extraction
A codebook of topics and categories will be developed based 
on the TDR Research Competencies Framework11. The code -
book will additionally include other codes generated by 
the research team during title and abstract screening. Indi -
vidual researchers will code relevant text using cloud-based  
qualitative data analysis software ( NVivo1 4 software ( Lumiver o) 
version 14.23.3).
Each full-text publication will be reviewed for inclusion and 
data extraction by a single reviewer from one of three insti -
tutions: OUCRU (Vietnam), University of Oxford (UK), or  
Ziauddin University (Pakistan). Papers in languages other than 
English, will be translated into English and the translated ver -
sion will be uploaded into the NVivo cloud. Translations will be 
conducted using a combination of automated tools and, where 
feasible, manual verification. Specific focus will be given to 
three topics of special interest to the WHO team involved in 
this effort: (A) phase I studies, (B) international and multi-
site trials, and (C) patient recruitment and management in  
clinical trials.
The codebook will be used to generate a preliminary results 
framework. This framework will be updated iteratively, and 
collaboratively as new topics and keywords are identified.  
Coding will be reviewed a second time by a second researcher 
or “Code Specialist” to ensure consistency and rigour across 
the analysis. Any coding discrepancies between the review -
ers will be resolved through discussion. At least 10% of papers 
will be evaluated jointly during team meetings to ensure inter -
coder reliability. The process of full text paper review will be 
coordinated, and all activity will be monitored using a shared 
project tracker, which will be regularly updated with progress 
and feedback to the Project Advisory Committee on a weekly  
basis.
Data analysis and presentation
Data will be synthesised into themes by comparing, connect -
ing, and combining keywords and category codes. Data will  
be organised thematically and summarised inclusively to 
present all unique recommendations within each theme. 
Results will be structured into a framework of infrastructures,  
capacities and capabilities for each identified theme. Data 
gaps within the framework will be identified. Data will be 
descriptively analysed by these categories where appropri -
ate. A qualitative narrative summary will accompany the tabu -
lated results and will describe how the results relate to the 
development of a maturity framework for units managing  
clinical trials and other types of clinical research. A final 
report of the structured results will be presented to working 
groups contributing to a maturity framework for clinical trial  
units.
No quality assessment of the document contents will be  
conducted as it is deemed unsuitable for the inclusive meth -
odology applied and no comprehensive system for critically  
appraising this range of literature was identified.

I have reviewed the responses and have nothing else to raise except in relation to my second point 
– the text ‘trials involving participant recruitment’ is actually in the plain language summary rather 
than the abstract. I think that comment would still be worth the authors’ attention, but otherwise I 
have nothing to raise.

Thanks for the invitation to review this paper about an important project. It is clear overall, and I 
just have a few comments for your consideration below.
General comment: I think the theme of risk proportionality could come through more 1.

strongly in this work (as per principle 7 of the new ICH GCP revision). I think a negative 
outcome of this work would be recommendations that say or imply that clinical trials can 
only be run using a large amount of resource. Risk-proportionality is also key to delivery as 
it enables us (humanity) to do more trials, more quickly and more cheaply (I appreciate 
quality is the other important aspect to cover there). In other words, you might give as 
much emphasis to 'efficient' trial management as you do to 'effective' trial management. I 
don't mind what you do in response to this comment.
Abstract: 'trials involving participant recruitment' - this sounds like all trials; could you 
explain what you mean here?2. 
Introduction: 'this imbalance remains true in the years since the pandemic' - this claim 
needs a reference.3. 
Eligibility criteria: I wonder if you might miss relevant information by focusing only on 
published information. You mention the UKCRC Registered CTU Network, and their 
registration criteria do appear to be public. However, might there be other, similar networks 
in other countries whose criteria are not public, but which might be obtainable if you ask?4. 
Eligibility criteria: 'authored by individuals, institutions or organisations who participate in 
the design, delivery, management, analysis, oversight, funding, sponsorship, or regulation 
of trials' - how will you verify this criterion?5. 
Eligibility criteria - sources: 'news items will not be included'. How are you defining 'news 
items'?6. 
Methods, search strategy: I think your decision to have no date limits on search results need 
justification. E.g. would a result from 30+ years ago still be useful?7. 
Methods, search strategy: scoping review methodology tends to include a consultation with 
relevant experts to find additional information/results. If you are not including this, you 
should justify why not.8. 
Methods, search strategy: will you include all countries in your search for relevant 
legislation?9. 
Methods, search strategy: sentence starting 'the title and abstract fields' - this sentence is 
too long and unnecessarily writes out lots of the search strategy. Please consider another 
way to present this information.10. 
Methods, search strategy: 'websites and reports…will be reviewed to identify legislative 
documents and regulatory frameworks'. 'Will be reviewed' is a bit vague, here; will there be 
a search method? Or is it simple 'hand searching' in this case?11. 
Methods, search strategy: recording the date of the Google search is good, but the location 
of the search may affect the results, too. Might you record this as well?12. 
Methods, data extraction: might a reference/link be needed for 'TDR Research 
Competencies Framework'?13. 
Methods, data extraction: 'papers in languages other than English will be translated…' - 
how?14. 
Methods, data analysis: what will you do if sources disagree on a particular point?15. 
Methods, data analysis: 'no quality assessment…was conducted' - why past tense?16. 
 
Is the rationale for, and objectives of, the study clearly described?
Yes
Is the study design appropriate for the research question?

No
Are sufficient details of the methods provided to allow replication by others?
Partly
Are the datasets clearly presented in a useable and accessible format?
Not applicable

I confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of 
expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have 
significant reservations, as outlined above.

1. Thank you for this insightful comment. We agree. Though this is not a feature of the 
protocol, we will be sure to embed this reflection into our reporting of findings and of the 
Maturity Framework in general.  
 
2. Thank you for your comment. We have reviewed the abstract but could not find this exact 
sentence. Could you kindly clarify which part you are referring to?  
 
3. Thank you, this has been added.   
 
4. Our review includes grey literature searches, which allow us to capture non-peer-
reviewed sources such as institutional reports, regulatory documents, and other publicly 
accessible materials. While unpublished criteria will be available by direct inquiry, we 
acknowledge that such data would be difficult to standardize or validate across multiple 
contexts. So, our approach prioritizes publicly available sources while recognizing that 
certain non-public information may remain outside the scope of this review.  
 
5. As a scoping review, our focus is on mapping existing literature rather than 
independently verifying authors’ roles. We will rely on the information provided within 
publications, considering an article eligible if the authors’ affiliations and content indicate 
involvement in clinical trial design, management, oversight, funding, sponsorship, or 
regulation.  
 
6. Thank you, this has been defined as news items such as journalistic articles, press 
releases, and media reports that do not provide primary research, formal guidance, or 
authoritative recommendations from regulatory bodies, research institutions, or 
professional organizations.    
 
7. Yes, our approach is that older documents may provide historical context on evolving 
regulations and practices, as well as be relevant in some resource limited settings.

8. Thank you, as this review prioritizes systematically published guidance and regulations. 
For developing the maturity framework, subsequently, expert input will be sought.  
 
9. Yes, all countries will be included in the search.   
 
10. Thank you, we agree, this has been changed to: The Ovid databases will be searched 
using the title and abstract fields for references related to clinical research and trials, 
including terms such as study, studies, and trial; quality and standards, including 
benchmarking, standards, accreditation, and framework; infrastructure and capacity, 
including unit, hub, capacity, systems, and metrics; and governance and management, 
including governance, integrity, management, quality, capabilities, guidance, and skills. 
Proximity commands will be applied to refine the search and improve specificity.  
 
11. This sentence has been added to eliminate ambiguity: A combination of structured 
keyword searches and manual browsing will be used to ensure comprehensive coverage.  
 
12. Yes, we will record date, time and location.   
 
13. Thank you, this has been added.   
 
14. We have added: Translations will be conducted using a combination of automated tools 
and, where feasible, manual verification.  
 
15. Thank you for your comment. As a scoping review, our focus is on mapping existing 
perspectives rather than resolving discrepancies. We will ensure that differing viewpoints 
are documented objectively and presented transparently in our findings.  
 
16. Thank you, this has been corrected.  
Competing Interests:  No competing interests were disclosed.

The authors propose to synthesise the published literature and national regulations on 
infrastructure, capabilities and capacities required for clinical research. The scope of the literature 
and national regulations to be searched is broadly defined and appropriate. It will be important to

review these critically, particularly in the case of the regulatory framework. A survey of the 
regulatory requirements governing trials will be of value, especially where there is divergence 
even in otherwise similar healthcare economies, but these should be evaluated, not simply 
catalogued. Regulatory requirements in many jurisdictions are too regimented in some scenarios, 
and may stifle innovation and slow development of advances in care [Rule S et al. (2019)]  
 
Key aspects for focus should include examination of the role and practicalities of allowing for 
proportional tolerance of risk, in particular differentiating the widely differing contexts for 
research involving healthy volunteers and that recruiting patients with immediately life-
threatening diagnoses such as advanced malignancy. In various jurisdictions this has been 
attempted [“Risk-adapted approach to clinical trials and risk assessments”, MHRA 2022; ‘Risk 
proportionate approaches in clinical trials”, EU 2017], but many argue that progress in this area 
has to date been too conservative.  
 
Other issues for critical review include excessively narrow trial eligibility, driven by a simplistic 
aspiration for homogeneity in study population, but instead jeopardising the real-world validity of 
results [AACR Cancer Disparities Progress Report 2024].  
 
The authors allude to the pressures of the COVID-19 pandemic on trial design and conduct, and it 
will be interesting to see whether this scoping review supports the suggestion that these arose 
from a deficiency in trial infrastructure, or whether in part they were a result of unrealistic 
expectations and §over-allocation of resource, to the detriment of deferred and discontinued non-
pandemic-related clinical research.

Thank you for your detailed and thoughtful feedback. We appreciate the emphasis on 
critically reviewing regulatory frameworks rather than simply cataloguing them. While our 
primary aim is to map existing regulations and recommendations, we recognize the 
importance of highlighting areas where rigid regulatory structures may hinder trial 
innovation and efficiency. We will ensure that our synthesis acknowledges divergences in 
regulatory approaches, including those that allow for risk-proportional tolerance, 
particularly in different research contexts such as healthy volunteer studies versus trials 
involving critically ill patients. To your point on eligibility criteria and the potential 
limitations of overly narrow selection criteria, where relevant, we will capture discussions in 
the literature regarding the balance between scientific rigor and real-world applicability in 
clinical trials. Regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on trial infrastructure and 
conduct, we agree that assessing whether challenges stemmed from systemic deficiencies 
or shifting research priorities is important. However, as our scoping review is intended to 
inform a maturity framework, it does not fall within our remit to evaluate the underlying 
causes of these changes. We will document reported changes in trial conduct and 
infrastructural requirements in crisis and pandemic situations. Thank you again for your 
constructive comments, which will help refine the focus of our review.  
Competing Interests:  No competing interests were disclosed.
