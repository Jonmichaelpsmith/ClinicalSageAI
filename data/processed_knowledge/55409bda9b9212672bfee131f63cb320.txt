Clinical trials (CTs) are essential for medical advancements but face signiﬁcant
challenges, particularly in professional training and role clarity. Principal
investigators, clinical research coordinators (CRCs), nurses, clinical trial
pharmacists, and monitors are key players. Each faces unique challenges,
such as maintaining protocol compliance, managing investigational products,
and ensuring data integrity. Clinical trials’ complexity and evolving nature
demand specialized and ongoing training for these professionals. Addressing
these challenges requires clear role delineation, continuous professional
development, and supportive workplace environments to improve retention and
trial outcomes. Enhanced training programs and a collaborative approach are
essential for the successful conduct of clinical trials and the advancement of
medical research.

1 Introduction
CTs are typically conducted within a healthcare setting where the researchers are
usually clinicians, being the healthcare system responsible for two missions: improving
patients’ health and advancing therapeutics, often in collaboration with the industry. This
dual purpose of clinical assistance and research requires adequate support ecosystems
characterized by a highly demanding organizational framework (1, 2) that has as a
benchmark the Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) of the International Council
for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use for
Conducting Clinical Trials Guidelines (ICH) (3).
GCP is the international standard for ethical and scientiﬁc quality in clinical trial
design, conduct, and reporting to protect trial participants’ rights, safety, and well-being
(4). On the other hand, diﬀerent regulations on CTs, such as Title 21, Chapter 1 of the Code
of Federal Regulation (5) in the United States, and Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on clinical trials on medicinal
products for human use (6) in Europe frame the deﬁnition of the responsibilities of the
diﬀerent participants in CTs. These regulations emphasize the necessity for clinical trials to
be conducted by professionals who are not only ethically and scientiﬁcally trained but also
well-versed in the nuances of clinical trial execution.

In this sense, the Declaration of Helsinki highlights the need
for adequately trained professionals. It explicitly indicates that
“Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only
by individuals with the appropriate ethics and scientiﬁc education,
training, and qualiﬁcations. Research on patients or healthy
volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and appropriately
qualiﬁed physician or other health care professional. ”(7).
As regulation, complexity, and requirements in CTs are
increasing, support structures and professional expertise are
more demanding (8–10), especially in the deployment of initial
phases of clinical research (11). Moreover, new challenges
such as centering opportunities around people and equity,
guaranteeing accountability, and improving eﬃciency must be
addressed (12). In this scenario, speciﬁc professional proﬁles
are recommended to provide adequate support for CTs, such
as principal investigators, sub-investigators, clinical study nurses,
clinical research coordinators, study coordinators, pharmacists,
and clinical monitors (clinical research associates) (13–16).
However, the literature recognizes that there are no standard
deﬁnitions of the diﬀerent proﬁles involved in CTs, highlights an
overlap of functions, and points out the lack of speciﬁc training
for these professionals involved in the development of CTs and a
standard organizational model for deﬁning high-quality support
teams (2, 13, 17–19). Despite the relevance of the professional
proﬁles and roles in CTs, there still needs to be literature reviews
that address regulations, activities, proﬁles, qualiﬁcations required,
training opportunities, and challenges in this ﬁeld.
As we noted that the aggregate information available is quite
limited, we consulted with Chat GPT-4, now recognized as a source
of information for healthcare professionals (20). We asked Chat
GPT-4: “Which are the main CT professional support proﬁles
involved in implementing CTs in the clinical arena?” (21). The
support proﬁles identiﬁed by Chat GPT-4 are reﬂected in Table 1 .
During a conversation with Chat GPT-4, it came to our attention
that not all of the professionals identiﬁed are necessarily directly
involved in the clinical setting. So then, we asked Chat GPT-
4 to provide us with the outstanding proﬁles of the referred
inTable 1 . The second question launched to Chat GPT-4 was:
Which of the proﬁles listed are the more relevant in the clinical
arena? The top ﬁve proﬁles selected by Chat GPT-4 were: principal
investigator, CRC, clinical research associate, biostatistician, and

the information we had previously gathered from the literature
review, underscoring the importance of reviewing multiple sources
to understand this topic comprehensively.
This paper aims to thoroughly explore the intricate roles and
responsibilities that deﬁne the backbone of clinical trial operations.
It discusses the distinct challenges these professionals face, from
ensuring rigorous protocol compliance and managing sensitive
investigational products to safeguarding participant well-being and
data accuracy. Additionally, it highlights the critical need for
ongoing professional development and robust institutional support
to sustain workforce competence and morale amidst the pressures
of clinical trial demands.
2 Methods
For the initial phase of the review, PubMed was utilized
to identify relevant published literature between 2000 and 2023.
The search strategy involved speciﬁc descriptors related to
each of the professional proﬁles being analyzed (“investigator”,
“Clinical Research Nurse”, Clinical Trial Nurse”, Clinical Research
Coordinator”, “Clinical Trial Pharmacist”, “Clinical Trial Monitor”,
“Clinical Research Associates”) with the following descriptors:
“qualiﬁcations, ” “proﬁles, ” “roles, ” “challenges, ” and “training.” This
approach ensured a focused retrieval of relevant literature.
Additionally, the search included an examination of the
existing literature reviews on the diﬀerent CT professional proﬁles
and a thorough analysis of the bibliographies of the identiﬁed
documents to capture further pertinent sources. This iterative
process of reviewing bibliographies helped to identify additional
relevant materials that might not have been captured in the initial
database searches.
Moreover, the review was extended to examine major
international regulations pertinent to the professional proﬁles
under discussion, speciﬁcally the guidelines from the International
Council for Harmonization (ICH) and key regulations from
European and US authorities. This aspect of the methodology
ensured that the review was informed by current regulatory
frameworks, which could impact professional roles and
responsibilities.
Original documents related to the topics being analyzed were
also scrutinized to ensure the inclusion of primary sources and
ﬁrsthand information, which provided a solid foundation for
the analysis and conclusions of the review. This comprehensive
methodological approach facilitated a thorough exploration of
the professional proﬁles, highlighting various challenges and
training needs within the context of current regulatory and
professional standards.

(23–28), establish that the principal investigator’s responsibilities
in CTs are broad. They include adequate expertise, providing
resources needed, deploying the trial tasks in compliance with the
protocol accordingly regulation and reporting, and guaranteeing
high standards of medical care ( Table 2 ).
In the US, the investigator must sign Form FDA 1572, an
agreement to provide certain information to the sponsor and
to assure that he/she will comply with FDA regulations related
to the conduct of a clinical investigation of an investigational
drug or biologic (22, 25, 29) ( Table 3 ). The FDA 1572 has
two purposes: (1) to provide the sponsor with information
about the investigator’s qualiﬁcations and the clinical site
that will enable the sponsor to establish and document that
the investigator is qualiﬁed and the site is an appropriate
location where to conduct the clinical investigation, and (2)
to inform the investigator of his obligations and obtain the
investigator’s commitment to follow pertinent FDA regulations
(29).Accordingly to European (6) and US (5) regulations, the
sponsor is responsible for selecting an investigator for each CT,
who may further appoint one or more sub-investigators at the trial
site to perform crucial trial-related procedures and make critical
decisions. These sub-investigators could be associates, residents, or
research fellows. However, it is of utmost importance that these
tasks are performed in a manner that prioritizes the safety of the
subjects and the reliability and robustness of the data generated at
the CT site (3, 6, 30).
The CT team is under the investigator’s responsibility. In this
sense, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (28) and the
GCP (3) emphasize this role in the designation and supervision,
ensuring that any individual delegated is qualiﬁed by education,
training, and experience. The CT team is responsible for managing
the daily activities of the trial; however, the investigator is ultimately
responsible for ensuring that the trial is conducted in compliance
with European (6) and US (5) regulations and that accurate
records are maintained. The investigator is responsible for protocol
TABLE 2 Principal investigator responsibilities in clinical trials [adapted from (3)].
Qualiﬁcations and Agreements: adequate qualiﬁcation to assume responsibility, thoroughly familiar with the appropriate use of the investigational product(s), aware of GCP
and regulation, permit monitoring and inspections and maintain list of persons delegated
Adequate Resources: recruiting capabilities, available time and qualiﬁed staﬀ for the CT, informed team, supervise delegated trial-related duties
Medical Care of Trial Subjects: responsible for medical decisions and adequate adverse events management
Communication with the Institutional Review Board (IRB): written approval from the IRB that must be informed of the CT documents
Compliance with Protocol: sign the protocol and conduct the trial in compliance with the protocol without deviation without agreement by the sponsor and adequate
explanations and documents
Investigational Product(s): responsibility for investigational product accountability at the trial site (records delivery, inventory, storing, use and return unused) that may be
delegated to a pharmacist.
Randomization Procedures and Unblinding: the investigator should follow the trial’s randomization procedures
Informed Consent of Trial Subjects: comply with the applicable regulatory requirements and should adhere to GCP and to the ethical principles. Stay vigilant to avoid
unduly inﬂuence a subject to participate, use a non-technical understandable language. Obtain written informed consent prior to a subject’s participation.
Records and Reports: maintain adequate and accurate source documents and trial records, ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of data, tracing
changes of Case Report Form.
Progress Reports: submit written summaries of the trial status to the IRB periodically and when the IRB require them.
Safety Reporting: report immediately all serious adverse events to the sponsor
Premature Termination or Suspension of a Trial: inform the institution and IRB promptly to the termination
Final Report(s) by Investigator: inform the institution, the IRB and regulatory authorities with a summary of the trial’s outcome.
TABLE 3 Commitments assumed by the investigator in the FDA 1572 form (29).
I agree to conduct the studies in accordance with the relevant, current protocol(s) and will only make changes in a protocol after notifying the sponsor, except when
necessary to protect the safety, rights, or welfare of subjects.
I agree to personally conduct or supervise the described investigation(s).
I agree to inform any patients, or any persons used as controls, that the drugs are being used for investigational purposes and I will ensure that the requirements relating to
obtaining informed consent and IRB review and approval are met.

violations or discrepancies (25). The FDA speciﬁcally focuses on
four areas of investigator’s supervision: adequate delegation of
study-related tasks, adequate qualiﬁcation and training of the CT
staﬀ to conduct and understand the study, adequate supervision
and involvement in the ongoing study, and adequate supervision
or oversight of any third parties involved (28).
Informed consent is one of the critical responsibilities of the
investigator in CTs (3, 30). Conducting research is an important
endeavor, but it is crucial to prioritize the well-being of the
participants and to ensure the purpose and risks of the study
are disclosed and discussed with them. International regulation
highlights that the investigator must inform through informed
consent about the purpose of the research, the expected duration
of the subject’s participation, the procedures to be followed, and
any foreseeable risks or discomforts to the subject (5, 6, 31).
Furthermore, it is the investigator’s responsibility to make it clear
that patients’ decision to participate will not aﬀect their future
medical care. It is indispensable to avoid any hint of coercion when
presenting the study, as patients often trust their doctors and may
feel compelled to participate if asked (32).
The literature suggests that informed consent forms are often
unclear and poorly understood by participants, emphasizing the
need for improving communication and comprehension (33).
Even more, some subjects may not even be aware that they are
participating in research, highlighting the ethical imperative for
investigators to ensure transparency and understanding (34). The
investigator may delegate informed consent to team members
adequately qualiﬁed by education, training, and experience.
If present, information related to the investigator’s ﬁnancial
relationships or interests must be provided to the participants
through informed consent (35). The roles of investigators in the
informed consent process are particularly important in some areas,
such as pediatric oncology, where doctors must balance their
clinical and research roles, highlighting the need for transparent
communication and ethical behavior (36). Also, the context of
emergency CTs has been challenging for investigators (37).
Reporting is also a relevant responsibility of the investigator
in CTs (3, 25). It includes reporting of adverse events by the
investigator to the sponsor and the IRB (38), which is required
by the diﬀerent regulatory agencies (5, 6). These reports of severe
events must occur without undue delay as they can aﬀect the safety
of the volunteers involved in the CTs and even the trial’s pertinence
(39). Other reports that are the investigator’s responsibility are
progress reports (usually annually) and the ﬁnal report to inform
the Institution and the IRB (3, 5, 38). Financial disclosures to
the sponsor are also relevant and should be updated during the
investigation and after the completion of the study according to
diﬀerent regulations (25).
3.2 Principal investigator qualiﬁcation
and training
The FDA (5), the European regulation (6), and GCP (3) require
investigators qualiﬁed by training, education, and experience,
although these normative and recommendations do not detail the
competencies requirements. Moreover, the qualiﬁcation standards
for investigators vary widely among countries (40, 41). Generally,European countries demand GPC training every 2–3 years (41), and
in the US, the National Center for Advancing Translational Science
(NCATS) recommends undergoing training every 3 years (14).
The IRB is responsible for reviewing the principal investigator’s
qualiﬁcations as part of the trial application to the IRB and can ask
questions and request documents such as curriculum vitae (3, 35).
The investigator is usually a physician, although other proﬁles
have been recognized as physician associates/assistants (42),
pharmacists (43, 44), and nurses (45). However, the proportion of
CTs with physician associates/assistants as investigators is low (14
in 145.398 in the US 2007–2020) (42), and of pharmacists too (523
in 2009 in the US) (46). Even more, some local regulations may
prevent non-physician proﬁles as pharmacists from being principal
investigators (47).
Successful clinical research heavily relies on education and
training, as highlighted by various studies (14, 48). However, the
relevance of clinical research is typically only a tiny part of basic
medical training (40). Clinical specialties provide a signiﬁcant
opportunity for the training of new clinical researchers. Several
medical specialty training requirements proposed by the European
Union of Medical Specialists include mentions of clinical research
with speciﬁc reference to CTs (49). Recent recommendations to
improve CT investigator training promote using more eﬀective
methods of adult learning and focus on real needs, changing
the behavior of study personnel and considering the potential
challenges associated with a particular protocol, as well as the
most common deviations that have occurred in protocols similar
in design or therapeutic area (50, 51).
The sponsor usually certiﬁes investigator qualiﬁcations before
participation in CTs through GCP training (3, 52). Most biopharma
companies have developed their own GCP courses, requiring
each trialist to attend as a condition for participating in their
trials (40). These programs have signiﬁcant disparities and require
substantial time that often does not prepare clinicians for the
hands-on investigator responsibilities (53). Moreover, the current
content of some GCP training materials is considered redundant,
unengaging, and uninteresting (52). Various programs aim to
qualify clinical research investigators through mentoring involving
multiple activities and clinical departments (14, 54) ( Table 4 ).
Despite these recognized drawbacks, investigator certiﬁcation is
associated with improved data quality in clinical research (55).
Recommendations to evaluate the impact of GPC training have also
been proposed (14).
It is worth noting that participating in a trial allows clinicians
to be at the forefront of a particular area of medicine. It often
enables researchers and their staﬀ to meet with researchers from
the same country or worldwide to exchange ideas and plan future
collaborations (56).
3.3 Principal investigator challenges
Investigators must be aware of their enormous responsibility
as their workload signiﬁcantly increases with more legal,
regulatory, ﬁnancial, and administrative issues (27). CTs demand
strict adherence to the protocol, precise and comprehensive
documentation of clinical care, and accountability for oversight of
all activities related to managing the trial subjects and monitoring

the investigational product. Increased trial complexity is derived,
at least partly, from new designs that have resulted in signiﬁcant
challenges for investigators, including multiple sample collections,
multiple committee approvals, more stringent patient monitoring,
complex drug administration, and multiple protocol modiﬁcations
(57). This has contributed to increased disappointment, less
interest in participating in multicenter trials, and a decline in
clinicians willing to become clinical investigators (27, 28, 58).
Diﬀerent barriers for investigators to participate in CTs have
been identiﬁed as institutional support, infrastructure issues,
staﬀ support, administrative burden, time requirements, workload
balance, data and safety reporting requirements, and dissatisfaction
with ﬁnance-related issues (58–61). Accordingly, to these identiﬁed
barriers, the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI)
Strengthening the Investigator Community Project (62) has
developed some recommendations focused on reinforcement of
four critical categories of site-based research activity: developing
site-based research infrastructure and staﬀ, optimizing trial
execution and conduct, improving site budget development
and contract negotiations, and discovering opportunities for
conducting additional trials (58, 63).
The high turnover of CT investigators, believed to lead to
ineﬃciency, instability, and increased costs in conducting CTs, is
of concern. A study of the U.S. FDA ’s Bioresearch Monitoring
Information System showed a decline by approximately one-
third of investigators submitting a Form from 1999 to 2015. The
proportion of investigators involved in only one trial increased,
signaling potential adverse trends in the clinical investigator
workforce (64), and yearly, about 40% of unique investigators
decide not to participate in another FDA-regulated trial (61).
One of the main operational challenges recognized for CT
investigators is recruitment (58, 65). Some studies demonstrate
that investigators are optimistic and overconﬁdent in predicting
outcomes concerning the statistical signiﬁcance of their primary
outcome and completing recruitment of their registered target
enrollment by trial closure (66). Fulﬁlling patient eligibility criteria
and ensuring no exclusion criteria apply before enrolling a patient
in a study are two of the most common sources of signiﬁcant
protocol violations (24). The main barriers investigators encounter
in recruiting are institutional or clinic time, reimbursement
constraints, perceived risk, and treatment preferences (67, 68).Proposals to increase the engagement of investigators other than
ﬁnancial incentives to improve recruitment have been proposed as
authorship and letters of accomplishment (66).
Recruitment of under-represented populations in CTs is
also a concern, with investigators identifying time constraints
and implementation issues as barriers (69). Recommendations
for investigators to address this issue have been developed to
improve patient communication and provide resources such as
transportation or speciﬁc apps (69). Published experiences indicate
that it may be successfully tackled by oﬀering adequate tools
for investigators and monitoring their impact (70). Some studies
analyze gender distributions in participants in CTs, detecting a high
disbalance with female under-representation (71–73), although this
disbalance has improved in the last decade (74, 75). Studies indicate
that this distribution is related to gender investigator bias as CT led
by women enrolled more female participants (71).
When a physician considers enrolling a patient in a trial, a
new relationship develops between the patient and the physician.
This relationship could conﬂict with the traditional doctor-patient
relationship. When considering the various treatment arms of a
trial (including any placebo arms), the investigator could doubt
whether one arm or the other is more eﬀective (76). The “dual-
role consent” physician-investigators is particularly relevant to
informed consent, especially when they have preexisting treatment
relationships, and present recommendations indicate the need to
consider the ethical acceptability of dual-role consent that varies
with the features of each study. This dual research participation,
when approximates usual care, becomes increasingly acceptable—
even preferable—for physicians to seek consent for research
from their patients (77–79). In pediatric clinical research, the
understanding of parents and adolescents is crucial, and the
dual role of the physician/investigator presents challenges in
communicating the goals of phase 1 trials to families (80).
CTs are changing rapidly due to advancements in technology
and new designs. Implementing these novel CT designs, such
as basket, platform, and umbrella trials, which have become
valuable tools in modern drug development and regulatory
processes, adds complexity and new challenges (57, 81). Innovative
approaches such as blockchain protocols have been proposed to
enhance transparency and traceability of consent, reﬂecting the
evolving landscape of informed consent in clinical research (82).

Artiﬁcial intelligence tools can combine patient data (demographic,
laboratory, imaging, and other -omics) to match patients with those
complex inclusion criteria, ensuring recruitment ﬁtness. They may
help interpret data and transform it into usable insights to improve
patient safety (83). Digital technologies can also improve informed
consent and data collection, including patient-reported outcomes,
endpoint generation, and compliance monitoring (84, 85).
Digitalizing CTs is undoubtedly an opportunity to improve
CTs’ participant access, engagement, trial-related metrics, and
intervention eﬃciency. The use of digital technologies in CTs must
consider user attitudes, practices, expectations, and preferences, as
potential participants may view using their data (86). Investigators
are generally willing to implement new technologies in CT.
However, the use of various platforms, interoperability issues,
limited technological support, and the potential increased burden
caused by them are challenges identiﬁed by investigators for its
implementation in CTs (87). Still, it also implies the need for new
guidance for deploying CTs and new skills in the professionals
involved (84, 88).
4 Nurses in clinical trials
4.1 Clinical trials nurses roles and proﬁles
Although the need for clinical research nurses (CRNs) has
emerged as the vanguard of public awareness during the COVID-19
pandemic, this nursing specialty has supported clinical research for
decades (89). An estimated 10,000 nurses are involved in clinical
research work in the United States and around 12.000 in the
United Kingdom, across a broad spectrum of roles and settings
(90). Independent of the position, the demand for CT nurses is
increasing (91, 92).
Diﬀerent names are used to design nurses dedicated to clinical
research, some related to speciﬁc roles of nurses in CTs, such as CT
nurses, study nurses, research nurses, research nurse coordinators,
and clinical research nurses (93–96). Concerning the job titles,
a variety has been identiﬁed among nurses that give support to
CTs as a biostatistician, clinical nurse specialist, clinical research
associate, coverage analyst, medical data review manager, protocol
interpreter, and rural nurse specialist, which reﬂects a broad
spectrum of roles and positions of the nurses (89).
The National Institutes of Health Clinical Center considers
CRN a nursing practice focusing on clinical research. It includes
care provided to research participants and activities supporting
protocol implementation, data collection, and research participant
protection. In addition to providing and coordinating clinical care,
CRNs have a central role in assuring ongoing maintenance of
informed consent, integrity of protocol procedures, accuracy of
research data collection, and education of participants (96, 97).
Some reviews classify CRN roles in four areas: participants
and managers of CTs, caregivers and protectors of subjects,
coordinators of research teams, and educators (96). In an
international study, a variety of deployed roles of CRNs have
been identiﬁed ( Table 5 ), being the ones more uniformly present
in the nine countries involved, acting as a central contact for
participants and the research team, documenting participant data,
monitoring patient safety, educating participants, participate inTABLE 5 Main roles areas for CRNs and their level of deployment the

the informed consent, assessing, and advocating participants in
CTs, reporting adverse events, and documenting patient care
and process specimens (93). Another recent European study
identiﬁed that the most frequently assigned duty for CRNs
was administering investigational medicinal products, processing
blood samples, and shipping clinical samples (96). Concerning
time spent by CRNs in CTs, patient care is the main task of
CRNs, which includes monitoring patients for adverse events,
teaching participants about the study, reporting potential patient
adverse events, recording patient research data, or explaining study
procedures to patients (98).
The role of CRNs is particularly relevant in some CT activities
that require clinical expertise, dialogue skills, and proximity to
the patient, such as in the deployment of informed consent.
CRNs can assist in designing, reviewing, and approving informed
consent (96, 99). CRN guidance and organizational skills in
communication and proximity to the patient are also relevant in
educating participants about consent documentation and helping
them understand the information on the consent form. This
supporting role for informed consent is especially relevant in cases
of limited health literacy that conditions a lack of comprehension
of CT consent documents, increased anxiety during the informed
consent process, and even the success in CT enrollment (100).
The literature supports nurses’ relevance in CTs, as they
promote an increase in recruitment (101), enhance subject
retention (102), and increase general study eﬃciency (103). Nurses
are also viewed as speciﬁcally relevant in deploying retention
strategies based on individualizing and identifying threats to CT
participants’ retention (102). Some experiences in the UK National
Health Services highlight the role of CRNs in building local
research, changing research culture, informing the communities,
networking, and patient public involvement (104).
Independently of the various roles and responsibilities of the
CRNs, the literature highlights that they must continually balance
the requirements for protocol integrity and data quality with
the clinical needs, comfort, and safety of research participants
(105, 106).
In this plethora of roles, two are the central conceptual
positions of nurses in clinical research: CRN and research nurse

coordinators (95). CRNs, or clinical research care nurses, are
clinical research staﬀ nurses with a central focus on the care
of research participants. They support study implementation
within the context of the care delivery setting. Research nurse
coordinators are primarily responsible for study coordination
and data management, with particular focus in managing subject
recruitment and enrollment, consistency of study implementation,
data management and integrity, and compliance with regulatory
requirements and reporting (107).
4.2 Clinical trial nurses qualiﬁcation and
training
National Institutes of Health have diﬀerentiated CRNs’ skills
into ﬁve categories: care coordination and continuity of clinical
practice, human subjects’ protection, study management, and
contribution to science (108). These ﬁve categories are deployed
through 53 diﬀerent activities, which comprise the full range of
practice of clinical nurses providing research-based patient care and
study coordinators managing studies (108). Others have proposed
an eight-dimensional model of CRNs: care, work-study, expert,
lead, prepare, data, advance science, and ethics (98). More recently,
an expert team has designed a CRN training model based on the
theoretical basis of position competence through literature study,
qualitative interviews, and the Delphi method (109).
CRN was recognized as a specialty in the United States by the
American Nurses Association in 2016, a relevant step that creates
a conceptual basis for developing specialty practice tools such
as job descriptions, practice standards, competency assessment,
educational content, and certiﬁcation (110). In this sense, the
creation of the International Association of Clinical Research
Nurses (IACRN) as a professional nursing organization dedicated
to deﬁning, validating, and advancing the specialty practice of
clinical research nursing focused on “ maintaining the equilibrium
between the care of the research participant and ﬁdelity to the
research protocol ” has been a breakthrough. The IACRN supports
the professional development of CRNs with speciﬁc resources and
meetings (110) and has created a curriculum for nursing school
adoption and integration of research nursing within accredited
programs (111). Oncology CRN has been considered a subspecialty
(112), and some speciﬁc resources have been developed, such as
the Manual for Clinical Trials Nursing (113), a description of
their competencies (114, 115), and a CTs Nurse Questionnaire
used to determine the various activities of the CRNs within
oncology (116).
Australia, where CRN is also a specialty, has developed CRN
standards ( Table 6 ). In Europe, a recent survey has identiﬁed the
presence of speciﬁc educational courses for research nurses in the
majority of countries. However, the length of the research nurse
education and the providers of research nurse courses exhibited
signiﬁcant variation, ranging from workers’ unions to individual
institutions or hospitals. Completing the GCP course and renewing
the GCP accreditation are regularly mandatory for CRNs in most
countries (96).
Speciﬁc CT training for nurses may positively impact their
conﬁdence, ability to discuss CTs, and perceived behavioral norms
surrounding such talks. A randomized CT demonstrated thatTABLE 6 CRN Australian standards for practice (233).

an online video-based educational program increased oncology
nurses’ intention to discuss CT with patients and increased
self-reported discussions about CT compared to a text-based
educational intervention (117).
4.3 Clinical trials nurse challenges
Recent data indicate that the number of CRNs in the
United States is decreasing (118), which is a matter of concern
(119), considering that few nursing schools describe research
nursing as a potential career (111). While it’s important for nurse
professionals to conduct research (120), CRNs may face diﬃculties
balancing regulatory compliance requirements, research integrity,
recruitment targets, and eligibility criteria with their responsibility
to prioritize the needs of research subjects and advocate for them.
More research is needed to address these challenges (121, 122).
Transitioning from nurse to CRN is, per se, a challenge and takes
time. It implies thinking like a researcher rather than a clinician,
adapting to functioning independently, gain and using skills in data
management (123).
The perception of CRNs about their participation in CTs has
been analyzed, concluding that most of them remark that they
contribute to the clinical research enterprise through knowledge of
the research process and nursing expertise in the care of clinical
research participants, with an outstanding role in participant care
and safety (89). Some studies have analyzed the main barriers for
nurses participating in CTs. Lack of knowledge and conﬁdence,
concerns about the skills needed to communicate eﬀectively in
various patient situations, and the need for explicit norms regarding
their role have been identiﬁed as relevant barriers (124). Issues like
threats to voluntariness, measures to safeguard voluntariness as a
time to consider participation, the inclusion of vulnerable groups,
and the questionable exclusion of certain groups due to language or
cognitive barriers concern CRNs (125).
The decentralization of CTs boosted by the COVID-19
pandemic implies a new model of working for nurses in CTs
as home care is incorporated as standard practice. It implies
that digital technologies are required, and updating nurses’
competencies is essential in this new CT deployment model,
implying an added eﬀort (111).

5 Clinical research coordinators
5.1 Clinical research coordinator roles
Clinical research coordinators (CRCs) are also known as “study
coordinators, ” “data managers, ” “clinical trial administrators”, and
“clinical research associates” (126–128). They are not described or
deﬁned in the GCP (129). The Association of Clinical Research
Professionals (ACRP) (130) states that a CRC, or Study Site
Coordinator, works at a clinical research site under the immediate
direction of a principal investigator whose research activities are
conducted under Good Clinical Practice regulations.
The tasks developed by the CRCs may be classiﬁed into
eight domains ( Table 7 ) and are most frequently related to the
domain of monitoring activities, to a lesser extent to administrative
activities, being researcher-related activities tertiary (126). Among
other delegated tasks, CRCs perform site preparation, patient
screening and recruitment, patient enrollment, conduct and ensure
the quality of case report forms, maintain source documents,
and ensure site quality (11, 131–133). CRCs are complementary
in providing informed consent to investigators (134, 135). So,
although the investigator is responsible for the overall conduct of
the CT, the CRCs are responsible for many of the daily activities
(136). CRCs may also help in the protocol assessment during the CT
conceptualization and evaluation regarding operational logistics or
procedures issues (135).
Although CRCs usually work in direct contact with healthcare,
patients, and patient information, in Western countries, their
hiring frequently depends on the investigator and is not linked
directly to healthcare systems (137). In Japan, CRCs work under the
discretion of their hospital and, in general, support clinical trials in
various areas (138).
From the organizational point of view, CRCs may have diﬀerent
levels of responsibilities. Some clinical trial units have established
ﬁrst and second levels of CRCs that are diﬀerentiated by the type of
studies they manage (minimal risk vs. non-minimal risk CTs) and
the kind of tasks (abstracting and screening vs. regulatory and start-
up approval). Others have established four skill levels with diﬀerent
experience and salaries (129, 139).
Some critical elements for a good CRC have been considered
related to the “ﬁve 5 Cs”: coordination, connection, commitment,
communication, and collaboration, highlighting the relevance of
their responsibilities and networking abilities in CTs (136). It has
been valued that CRCs mobilize altruism to deploy their activities,
motivate participants to adhere to study protocols, and manage the
tension between research and care (140).
Investigators recognize the critical role of the CRCs in the
informed consent process, as they have more detailed knowledge
of research-related logistics, such as the duration and frequency of
visits, possible costs, and compensation, and can oﬀer information
about the potential participation requirements. CRCs usually have
more time for supporting information, oﬀer a more friendly
language, and demonstrate a high degree of that may promote
voluntariness (138). CT participants may be more comfortable
saying no to coordinators than physician-investigators, which
mitigates physician-investigators negative dual role (141). In this
sense, CRC’s cultural and racial diversity may facilitate recruitmentTABLE 7 Clinical trial coordinator’s domains of activity and tasks.

CRCs also facilitate adequate billing of CTs. Billing requires
information and communication from many sources that must
be coordinated, and complex decisions must be documented to
avoid common pitfalls covered by the CRC’s role and expertise.
Given the potential errors in this process, a CRC can provide the
right information punctually to each stakeholder to facilitate an
organized and transparent process (143).
Frontiers in Medicine 08 frontiersin.org

Peralta and Sánchez-Santiago 10.3389/fmed.2024.1400585
CRCs’ responsibilities impact the quality of CTs in a relevant
way, and some published audits highlight their relevance (144)
and are considered an essential element for an optimal CT unit
infrastructure. In an Italian survey, more than 80% of participating
sites associated improving the quality of clinical research with
implementing a coordinator as a team member (145). CRCs also
positively impact scientiﬁc output (146).
Diﬀerent CRC workload assessment tools have also been
developed that consider CT complexity to deﬁne the optimal
number of studies to be assigned to each CRC based on its
complexity. These tools consider issues like type of funding (proﬁt
or non-proﬁt CTs), frequency of visits, and number of on-site
patient access and centralized procedures (147).
5.2 Clinical research coordinators
qualiﬁcation and training
The Joint Task Force for Clinical Trial Competency of the
Association of Clinical Research Professionals (ACRP) has deﬁned
core competencies for Clinical Research Coordinators (148). These
competencies are described in a guideline and a certiﬁcation
pathway comprising eight domains. The domains are categorized
as entry-level, intermediate, and senior CRCs. The guideline
provides self-assessment and competence gap analysis tools for
CRCs. The certiﬁcation pathway includes personalized professional
development plans. The guideline and certiﬁcation pathway is a
roadmap for research sites to support CRCs’ hiring, assessment, and
development ( Table 8 ). These core competencies are diﬀerentiated
by the clinical study method (observational vs. interventional) and
are associated with potential utilization and outcomes, including
training initiatives, job descriptions, and policy development (149).
The literature has reﬂected some discussion about the optimal
CRC background. Some consider nurses to be the best proﬁle for
CRCs with the advantage of having a possible dual role (clinical
and CTs support role) that allows them to act as delegates for
the investigating physician (including concomitant medications
and adverse events (150) while others believe that the general
background is considered an advantage (126). Various general skills
needed for CRCs are service orientation, negotiation, management
of personnel resources, and instructing abilities (133).Speciﬁc CT training of CRCs is based on GCP as the
international standard. Although diﬀerent formal programs are
available, surveys to CRCs indicate that these are considered
helpful in the initial introduction as a new employee and for
refreshing baseline knowledge, although experience, day-to-day
practice, observing peers and colleagues, and having mentors are
the essential elements to learning (151). Formal training in GCP
can improve protocol adherence and clinical trial quality, and one
retrospective study data indicates that the number of protocol
deviations was signiﬁcantly lower if the CRCs were certiﬁed in GCP
(152). Also, educating and training senior CRCs of new teams is
considered necessary (2).
Diﬀerent tools for competency self-assessment have been
developed as the various versions of the Competency Index
for Clinical Research Professionals, with excellent psychometric
properties and a good ability to distinguish between experienced
and non-experienced CRCs (153).
5.3 Clinical research coordinator
challenges
Despite CRCs’ recognized role in CT deployment, some
discussions have been opened about their invisible role, and they
have sometimes been referred to as “phantom investigators” (145).
This is due, at least in part, to the fact that speciﬁc certiﬁcations
infrequently recognize the CRC professional proﬁle (129), and no
formal CRC position exists in institutions’ staﬀ, as required by
national healthcare workforce regulations (127). For example, in
the United States, the Bureau of Labor Statistics does not recognize
CRCs (129). However, the demand growth in the market research
management of CRCs is objectively relevant (154).
Also, some studies reﬂect CRC’s inadequate professional
identity, suboptimal remuneration, and lack of peer support
and recognition (155). CRCs’ job satisfaction and retention have
been issues of discussion as turnover is relatively high and
impacts productivity and emotional costs. An adequate salary,
greater respect, collaboration, and engagement from the principal
investigator are signiﬁcantly associated with higher retention (155,
156). Over-delegation of responsibilities and under-supervision to
CRCs is another issue of discussion identiﬁed in warning letters

of the regulatory agencies (156). In this frame, some have warned
about the risk of high turnover, lack of identity of job description,
and lack of institutional support (157).
Some proposals for clarifying the competencies for speciﬁc
clinical research roles have been established by the Special
Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR)
of the World Health Organization (158) and by the Multi-Regional
CTs Center at Harvard University (13). As the CRC job is not
well delineated and competencies are increasingly broad, diﬃculties
have been described in its recruitment, due at least in part to
its description in job oﬀers. A guideline for human resources
units recruiting CRCs has been elaborated to overcome this
barrier (139).
Several challenges for the CRCs in CTs are related to
recruitment, speciﬁcally in racial and ethnic minorities. Fronting to
this population implies overcoming language and cultural barriers
and emotional challenges associated with requesting participation
from seriously ill patients. Adaptive and technical strategies to
improve recruitment of underrepresented CT participants from the
CRCs’ point of view have also been identiﬁed (159).
CRCs’ burnout is a concern (160). Causes for CRCs’ burnout
are diverse and associated with job dissatisfaction, perceived daily
work overload, low endurance, and nurturance personality traits.
As the burnout risk of CRCs has been identiﬁed with high rates
accordingly, some studies about some team-based interventions
have been developed demonstrating that they are aﬀordable with
good results (139, 161).
6 Clinical trial pharmacist
6.1 Clinical trial pharmacists roles and
proﬁles
CT pharmacists have diﬀerentiating roles and expertise that
impact the organization and activities of CTs (162). Some
speciﬁcations about the pharmacist’s responsibilities in CTs are
described in the GCP (3), which deﬁnes the need for dispensing
records kept at the pharmacy and notes that an investigator
should delegate responsibility for the storage and accountability
of investigational products to an appropriate pharmacist. In the
United States, the Code of Federal Regulations deﬁnes issues related
to investigational product management (163).
Pharmacists CT support is usually provided by an
investigational drug research service (clinical research pharmacy)
that can be a small-scale operation with a part-time pharmacist
or a large-scale operation with a team of dedicated clinical
research pharmacists, technicians, and coordinators. Usually, it
is a component of a more prominent pharmacy organization,
such as a hospital pharmacy (162). Speciﬁc investigational
drug service pharmacists are present in many centres (164),
and the literature highlights that investigational drug service
management is especially relevant in supporting early-phase CTs
(165). Guidelines (162), best practices standards (165, 166), and
frameworks (164) for investigational drug services provided by
pharmacists have been published, making medication management
a central issue of their tasks.The Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia (166) deﬁnes
standard roles ( Table 9 ), services ( Table 10 ), and the following
objectives for investigational drug research services:
Provide safe and ethical use of investigational products by
ensuring they are appropriate for use and are procured,
handled, stored, and used safely and correctly.
Apply the principles of best pharmacy practice to evaluate new
investigational products or medicines.
Ensure that the pharmacy aspects of investigational product
use comply with relevant legislation, standards, guidelines, and
local or institutional policies.
Consider the safety and welfare of participants and the
protection of their legal and ethical rights, including
conﬁdentiality and privacy.
Diﬀerentiating requirements for investigational drug research
services according to the complexity of the supported CTs has been
proposed. For example, for ﬁrst-in-human CTs, adaptive trials, and
multidrug regimens that have a high risk for adverse events or
drug–drug interactions, high standards have been recommended.
These imply the needing for an on-call investigational drug service
pharmacist to conduct concomitant medication reviews, assess
potential drug–drug interactions, monitor renal or hepatic function
as a basis for dose adjustment, deliver initial patient education on
the investigational drug, and advise patients on any necessary dose
modiﬁcations (164).
Some of the CT pharmacist’s roles are speciﬁc to investigational
drug services such as frozen storage, drug accountability,
expiration date tracking, manufacturing, compounding, labelling,
blinding of investigational drugs, subject and patient training,
dispensing and dosing, monitoring drug events, importation
and distribution of investigational medicine material, and
maintaining written and up-to-date Standard Operating
Procedures for the handling of investigational products (164–
169). However, other pharmacists’ roles may overlap with other
CT support proﬁles, such as CT design, protocol development,
volunteers’ recruitment, adverse drug reaction reporting, data
collection and analysis, education, ﬁnancial management, or IRB
participation (170, 171).

In a national survey developed in the United States, 26
pharmacy services supported cancer CTs over 61 centres.
Services were classiﬁed as pretrial implementation support,
trial implementation support, patient medication proﬁle review,
medication therapy engagement, medication therapy management,
and miscellaneous. The most common pharmacy-performed
services (over 60% of respondents) were a clinical review of
investigational drug prescribed orders before dispensing, the
recommendation for dose adjustments, a review of trial protocol for
scientiﬁc merit, the development of training material for research
staﬀ, and pharmacist IRB membership. The least frequently
performed services (under 10% of respondents) were presenting
or publishing trial ﬁndings, serving as study co-investigator,
consenting patients for trial participation, and serving as principal
investigator (172).
The potential impact of pharmacists in CTs is relevant in
the medication reconciliation process and especially in identifying
protocol-prohibited concomitant medications (173). Despite the

Management of the ﬁnancial aspects of the CTrecognized role of pharmacists in drug interaction screening during
eligibility assessment, they are only sometimes involved in this
phase. However, pharmacists were more frequently involved in
drug interaction screening for enrolled patients with medication
changes (174, 175).
During a patient’s CT participation, pharmacists can create
a personalized ‘concomitant medication review guide’ in table
presentation. This guide can assist other clinicians in preventing
and assessing drug-drug interactions by listing critical medication-
use information (176). This has been considered of particular
relevance in CTs as blind study participants to treatment groups
impact product appearance and packaging, lacking diﬀerentiating
features such as colour or font, being necessary, including a
warning about investigational use (168).
The comprehensive medication review, and speciﬁcally the
resolution of drug–drug interactions, for participants in oncology
CTs has been considered crucial as nearly 70% of the patients may
have drug interactions (176, 177). The relevance of this role is
reinforced by the fact that frequently the CTs protocols do not
asses adequately the interactions (178) and that patients enrolling
in CTs often require medication changes to meet eligibility
requirements (177).
In IRB participation, pharmacists add complementary relevant
expertise (162, 179). For example, in the protocol design, a
pharmacist may deﬁne the parts related to drug information
and medication management, including investigational drug
management. This would cover the drug information section of
the research protocol, as well as the assessment of the informed
consent form for appropriate language on beneﬁts and hazards
related to adverse drug reactions, drug information supplements,
patient logs, or other adherence procedures. In the review of
the protocol for the IRB, pharmacists have speciﬁc training
to evaluate the quality and practicability of the drug supply
management, administration, and dosing strategy, the pertinence
of additional regulatory requirements (e.g., Risk Evaluation and
Mitigation Strategy programs), and medication safety strategies
(165, 179, 180).
Pharmacists may also participate in the screening, assessing,
and recruiting volunteers in CTs (181–185). Several experiences
involving pharmacists in managing patients in clinical research in
primary care have been communicated, with studies focused on
pharmacological treatment of acute low back pain (181), preventive
intervention of cardiovascular events (185), atrial ﬁbrillation
screening (183), and assessing outcomes of enhanced chronic
disease care through patient education (186).
The beneﬁts of pharmacist participation in CTs have been
described. Diﬀerent surveys indicate that pharmacists consider
that their participation in CTs implies improved relationships
and communication with other healthcare professionals, enhanced
training and knowledge, exploration of personal interests, and
development of the pharmacy profession (172, 187, 188).
New models of work using remote communication workﬂows
have implied readaptation of the investigational drug services. Site
qualiﬁcation visits, site initiation visits, sponsor monitoring visits
during a clinical trial, mailing of oral investigational products to
patients, and virtual sponsor audits have been widely implemented
following the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic
outbreak and are now standards. Its use must be adapted to the
characteristics of each CT and patient (163).

6.2 Clinical trial pharmacists qualiﬁcation
and training
Speciﬁc certiﬁcations for clinical trial pharmacists are less
abundant than other CT support proﬁles (189). The American
Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHSP) has deﬁned ﬁve
required competency areas, 14 goals, 51 objectives, and 305 criteria
for investigational drugs services and research pharmacy residence
programs ( Table 11 ). This program deﬁnes the 69 key topics
designed to provide comprehensive training for the residents
across a spectrum of research concepts, regulatory requirements,
performance measures, information technology, and leadership
principles (190, 191).
Accordingly, several programs focused on Investigational
Drugs & Research pharmacy residency training have been
developed, some accredited by reference associations such as
the ASHSP. The training program requires at least 3,000 h of
fellowship devoted to research-related activities over 2 years.
Detailed information about the research pharmacy residency in
reference hospitals is accessible (192, 193).
6.3 Clinical trial pharmacists challenges
Implementing investigational drug services and high-quality
drug management in CTs implies a comprehensive approach.
It needs to provide adequate resources and implement detailed
processes that involve computer software, barcoding, expiration
date tracking, order templates, clinical decision support, and
pharmacy-independent double checks at the point of dispensing,in addition to many of the legal and accreditation requirements
already mentioned (165).
One of the main concerns for CT pharmacists is medication
safety. Safe practices in medication management in CTs have not
been standardized, and several areas of the operative medication-
use process may pose speciﬁc safety risks during clinical research.
For example, the repackaging process implies contamination risks.
Storing investigational drugs may require particular facilities as
they must be separated by protocol and strength to reduce the risk
of incorrect product selection during dispensing (165, 168).
Perceptions toward practice-based research of pharmacists
have also been analyzed in the literature, showing a consistently
high degree of interest in research in general, with percentages of
70–87%. However, studies show high variability in the proportion
of pharmacists who had experience with practice-based research
(30–77%) and were conﬁdent they could conduct practice-based
research (34–73%) (172, 188). Diﬀerent surveys indicate that the
main barriers identiﬁed are low research training and management
priority, lack of funding, time, resources, and culture, as well as
opportunities and awareness of opportunities (172, 187, 188).
Although not speciﬁc to CTs, deploying computerized provider
order entry systems is complex. It implies a straight collaboration
framework with clinicians to contribute to the safer use of
medications (194). Integrating electronic health records in CTs can
increase generalizability, reduce costs and time, expand the research
ﬁelds, and associate with various stakeholder beneﬁts (195).
However, it poses signiﬁcant challenges, including infrastructure
costs, interoperability, standardization, data quality, ethics, privacy,
and data security considerations. The implementation involves
diﬀerent stakeholders in the healthcare arena, CT pharmacists
being one essential (196).

3D printing helps facilitate rapid CT prototyping, automate
compounding processes in pharmacies, and ensure precise dosages
and drug combinations while enhancing precision, eﬃciency,
and patient safety (197, 198). However, there are still obstacles,
such as regulatory considerations, material selection, and quality
control. Despite these challenges, 3D printing is a promising
technology that can revolutionize pharmaceutical innovation due
to ongoing advancements.
7 Clinical trial monitor
7.1 Clinical trial monitors proﬁle and roles
The CT monitor (or clinical research associate) is responsible
for overseeing the progress of a CT and ensuring that it is
conducted, recorded, and reported according to the protocol,
standard operation procedures, GCP (3), and the Medicines for
Human Use Regulations (199). GCP (3) explicitly states that the
sponsor should appoint monitors according to the extent and
nature of monitoring based on considerations such as the objective,
purpose, design, complexity, blinding, size, and endpoints of CTs.
Information about monitoring principles and diﬀerent
guidance are available on the websites of the leading international
regulatory agencies such as the European Medicines Agency,
FDA, Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency,
or other research or research supporting institutions such as
CTs Transformation Initiative, Health Research Authority,
International Council for Harmonisation of Technical
Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, National
Institute for Health Research, TransCelerate Biopharma Inc or UK
Trial Manager Network (199).
Five main purposes have been deﬁned for CT monitors: that
the rights and well-being of the human subjects are protected,
the reported trial data are accurate, complete, and veriﬁable
from source documents, the conduct of the trial is following
the currently approved protocol/amendment(s), GCP and the
applicable regulatory requirements, improve the way the trial is
running and prevention of pitfalls (3, 199, 200). According to
GCP (3), these ﬁve aims are deployed in a list of responsibilities
(Table 12 ).
In daily life, monitoring activity requires deploying all the
skills related to the diﬀerent roles they are involved in, such
as trainers, planners, trouble-shooters, negotiators, detectives, or
psychologists (201). Some of the speciﬁc tasks of the monitor
during the initial CT visit include determining whether the
administrative ﬁle is complete and in order, checking that the
protocol is signed, and attaching the investigator’s curriculum vitae.
After this initial step, the monitor ensures the application and
respect of good clinical practices, particularly strict adherence to the
protocol, reviews the trial data after having consulted the clinical
ﬁles, checks their authenticity and coherence, determines that the
randomization order has been respected, assures the providing
of the necessary products to the investigator for conducting the
trial such as drug packages and materials for biological assays,
and ensures that communication is maintained throughout the
trial (200, 202–204).Each described CT monitor responsibility is deployed
according to standard operating procedures that itemize every
task that must be deployed. For example, pharmacy monitoring
includes documentation and delegation log review, protocol and
SOP compliance, investigational medicinal product storage check,
labelling expiry dates randomization, accountability, and breaking
blind procedure, and each of these elements includes detailed
activities (200, 205).
Planning is a relevant issue related to monitoring activities.
A monitoring plan is a relevant part of the activity to ensure optimal
monitoring of the CT, according to the speciﬁc risks to human
subject protection and data integrity of each CT. The plan should
describe the monitoring strategy, the responsibilities of all parties
involved, the diﬀerent monitoring methods, and the rationale for
their use. The plan should also emphasize monitoring critical data
and processes (3).
Although the monitors are external to the organizations, they
must have direct access to the original medical records of the
trial subjects to verify the trial procedures and/or data (199). This
must be done without violating the subject’s conﬁdentiality, to
the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations, and the
subject must authorize such access by signing a written informed
consent form (3).
The cost of monitoring is relevant. It has been estimated
that the average cost per site visit of a monitor in an oncology
CT is around 1.500$ (206), and about 25% of the cost of a CT
is occasioned by on-site monitoring activities (207). Monitoring
activity before, during, and after the CTs is usually developed on-
site. However, central monitoring is also an option for speciﬁc
circumstances considering each CT’s objective, purpose, design,
complexity, blinding, size, and endpoints (3).
7.2 Clinical trial monitor qualiﬁcation and
training
The Association of Clinical Research Professionals (ACRP)
has deﬁned a Core Competency Framework for Clinical Study
Monitoring with four diﬀerent levels (entry-level, intermediate,
senior, and clinical lead), which include domain, competency, and
expectation ( Table 13 ). More deeply considered issues are related to
managing conﬁdential information, the informed consent process,
and the need to communicate with the team’s participants in the
CTs (130).
Indeed, becoming a clinical trial monitor does not necessarily
require formal education, as various pathways are available for
anyone with a high school diploma or higher (208). Information
concerning the academic background of the monitors is limited.
In a Children’s Oncology Group report from the National Cancer
Institute (209) that analyzed the cause of turnover in a survey of
over 456 monitors, the level of education was a bachelor’s degree at
47% and a graduate degree at 28% (210).
Despite the absence of a certiﬁcation requirement, obtaining
certiﬁcation in the United States can oﬀer more job prospects
and even higher salaries (210). Various training programs for
clinical trial monitor training are available (211, 212). The

applicable regulatory requirement(s), and that the investigator and the investigator’s trial staﬀ are adequately informed about the trial.
Verifying that the investigator’s trial staﬀ are performing the speciﬁed trial functions, enrolling only eligible subjects, and providing all the required reports, notiﬁcations,
applications, and submissions, and that these documents are accurate, complete, timely, legible, dated, and identify the trial.
Reporting the subject recruitment rate.
Verifying that source documents are accurate and complete, and kept up-to-date and maintained and the accuracy and completeness of the CRF entries, source documents
and other trial-related records against each other.
Informing the investigator of any CRF entry error, omission, or illegibility.
Determining whether all adverse events are appropriately reported.
Determining whether the investigator is maintaining the essential documents.
Communicating deviations from the protocol, to the investigator and taking appropriate action designed to prevent recurrence of the detected deviations.
Clinical Research Professionals Society (CCRPS) (215), among
others, provide certiﬁcations. Also, diﬀerent University programs
are available (208).
Updated statistics from the United States indicate that the
average salary of a clinical trial monitor is $73,700/year (216).
A senior clinical trial monitor (minimum 2 years of clinical
monitoring experience, remote work) is around $ 120.000–135.000
per year, and some employment oﬀers include a beneﬁts package
and an annual performance bonus. A lead clinical trial monitor
reaches salaries (accordingly published oﬀers in the United States)
of around $150.000–170.000/year (217).
7.3 Clinical trial monitor challenges
There is a growing concern about the eﬀectiveness and
eﬃciency of monitoring practices and a need for empirical
evidence to determine which practices best achieve the goals of
trial monitoring. Risk-based monitoring has been proposed as an
eﬃcient way to cover most of the activities developed by on-site
monitoring or even detect ﬂaws better and sooner than on-site
monitoring (177, 178, 218, 219). Risk-based monitoring combines
centralized follow-up for most of the reviews and on-site for further
support and has been studied with results that suggest that it
improves data quality regarding data points of major importance
TABLE 13 Core competency framework for clinical study
monitoring (130).
Ethical and Participant Safety Considerations
Medicines Development and Regulation
CT Operations (GCPs)
Study and Site Management
Data Management and Informatics
Leadership and Professionalism
Communication and Teamworkto trial outcomes, eﬃcacy, and signiﬁcant safety requiring less
than 50% of extensive on-site monitoring resources (204, 219–222).
Based on this data, international recommendations promote risk-
based monitoring (3, 223, 224), although most small single-site
academic studies apply traditional approaches (91, 221, 225).
CT monitor turnovers are high, and data from diﬀerent
countries indicate that the percentage of annual turnover in 2015–
2019 was around 25% due at least in part to a low salary,
unmanageable workload, lack of career advancement, and limited
research commitment from the medical team (226). The main
factors considered to monitor for staying in their jobs are a
supportive principal investigator and satisfaction working with
colleagues (209).
The CT monitor position and adaptation capability are
recognized as valuable. On the other hand, CT monitor are
motivated and excited about how they can contribute to the health
and well-being of others and their career by rapidly learning
critical skills and fast adaptation capabilities. During the COVID-
19 pandemic, a rapid transition to decentralizing to monitoring
activity has occurred (227). In this scenario, companies are creating
retention programs focused on building more connections among
professionals and reducing “travel fatigue”, creating a professional
pathway and annual incentives (226).
While CT monitors currently play a crucial role in healthcare,
their importance is projected to diminish in centralized models
where patients can provide much of the necessary information
directly and through electronic health records in an automated
way. Wearables have immense potential for automated patient
monitoring and will be an integral part of the future of healthcare
models alongside CT monitoring (228).
8 Conclusion
CTs are becoming increasingly complex and require trained
teams of expert professionals to support various activities with
maximum rigor, adhering to ethical and technical international
requirements. Healthcare professionals, including principal
Frontiers in Medicine 14 frontiersin.org
fmed-11-1400585 May 29, 2024 Time: 15:24 # 15
Peralta and Sánchez-Santiago 10.3389/fmed.2024.1400585
investigators, CRCs, nurses, pharmacists, and monitors, have
pivotal roles in the successful execution of CT. Clearly deﬁning
roles, providing adaptive and continuous professional training, and
fostering a culture of collaboration and communication are pivotal
in ensuring success in this ﬁeld. Addressing recruitment, retention,
and professional growth challenges is also essential.
Although professional proﬁles and roles of the experts involved
in CTs are not well delineated, some roles and functions are
recognized internationally as essential for its deployment, especially
in highly complex CTs. In this sense, a relevant advance has
taken place in recent years. As CTs gain weight as a relevant
part of the activity of worldwide leader healthcare systems,
better delineation of roles, training, and a higher degree of
professionalization are desirable.
Across all roles, there is a clear need for more standardized,
formalized, and accessible training programs to ensure that
professionals are equipped to meet the demands of their roles
in clinical trials. Also, a collaborative approach and enhanced
training programs tailored to each professional role’s speciﬁc
needs and challenges within the CT framework are convenient.
All professionals involved in clinical trials must navigate a
complex landscape of ethical and regulatory requirements and
new technology advances, underscoring the need for continuous
education and adherence to ethical standards.
Speciﬁc strategies are needed to front the challenges related to
the professionals involved in CT in the healthcare arena. Principal
investigators should focus on enhancing protocol compliance
through rigorous training in GCP and regulatory updates, ensuring
they are well-versed in the latest standards and delegated in
adequately trained teams. For clinical research coordinators,
implementing project management tools and comprehensive
training in patient interaction and data management systems is
advised to eﬀectively manage the trial’s increased complexity.
Monitors could beneﬁt from advanced training in risk-based
monitoring techniques and digital monitoring tools to enhance the
eﬃciency and eﬀectiveness of site visits and remote monitoring
tasks. Nurses, who often face direct patient care challenges, should
receive ongoing support in patient management systems and be
given access to continuous education in trial-speciﬁc procedures
and treatments. These steps will enhance individual performance
and improve clinical trials’ overall functioning, ensuring data
integrity, participant safety, and regulatory compliance.
Digitalization can streamline many aspects of CT processes,
from patient recruitment and data collection to protocol
compliance and real-time monitoring. This improves eﬃciency,
enhances data integrity, and reduces the administrative burden
on staﬀ. For instance, electronic health records and mobile healthapplications could be more extensively utilized to facilitate seamless
communication and accurate data tracking.
Future studies could explore the speciﬁc impacts of digital
technologies on trial eﬃciency and participant safety, the
eﬀectiveness of new training modalities, and the long-term beneﬁts
of these innovations on clinical trial outcomes. Research into the
development of a standardized framework for integrating digital
tools across various stages of clinical trials could also provide
valuable insights and guidance for the ﬁeld.
