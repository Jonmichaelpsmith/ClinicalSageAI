PROTOCOL TITLE :Open-Label, Multicenter, Controlled Study of Exemestane 
(Aromasin®) with or withoutCelecoxib (Celebrex®) in Postmenopausal Women with 
Advanced Breast Cancer (ABC)Having Progressed on Tamoxifen
Study Centers:  Subjects were recruited at 20 centers in 9 countries: 4 in India, 1 in the 
Philippines, 5 in Belgium, 2 in Peru, 2 in Mexico, 2 in Colombia, 2 in Brazil, 1 in Canada 
and 1 co-ordinating site in the US.
Study Initiation and Completion Dates: 23 January 2002  to 27 March 2008
Phase of Development:  Phase 2
Study Objectives:  
Primary
To evaluate the effect of celecoxib on clini cal benefit (defined as the frequency of 
objective tumor response and disease stabilization for at least 24 weeks) of exemestane in 
postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer (ABC) having progressed on 
tamoxifen.
Secondary
To evaluate the effect of c elecoxib on other efficacy parameters than clinical benefit and 
on the tolerability (incidence and severity of systemic toxicity) of exemestane in 
postmenopausal women with ABC having progressed on tamoxifen, and its effect on the 
exemestane pharmacodynami cs and pharmacokinetics (PKs).
METHODS
Study Design:  This was an open-label, multicenter, randomized (1:1 randomization ratio)
study of exemestane and exemestane combined with celecoxib in postmenopausal women 
with ABC having progressed on tamoxifen.  The  study design included administration of

Page 2exemestane alone in order to confirm the reproducibility of results from previous studies and 
to exclude any bias that could have resulted from possible changes in the subject population.  
Number of Subjects (Planned and Analyzed):  It was planned to include 100 subjects in 
the study;111 subjects were enrolled, of which 55subjects were assigned to the exemestane 
arm and 56 to the combination arm (exemestane + celecoxib).
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion:  This study included postmenopausal female 
subjects with ABC with disease progression who had progressed on tamoxifen.  Selected 
inclusion criteria included: estrogen receptor positive (ER+ve) and/or progesterone receptor 
positive (PgR+ve) or unknown receptors (if previous response to tamoxifen); and at least 
1measurable tumoral lesion.
Study Treatment:  Subjects randomized to exemestane alone received an oral dose taken 
with food (25 mg tablet once daily); subjects randomized to the combination treatment 
received oral doses to be taken with food (25 mg tablet exemestane once daily; 
celecoxib2x200 mg tablets twice daily) throughout the study period.  Subjects remained in 
the study until disease progression, death or unacceptable toxicity.  
Efficacy Evaluations:  The primary endpoint of the study was to determine antitumor 
efficacy and was based on objective tumor assessmentsmade according to the Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) system of unidimensional evaluation.  The 
timing and type of tumor evaluations were carried out at baseline and on Week 8,16, and 24, 
every 12 weeks beyond Week 24 up to Week 108, and every 24 weeks afterwards.
Secondary endpoints  were as follows :
1.Duration of objective response (in subjects with complete response [CR] or partial 
response [PR]):the time from thefirst objective documentation of response until the first 
objective documentation of tumor progression or death due to tumor progression in the 
absence of previous documentation of tumor progression.
2.Duration of long-term stable disease (SD) (in subjects with long-term SD):the time from 
randomization until the first objective documentation of tumor progression or death due 
to tumor progression in the absence of previous documentation of tumor progr ession.   
3.Duration of clinical benefit (in subjects with CR, PR or long-term SD):the time  from 
randomization until the first objective documentation of tumor progression or death due 
to tumor progression in the absence of previous documentation of tumor p rogression.   
4.Time to tumor progression (TTP):the time from randomization to first objective 
documentation of tumor recurrence or progression or death due to tumor progression in 
the absence of previous documentation of tumor progression.
For subjectswho did not have objective evidence of tumor progression and who were 
removed from the study, or who died of causes not related to cancer, or those subjects who 
were given antitumor treatment otherthan the study treatment, duration of objective 
response, duration of long-term SD, duration of clinical benefit and TTP were to be censored.

Page 3Subjects who died of unknown causeswere considered to have died due to tumor 
progression.
5.Time to treatment failure (TTF):the time from the randomization to the date of f irst 
objective documentation of tumor recurrence or progression or death due to any cause or 
withdrawal from study treatment due to any reason, whichever was the earliest event. 
Subject s who were still on treatment at the time of the analysis were not to beconsidered 
to have experienced treatment failure. For those subjects, TTF was censored at last 
available assessment.   
6.Survival:the time from randomization to the date of death due to any cause. Subjects 
alive at the timeof analysis and subjects lost to follow-up were censoredat last available 
assessment.
Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Evaluations:  
Pharmacokinetics
Plasma concentrations of exemestane and its metabolite 17-hydroexemestane were 
determined in subjects in selected centers to explore the effect of celecoxib on the exposure 
to exemestane.
Pharmacodynamics
Evaluations included plasma concentrations of estradiol (E2), estrone (E1), estrone sulfate 
(E1S) and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG).
Safety Evaluations:  Safety evaluations included the monitoring of all adverse events (AEs); 
hematological, biochemical and urinary parameters; vital signs and electrocardiogram 
(ECG).
Physicalexamination including the determination of body weight, diastolic and systolic
blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were performed at baseline, before dosing, and at
each subsequent visit. Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 
wasassessed at each visit. An ECG was performed at baseline, before dosing, and after 
dosing ifclinically indicated.  Laboratory tests (hematology: hemoglobin, white blood cell 
[WBC] countwith differentials, platelet count; blood chemistry: total serum bilirubin, 
alkalinephosphatase, alanine transaminase [ALT], aspartate transaminase [AST], gamma 
glutamyl transferase [GGT], totalprotein, total calcium, glucose, creatinine, blood urea 
nitrogen, total cholesterol, high-densitylipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides; and 
urinalysis: pH and protein) were performed ateach scheduled visit.
Statistical Methods:  Subjects were randomized according to a minimization procedure to 
balance major prognostic factors(response to prior tamoxifen, prior chemotherapy and site of 
metastases) in the 2 treatment arms.  The sample size for the combination arm was 
determined according to the 1 stage Fleming design.  The inclusion of the exemestane arm in 
the study was used as internal control.  Overall, 50subjects perarm wereneeded to account 
for an approximately 10% non-evaluability rate.

Page 4Efficacy Analyses
The primary endpoint of this study was the evaluation of the clinical benefit rate defined as
the proportion of subjects who achieved objective tumor response (CR or PR)or long-term 
disease stabilization (SD lasting at least 24 weeks) out of the totalnumber of subjects 
included in the population (evaluable or intent-to-treat [ITT]). The 95% confidence interval 
(CI) forthe clinical benefit rate was calculated using the normal approximation of the 
binomialdistribution. The estimation of the objective response rate was also provided.
Secondary efficacy endpoints (duration of clinicalbenefit, duration of objective response, 
duration of long-term SD, TTP, TTF and survival) were estimated by Kaplan and Meier
methods and graphically presented both in the evaluableand the ITT populations.  Analyses 
focused on the combination arm, but were also provided forthe exemestane arm.
Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Analyses
Descriptive statistics were provided for all PK and pharmacodynamic parameters.
Safety Analyses
AEs were coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities(MedDRA 
Version11.1) and weredescribed in terms of severity, seriousness and study treatment 
relationship.  Aggregations according to the SystemOrgan Class were provided. Data were 
analyzed by subject. The worstseverity grade was the one reported during the entire study 
period.  
Laboratory data was graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria (NCI CTC; Version 2.0) classificationwhenever possible. For each 
parameter, a cross-tabulation of the worst grade observedduring treatment versus the 
baseline was provided.  
RESULTS
Subject Disposition and Demography:  Subject disposition and subjects analyzed are 
summarized in TableS1.  A total of 111 subjects were randomized (55 subjects in the 
exemestane arm; 56 subjects in the combination arm); 2subjects in the exemestane arm were 
not treated.  Eleven subjects were considered non-evaluable for efficacy, either because they 
were never treated, has less than 4weeks of treatment or had an early withdrawal. There 
were 5 subjects whowere non-evaluable for safety: 2 subjects (3.6%) were randomized but 
never treated in theexemestane arm and 3subjects (5.4%) were treated but never assessed 
for safety in the combinationarm.  
Approximately 54% of subjects completed at least Weeks16-24 of treatment (49.1% in the 
exemestane arm and 58.9% in the combination arm), and approximately 3% of subjects 
completed more than 180weeks of treatment.  The median duration of treatment was 
16.3weeks (range 3.3-296.0 weeks) and 18.4weeks (range 0.3-302.3weeks) for the 
exemestane and combination arms, respectively.

The demographic characteristics age, race and body mass index were similar in both arms.  
The distribution of ECOG performance status (0, 1 or 2) was similar for both arms.  Other 
baseline characteristics (postmenopausal status, tumor history, prior antitumor treatment, 
receptor status and site of disease) were also similar for the 2treatment arms.
Efficacy Results: 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint
Clinical benefit and objective response rates were similar for the 2treatment arms 
(TableS2).  Clinical benefit was observed in 24 subjects in each arm, showing a clinical 
benefit rate of 49.0% in the combination arm and 47.1% in the exemestane arm.  Objective 
response was observed in 12 subjects in the combination arm and 11 subjects in the 
exemestane arm; the resulting objective response rates were 23.5% in the combination arm 
and 22.4% in the exemestane arm.
Similar results were seen for the ITT population.  Tumor response was similar for the 2arms 
when stratified for previous response to tamoxifen, previous chemotherapy and site of 
metastasis and according to receptor status.

Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
For the evaluable for efficacy population, the subjects with clinical benefit (24 subjects per 
treatment arm), had a median duration of response of 96.6 weeks in the combination arm and 
49.1 weeks in the exemestane arm (TableS3).  Confidence intervals (95%) were wide for 
both arms, with the lower CI similar for both arms (37weeks).
Approximately 20% of subjects had an objective response in each arm, with the median 
duration for the combination arm (40.1weeks) approximately 7weeks longer than for the 
exemestane arm (32.7weeks).  Again, CIs were wide and the lower CI was similar for both 
arms.
Median duration of SD ≥24weeks was 109.7weeks in the combination arm (12subjects) and 
52.9weeks in the exemestane arm (13 subjects); the 95% CI were wide and the lower CI was 
similar for both treatments.
For both treatments, median TTP and median TTF were similar; approximately 20weeks.
The number of deaths was similar for both arms: 32 and 37deaths for the exemestane and 
combination arms, respectively.  Median survival time was approximately 75weeks for both 
treatments.

Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Results:
Pharmacokinetic Results
Pharmacokinetic samples were available from 13subjects in the combination arm and from 
5subjects in exemestane arm.  After exemestane alone, exemestane concentrations were in 
reasonable agreement with those obtained in a previous study in subjects with ABC.  In both 
arms, some variability could be observed in the concentrations of both drug and metabolite.  
After exemestane alone, drug levels were slightly higher than those after the combination 
arm; 95% CIs suggested no difference in PK parameters between the 2 treatment arms.  The 
metabolite-to-parent ratio after the combination therapy was not altered in comparison to that 
obtained after exemestane alone.
Pharmacodynamic Results
After exemestane alone, the mean values for inhibition of E2, E1 and E1S ranged between 
81% and 89%.  Although the 95% CIs of average inhibition for E2 (both Day 29 and 57 
values) and E1S (Day 29 only) indicated a difference between exemestane and combination 
arms, absolute concentrations were similar between the 2treatment arms for all the 
3hormones.  The difference in outcome of the 2parameters, absolute concentration and 
percentage inhibition, was probably due to the combination arm baseline concentrations for 
all estrogens being lower than those measured in the exemestane arm.
After exemestane alone, the mean values for inhibition of SHBG were 29.3% and 41.2% at 
Day 29 and Day 57, respectively.  The 95% CIs for SHBG either expressed in terms of 
absolute values or in term of percentage inhibition indicated that there were no relevant 
differences between the 2treatment arms.
Safety Results:  Most subjects reported at least 1treatment emergent AE (TableS4).  Fewer
than 30% of subjects reported treatment-related AEs; these were reported by 13 and 
15subjects in the exemestane and combination arms, respectively.  Most AEs were Grade 1 
or 2 in severity, although for approximately 20% and 8% of subjects (across both treatment

The most common system organ class (SOC) of AE was Musculoskeletal and connective 
tissue disorders, which were reported by 42% and 49% of subjects in the exemestane and 
combination arms, respectively (TableS5), most commonly back pain.  Most of these AEs 
were not treatment-related.  Other common AEs pertained to the Gastrointestinal disorders 
and General disorders and administration site conditions SOCs.  Incidence of events in each 
of these SOCs was similar for the exemestane and combination arms.  There was a higher 
incidence of events in the Metabolism and nutrition disorders and in Investigations in the 
exemestane arm than the combination arm, while the incidence of events in Infections and 
infestations was higher with the combination treatment.
Cardiac disorders were rare: 1 subject (1.9%) in the combination arm experienced cardiac 
failure congestive (Grade3); this was considered to be related to study medication.  Bleeding 
events were also rare: ulcer hemorrhage (1subject [1.9%]) and vaginal hemorrhage 
(2subjects [3.8%]) were reported for the exemestane arm; the ulcer hemorrhage was 
considered to be related to study medication.

A total of 23 subjects had serious adverse events (SAEs) or death reported (14 in the 
combination arm and 9 in the exemestane arm).  The majority of SAEs were related to the 
subjects’ underlying disease; however, there were 3SAEs that were reported as related to 
study drug: 1subject in the exemestane arm had deep vein thrombosis (DVT) which resolved 
after 14 days, 1 subject in the combination arm had a hypersensitivity reaction which 
resolved after 13 days, and subject in the combination arm had congestive cardiac failure, 
which was ongoing when study treatment was withdrawn.
Five subjects died as a result of SAEs:
A 57 -year old subject died d ue to a cardiorespiratory arrest.
A 44 -year old subject died due to pulmonary embolism secondary to DVT  due to paresis.
A 46 -year old subject died due to acute respiratory failure.
An 83-year old subject died because of a general deterioration in health d ue to the disease
under study.
A 68-year old subject died d ue to respiratory failure.
Most clinical laboratory abnormalities were Grade 1 or 2.  Grade3 and 4 abnormalities are 
detailed in TableS6.  Some of the Grade3 abnormalities had been present at baseline.  Two 
Grade 4 abnormalities were observed: total bilirubin for 1subject in the exemestane arm (no 
grade at baseline) and GGT for 1subject in the combination arm (was Grade3 at baseline).

CONCLUSIONS:
The demographic characteristics were similar in both arms and the 2groups appeared 
balanced with respect to the prognostic factors.  The majority of subjects in both groups were 
affected by visceral metastases, a factor known to be associated with a worse prognosis and a 
poor outcome.
The duration of clinical benefit was almost twice as long with the combination arm compared 
to the exemestane arm. The median duration of prolonged stabilization of disease (SD 
24weeks ) was also almost twice as long in the combination arm. It should be noted that the 
sample size was relatively small, making the 95% CIs for each of these parameters wide and 
in some case overlapping for the 2treatment arms.  Median survival time was similar for the 
2treatment arms.
The results of this study indicated that the combination of exemestane plus celecoxib wasan 
effective and tolerated treatment for hormone-dependent ABC.  The exploratory nature of
this study and the limited sample size did not allow firm conclusions to be drawn regarding 
the anti-tumor activity of the combination arm; however, the increases in the duration of 
clinical benefit and objective response suggested the possibility that the addition of celecoxib 
to exemestane could sustain the stabilization of the disease or the response obtained with the 
exemestane treatment alone by delaying disease progression.
