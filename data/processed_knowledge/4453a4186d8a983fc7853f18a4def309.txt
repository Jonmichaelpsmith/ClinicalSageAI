Objective: To explore the structure and content of a
non-random sample of clinical study reports (CSRs) to
guide clinicians and systematic reviewers.
Search strategy: We searched public sources and
lodged Freedom of Information requests for previouslyconfidential CSRs primarily written by the industry forregulators.
Selection criteria: CSRs reporting sufficient
information for extraction ( ‘adequate ’).
Primary outcome measures: Presence and length
of essential elements of trial design and reporting andcompression factor (ratio of page length for CSRscompared to its published counterpart in a scientificjournal).
Data extraction: Data were extracted on standard
forms and crosschecked for accuracy.
Results: We assembled a population of 78 CSRs
(covering 90 randomised controlled trials; 144 610pages total) dated 1991 –2011 of 14 pharmaceuticals.
Report synopses had a median length of 5 pages,efficacy evaluation 13.5 pages, safety evaluation17 pages, attached tables 337 pages, trial protocol62 pages, statistical analysis plan 15 pages andindividual efficacy and safety listings had a medianlength of 447 and 109.5 pages, respectively. While16 (21%) of CSRs contained completed case reportforms, these were accessible to us in only one case(765 pages representing 16 individuals). Compressionfactors ranged between 1 and 8805.
Conclusions: Clinical study reports represent a
hitherto mostly hidden and untapped source of detailed
and exhaustive data on each trial. They should beconsulted by independent parties interested in adetailed record of a clinical trial, and should form thebasic unit for evidence synthesis as their use is likelyto minimise the problem of reporting bias. We cannotsay whether our sample is representative and whetherour conclusions are generalisable to an undefined andundefinable population of CSRs.
INTRODUCTION
Systematic reviews are thought to provide
one of the most robust ways to evaluatethe effects of healthcare interventions. But
the robustness of ﬁndings clearly rests upon
reviewers having suf ﬁcient access to clinicaltrial information to critically evaluate and
reproduce the original research. Research onreporting bias over the last decades has
shown that trusting the published literature
at face value, even peer-reviewed publica-tions, can be fraught with dif ﬁculty —a
problem that spans drug classes.
1–12
Following the decision by the European
regulator, the European Medicines Agency
(EMA) on 30 November 2010, to make avail-
able a broad spectrum of documents related tomedicinal products for human and veterinary
use,
13 14attention has focused on one particu-
lar type of regulatory document —clinical study
reports (CSRs).15–18CSRs are usually writtenARTICLE SUMMARY
Article focus
▪What are clinical study reports (CSRs)? What do
they contain and how long are they?
▪Can CSRs help address reporting biases asso-ciated with the published literature, and improvethe quality of evidence synthesis?
Key messages
▪CSRs represent a hitherto hidden and untappedsource of detailed randomised controlled trialdata (mean page length: 1854 pages), increas-ingly becoming publicly available, and shouldform the basic unit for evidence synthesis tominimise the problem of reporting bias.
▪CSRs show that numerous individuals makeimportant technical contributions to the design,conduct and reporting of each trial, but journalpublications often fail to record these details,resulting in a loss in individual responsibility forwhat is reported.
▪The ICH E3 guideline to which most CSRsconform was published in 1995, and needsupdating.
Strengths and limitations of this study
▪We cannot say whether our sample is represen-tative and whether our conclusions are generalis-able to an undefined and undefinable populationof CSRs.

for regulators following guidelines developed by the
industry regulatory collaborative effort ‘International
Conference on Harmonisation of T echnical Requirementsfor Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use ’
(ICH). The ICH guidelines ‘structure and content of
clinical study reports ’
19(see online supplementary appen-
dix 1) are known by the document code ‘E3’.T h e yw e r e
formalised in 1995 ‘to assist sponsors in the development
of a report that is complete, free from ambiguity, well orga-nised and easy [for regulators] to review ’.
19E3 has not
been edited or changed since 1995.
CSRs are but one category of information that is trans-
mitted from study sponsors to regulators ( ﬁgure 1), but
are important as they contain substantially more informa-
tion and detail on the intervention being tested than pub-
lished versions of the same trial. The wealth of informationmay be sought with increasing frequency by researchers
appraising single trials, entire trial programmes, or by
those synthesising evidence.
17 20We are aware of two
recent examples of systematic reviews of the effects of phar-
maceuticals carried out using CSRs and other regulatory
material.12 21One group also concluded that journal publi-
cations insuf ﬁciently report clinical trials.22
Despite CSRs ’potential importance little is known
about their structure and content outside of those indivi-duals with direct involvement in regulatory processes.
This knowledge gap may hinder development of
methods for fair and reliable appraisal of CSRs andtheir use in evidence synthesis. We are not aware of anyinstruments speciﬁ cally designed for appraising CSRs.
Lack of visibility may also hinder understanding ofthe complexity of the organisation and the reporting ofclinical trials.
We carried out an exploratory review to describe the
structure and content of a non-random sample of CSRs.By describing the contents of CSRs, this research seeks
to transform CSRs from an obscure document only
known to regulators and industry into a more widelyknown and accessible document. Our long-term inten-
tion is to improve the credibility of research synthesis by
facilitating a move from the level of detail found injournal articles to the level of detail found in regulatory
documents, thus guiding clinicians and other decision
makers at all levels.
METHODS
We obtained CSRs from public sources, as follows:1. Requesting from EMA, under its Freedom of
Information (FOI) policy, CSRs for manufacturer-sponsored trials of the 10 best-selling prescription-bound products in the USA in 2010.
23
2. Reusing CSRs from our own previous research (osel-
tamivir and zanamivir).12
3. Downloading CSRs openly available on the Internet.

CSRs through an FOI request to Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) (epoetin alfa).
5. Requesting manufacturers ﬁll any gaps in the com-
pleteness of reports that we believe are legallyrequired to be publicly available (paroxetine).
To create as broad a database as possible, we did not
apply restrictions in drug type or family or sponsor. We didnot submit requests under the Freedom of InformationAct to the FDA, because such requests can take years to be
fulﬁlled and —if fulﬁ lled—may be heavily redacted.
24
We did not draw a random sample of CSRs as there is
no known sampling frame. No one knows how manyreports have been written by intervention category as
there is no central register of CSRs. Through familiaritywith CSRs for oseltamivir and zanamivir, which were
included in one of our Cochrane reviews,
12we devel-
oped and piloted a data extraction sheet designed to
capture the salient characteristics of CSRs. We created a
list of around 40 potential sections we expected to ﬁnd,
generated directly from elements speci ﬁed in E3. For
each element in the list, we checked whether theobtained CSRs included that section (conﬁ rmed either
by direct identi ﬁcation of the section or an indication
the section existed based on the CSRs ’table of con-
tents), whether we had access to it and its page length.
Because of previous dif ﬁculties we had accessing CSRs
appendices, we also recorded whether sections were
listed as appendices or not. The page length was calcu-
lated either by directly counting the pages or by estimat-ing their size from the table of contents of each report,
and was used as a crude proxy for the level of detail
available. The page lengths were rounded up to the nextinteger, and were summarised by reporting medians and
ranges. We also included questions relating to trial regis-
tration and authorship. Our (blank) data extractionsheet is in online supplementary appendix 2.
All variables from CSRs were ﬁrst extracted in single.
We subsequently audited each other’ s extractions, check-
ing the accurateness of the information. We chose to
present elements analogous with those that typically
appear in trials reported in scienti ﬁc journals including
the study synopsis (a brief summary of the study), the
study protocol (written prospectively, describing the study
methods), ef ﬁcacy and safety evaluations (a narrative
summary of the ef ﬁcacy and safety results of the study,
including tables and ﬁgures), as well as attached tables.
We also included elements rarely found in journal publi-cations: sample (blank) and completed case report forms
(CRFs are paper or electronic forms designed to capture
prespeci ﬁed ef ﬁcacy and safety related informationfor each study participant), the statistical analysis plan (aprospectively written narrative and/or statistical code
indicating how trial data will be analysed) and individual
participant ef ﬁcacy and safety listings. The corresponding
E3 section numbers are listed in table 2. Disagreements
were resolved by discussion.
Our uncorrected (original) and corrected extraction
sheets as well as audit records are available upon request
from the corresponding author.
We calculated a compression factor for published
trials which we de ﬁned as the ratio of CSR page length
compared to the page length of the same trial as pub-
lished in scienti ﬁc journals. The objective of this metric
was to convey a rough sense of how much information
present in CSRs may be condensed ( ‘compressed ’)i n
short journal publications, in consideration of CSRs ’far
greater length and level of detail. The size (pagelength) re ﬂects the level of detail as well as the presence
of many elements such as protocols and their amend-
ments, randomisation lists, statistical analysis plans, certi-
ﬁcates of analysis and extra data on subpopulations. We
have demonstrated
12that these elements are essential
for understanding and appraising a trial. The compres-sion factor is a crude measure of how much is com-
pressed or simply left out of each publication which willaffect the reliability of the appraisal and interpretation
of trials. Trial publications were searched for in multiple
sources —clinical trial registers, published systematic
reviews and correspondence with sponsors. Because in
most cases we could not access all parts of all CSRs (and
therefore do not know their complete page length), wecalculated ‘conservative ’compression factors as well as
‘realistic ’compression factors. ‘Conservative ’compres-
sion factors were calculated on a trial by trial basis usingthe total number of pages in CSRs available to us
divided by the length of journal reports for that same
trial, whereas ‘realistic ’compression factors were based
on the true total page length of the CSRs.
RESULTS
We identi ﬁed 84 documents believed to be CSRs for 14
compounds. These covered therapeutic and biological
interventions including antipsychotics, antidepressants,
antivirals, natural antiarthritics, anti-in ﬂammatory
agents, pandemic in ﬂuenza vaccines, statins, erythro-
poietins and antiplatelet compounds. We includedEnglish-language summaries of two Japanese oseltamivir
studies ( JV15823 and JV15824) as they had been pre-sented to EMA in this form. We excluded documents
which were sections of CSRs that nonetheless contained
insufﬁ cient information to understand the overall
content of the CSRs (olanzapine F1D-LC-HGA V ,
F1D-MC-HGAJ and F1D-MC-HGAO) and three docu-
ments which we had originally classi ﬁed as CSRs but
were not (reboxetine 14, 22 and 37). This left us with 78
CSRs (144 610 pages) ( ﬁgure 2). The median pages
obtained per CSR was 644 (range 9 –15 440). Only 4 of

78 CSRs (reboxetine 8, 16, 17 and 91) were written
prior to 30 November 1995 when ICH E3 was approved.
Table 1 summarises the pharmaceutical, manufacturer,
date and provenance of the CSRs in our review. EMA
reported not holding studies for esomeprazole magne-
sium (Nexium), Advair Diskus, quetiapine fumarate
(Seroquel), montelukast sodium (Singulair), epoetinalfa (Epogen) and simvastatin.
All of the 78 included CSRs contained a synopsis
(median page length 5 pages). The ef ﬁcacy evaluation
was identi ﬁable and directly accessible in 76 (97%;
median length 13.5 pages) and safety in 77 (99%;median length 17 pages). The attached tables were like-wise present in 63 (81%) CSRs, with a median of 337
pages long (range 1– 3665). Seventy-three CSRs (94%)
reported including the study protocol. In the 40 proto-
cols we could access, the median page length was 62. We
found blank CRFs included in 68 (87%) CSRs. Of the 33
blank CRFs we could directly access, the median lengthwas 133 pages (range 14– 981). For completed CRFs, 16
(21%) reports made direct mention of a section on com-pleted CRFs, but we had access to completed CRFs inonly 1 case (Arthronat; length 765 pages).
Fifty-ﬁve (71%) of 78 included CSRs included a statis-
tical analysis plan in some form. Of those for which wecould directly access the content (n=37), the median page
length was 15 (range 3 –85). Individual ef ﬁcacy and safety
listings were included in 53 (69%) and 62 (81%) CSRs,
respectively. The median page length was 447 (range 15 –
21 698) for ef ﬁcacy and 109.5 (range 2 –10 954) for safety.A summary is presented in table 2.
All trial reports in our review were sponsored by the
pharmaceutical industry.
Median conservative compression factors ranged
between 1 and 1221. The realistic compression factors
calculated for the Arthronat, paroxetine and
Clopidogrel versus Aspirin In Patients at Risk ofIschaemic Events (CAPRIE) trials were 379, 1021 and
8805, respectively ( table 3).
DISCUSSION
We collected and described a sizeable number of CSRs
written in the last two decades. All CSRs contained a table
of contents (as speci ﬁed in E3 section 3); this, together
with optical character recognition (to enable searching the
full text of the scanned documents) and the occasional
need to combine multiple ﬁles to create a single docu-
ment, substantially improved the ease of navigating CSRs.
Despite the size of our non-random sample, it is
unclear whether our conclusions are generalisable to allother CSRs. This is because we have extremely limited
knowledge about the total population of CSRs in regula-
tors’and sponsors ’possession. Nevertheless, within our
sample spanning different manufacturers, therapeutic
classes and times, we found that the structure of CSRs
was, within different house styles of presentation, strik-ingly similar, probably owing to the guidance by ICH
E3.
25This suggests that the structure and content of
other CSRs is likely to be similar.Figure 2 Study flow.

The future basic currency of research synthesis?
The median length of 644 pages for reports in this
study, as well as CSRs ’routine inclusion of trials’ proto-
col, statistical analysis plans and blank case report forms,
strongly suggests that CSRs are the most detailed and
complete, integrated form of reporting of the design,conduct and results of clinical trials. In a study that dir-
ectly compared the adequacy of reporting between
journal articles and CSRs, the authors found that com-plete information regarding greater than 40% of
methods items were only available in CSRs.
22The level
of detail found in CSRs thus far surpass the level of
detail available in journal publications, and as such they
are prime candidates for the next basic currency of evi-
dence synthesis and appraisal of a trial. Given the EMA ’s
new policy of making such documents publicly available,
access to these documents is now relatively straightfor-
ward.26However, including CSRs in systematic reviews is
labor-intensive, given their size and complexity.12
Accessing complete CSRsAlthough CSRs may trump other forms of trial reportingin the public domain (such as conference abstracts or
journal publications), serious limitations remain. Despite
obtaining 144 610 pages for 78 CSRs, in almost allinstances, we lacked complete access to the CSRs ’
numerous appendices. Even for the sole complete CSRwe obtained (Arthronat MA-CT-10 –002), case report
forms were provided for only 20% of participants. The
Arthronat text does not provide a reason for this omis-
sion, but it re ﬂects the vagueness of the relevant section
of the E3 guidance (16.3.2) which does not de ﬁne
‘other CRFs submitted ’. Also, we could only access the
original trial protocol in 40 (51%) of 78 CSRs obtained.This is important because trial protocols, written prior
to patient enrollment in a trial, are an important way to
guard against reporting biases.
27 28
We could obtain individual patient listings in only a
minority of cases despite con ﬁrming their inclusion in the
majority of CSRs ( table 2 ). This may be a signi ﬁcantlimitation, as the E3 speci ﬁes that ‘the report with its
appendices should also provide enough individual patientdata, including the demographic and baseline data, anddetails of analytical methods, to allow replication of the crit-
ical analyses. ’
19Unavailability was possibly owing to the fact
that EMA allows manufacturers to submit CSRs omitting a
number of appendices including individual patient data
and case report forms (which EMA states should be avail-
able within 48 h, if requested).29In the case of oseltamivir,
the primary drug analysed in a Cochrane review we con-
ducted,12the manufacturer refused to share with us report
appendices not submitted to EMA,30and EMA declined
requesting them on our behalf.8Although FDA likely pos-
sesses more complete CSRs and patient-level data, it histor-
ically has treated such data as trade secret and/orconﬁdential.

reliable source of obtaining CSRs. As such, despite
European regulators ’progressive stance —announcing that
‘clinical trial data should not be considered commercial
conﬁ dential information ’34—the completeness gap is
unlikely to be ﬁlled any time soon.
Another signi ﬁcant limitation is that CSRs are only
written for therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnosticagents, and therefore inadequacies remain in evidence
synthesis of other types of interventions such as surgical
or behavioural interventions.
Individual participant listings
Individual participant listings —which identify partici-
pants by a unique ID —were accessible in 29 of the 78
CSRs we reviewed. But these data are dif ﬁcult to analyse
because they are presented as database printouts ratherthan in the original computer data ﬁles. This is under-
standable considering that CSRs are a written/archivalformat, but because EMA does not accept SAS formatdataﬁles,
35 36the industry standard, third-party access to
databases of patient-level data remains elusive. We seeno compelling reason why all regulators should notrequest these from sponsors and make them publicly
available. Whether availability of individual listings
and CRFs, with its attendant laborious analysis, wouldincrease our understanding of the trial and its results is
unclear. But there is at least one case where the reanaly-
sis of CRFs added invaluable knowledge to that alreadyavailable in CSRs.
37
The public –private debate
One manufacturer has claimed that the non-release of
case report forms is motivated by concerns over protect-
ing participants ’conﬁdentiality.38Nothing we have seen
so far corroborates this claim, however an ongoing EMA
working group is speci ﬁcally discussing issues related to
protecting participants ’conﬁdentiality. Based on current
document releases and position statements, however, itappears that EMA has deemed case report forms and
individual patient listings to be, in principle, releasablein their entirety (after a preliminary review).
39
Furthermore, individual patient listings are intended toduplicate information contained in ﬁlled case report
forms. The release of case report forms would ensure
the accuracy of individual patient listings with little add-
itional risk to patient con ﬁdentiality. Moreover, extra
checks such as registration of protocols by bona ﬁde
research groups could deter any inappropriate use. Wealso believe that the sheer bulk of the forms act as adeterrent against malice.
Size matters
Our range of compression factors shows the scale of
selection and synthesis which must (consciously or
unconsciously) occur in the process of transformingCSRs into journal-length articles. We found a strong
resemblance in detail, page length, structure and
purpose between the short synopsis section of CSRs andreports of trials as published in scienti ﬁc journals. In
some cases essential items of information such as the
trial protocol and its subsequent amendments are simply
not included in journal articles or are replaced bymethods written post facto. In other cases of items essen-
tial for the interpretations of the trial results (such as
the statistical analysis plan), tens of pages are reduced toa paragraph on sample size calculation in the journal
report, underscoring the lack of detail (and its attendant
problems) common to public forms of trial reporting.For example, the ratio of words in the protocol of the
CSR for aripiprazole CN138135 to the methods section
for published journal article of the same trial is 30.5(53 713 words in the CSR protocol vs 1763 words in the
journal article). For the oseltamivir WP16263 trial, the
ratio was 22.7 (26 761 words in the CSR protocol andamendments vs 1177 words in the journal article).
This compression of information also occurs in databases
not restricted by length, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
40
Our study raises the question of why the medical com-
munity has accepted the low (summary, aggregate) levelof detail found in most peer-reviewed journal publica-tions compared with the depth of detail available in
CSRs. European regulators recently noted: ‘documents
that provide critical information on a study, such as the
protocol (16.1.1), statistical methods (16.1.9), list of
investigators and study sites and sample case report
forms, would always be needed by reviewers assessing astudy. ’
41Why have those outside of the regulatory world
tolerated journal publications lacking such details?
One possibility may be that while the clinical trial
enterprise has changed dramatically in the last half
century, the scienti ﬁc journal publication model has not.
Since the 1950s, there have been considerable transfor-
mations in the political economy of clinical trials driven
by the increasingly commercialised and global nature of
the pharmaceutical industry, the rise in academic-industry ‘partnerships ’in medicine and increased com-
munication among regulators. It is now common to ﬁnd
trials with study centres scattered around the globe. Thisincreasing complexity and the need to provide an audit
record is re ﬂected in the comprehensive tomes docu-
menting the trials —CSRs —but trial reporting in scien-
tiﬁc journals remains limited to summary and aggregate
details. It should be noted, however, that many journals
now have websites which enable them to make availableextended content beyond what traditionally appears in
the printed journal.
Authorship or contributorship?
Examination of CSRs revealed scores of important tech-
nical contributions to the design, conduct and reportingof each trial. These included contributions from data-
base programmers, records of ﬁcers and CSR writers,
often invisible in the published journal article. In some
cases, we found no mention in CSRs of individuals
who ﬁgured as authors of subsequent published trial
reports while individuals named as CSR authors went

unacknowledged in journal publications. Current
International Committee of Medical Journal Editors
(ICMJE) guidelines on authorship and contributorship
are largely focused on ensuring those placed on by-linesdeserve to be authors. But the guidelines also suggest
that ‘all contributors who do not meet the criteria for
authorship should be listed in an acknowledgements
section ’.
42Given the complexity of clinical trials, the
ICMJE should call for itemised contributorship: thenames of all contributors to be speciﬁ ed along with
their role in the design, conduct, analysis or reporting
of the trial. If the contribution to the trial of most
people goes unrecorded, so does their individualresponsibility for what is produced. Itemised contribu-
torship records, to all phases of a trial, could be piloted
in trial registers.
E3 guidance
The E3 guideline set an excellent standard, but it needsformal updating and further development. For example,
there should be a self-standing set of de ﬁnitions for
terms such as ‘CRFs ’and‘other CRFs submitted ’(section
16.3.2) and a description of how a particular trial ﬁts
within a sponsor ’s trial programme of pharmaceutical
development. Apparently forgotten items such as certi ﬁ-
cates of analysis (describing the appearance and contentof the interventions being tested) and post-1995 details
such as trial registration numbers should be mentioned.
We hope our review has given CSRs what they have
lacked so far: visibility. CSRs represent a largelyuntapped source of detailed data that we believe canserve as a means of addressing the ravages of reporting
bias in all its forms, leading to a more accurate under-
standing of the effects of medicines.
