PROTOCOL TITLE :A 12 Week, Multicentre, Open Label Stud y to Evaluate the Efficacy , 
Tolerability  and Safet y of a  Feso terodine Flexible Dose Regimen i n Patients with Overactive 
Bladder
Study Center s:  The study  was conducted at 39 centers in the United Kingdom.
Study Initiation Date and Completion  Dates:   07February 2009 to 14January 2010
Phase of Development :  Phase 4
Study Objectives :  The primary  objective was  to demonstrate the efficacy , in terms of 
reduction of micturitions, of 12 weeks flexible dose fesoterodine in subjects w ith overactive 
bladder  (OAB) compared with b aseline.
The secondary  objectives were to assess the use of flexible dosing of fesoterodine on other 
bladder diary  variables after 4 and 12 weeks compared to baseline, the effect of flexible dose 
fesoterodine on treatment satisfaction and health related qu ality of life (QoL) measures at 
12weeks compared to baseline, and the safet y and tolerability of flexible dose fesoterodine 
in subjects with OAB.
The exploratory  objectives were to analyze baseline data such as subject demographics, 
subject  reported outco mes and bladder diary  variables that could  predict dose escalation a fter 
4weeks , understand the impact of cessation of fesoterodine after 12 weeks of therap y and to 
explore the potential impact of fesoterodine upon goal achievement after 12 weeks of 
thera py.
METHODS
Study Design:   This was a single country , multi -center, open -label stud y which  aimed to 
enter 326 male and female subjects with  OAB sy mptoms from across the United Kingdom at 
approximately  41centers in primary  and secondary  care sites , with ea ch center  enrolling

Page 2approximately  8subjects .  The study  require d 5in-clinic visits in cluding the screening  visit, 
baseline/enrol lment visit, end of Week 4 visit , end of treatment visit ( Week 12), and a post 
treatment visit (Week 16).
Number of Subjects  (Planned and Analyzed): It was estimated that a sample size of 
277subjects would have been sufficient to provide 95% confidence intervals (CI s) of width 
no more than 0.38 with 80% coverage probability .  Allowing for a drop -out rate of 15%, a 
total of 326 subjects were required to be entered into the study .
All 331 subjects who were treated were included in the safet y anal ysis set and were anal yzed 
for adverse events ( AEs).  One subject was excluded from the full analy sis set (FAS)  because 
she did not have an y post -baseline efficacy  data for any  efficacy  endpoints .  A total of 
251subjects (75.8%) were included in the per protocol anal ysis set (PPAS).
Diagnosis and Main  Criteria for Inclusion:   Eligible subjects were male or female 
outpatients ≥18years old with OAB s ymptoms (subject -reported) for ≥3months prior to 
screening/Visit 1 according to International Continence Societ y guidelines, mean urinary  
frequency  of ≥8micturitions per 24 hours as verified by  the screening bladder diary  prior t o 
baseline/Visit 2, and mean number of urgency  episodes ≥3 per 24 hours as verified b y the 
screening bladder diary  prior to baseline/Visit 2 (urgency  episodes were defined as those 
with urinary  sensation scale [USS] rating ≥3).  Subjects with conditions that would 
contraindicate the usage of fesoterodine  orcould impact OAB sy mptoms, history  of urinary  
tract surgery , active bladder stones and urinary  tract infection were excluded from the study .
Study Treatment:   All entered subjects were  initially  treated with fesoterodine 4 mg once 
daily  for the first  4weeks of treatment.  At the end of Week 4, based upon a discussion 
between the subject and the investigator of efficacy  and tolerability  reported by  the subject, 
the investigator could  either increase the d ose to 8 mg for those subjects who desire d greater 
symptom improvement and report ed good tolerability , or could continue the subject on the 
4mg dose, for the remaining 8weeks of the study .  No dose adjustments we re allowed 
during the remaining 8weeks of  the tr eatment phase of the stud y. One tablet was to  be taken 
with water at approximately  the same time every  day.
Efficacy Evaluations:
Bladder Diary :
Each subject was to  com plete a bladder diary  for 3 consecutive day s immediately  preceding 
each clinic v isit to record details of micturitions (frequency , urgen cy, urgency  urinary  
incontinence  [UUI ]).

Page 3Questionnaires:
Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC) is a self -administered, single -item, v alidated 
questionnaire that asked  subjects to describe th eir perception of their bladder -related 
problems .  The PPBC was  administered at screening  (Visit 1), baseline  (Visit 2), Week 4 
(Visit 3), Week 12or early  termination  (Visit 4), and Week 16 (Visit 5).
Urgency  Perception Scale (UPS; formerl y referred to as Patient P erception of  Urgency  Scale) 
is a self -administered, single -item, valid ated questionnaire that measured  the subject’s 
perception of urinary  urgency .  It was  administered at baseline  (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 3),
andWeek 12or earl y termination  (Vis it4).
The Overactive Bladder -questionnaire (OAB -q) symptom bother scale consisting of 8 items
asked the subjects how much they  had been bothered by  selected bladder s ymptoms during 
the past 4 weeks.  It was administered at baseline  (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visi t3), and Week 12or 
early termination  (Visit 4).
The King’s Health Questionnaire (KHQ) is a self -administe red questionnaire containing 
21questions that are scored in 9 domains (general health perception, incontinence impact, 
role limitations, phy sical li mitations, social limitations, personal relationships, emotions, 
sleep/energy , severit y of urinary s ymptoms).  It was administered at baseline  (Visit 2), 
Week 4 (Visit 3), and Week 12or earl y termination  (Visit 4).
The International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire -Short F orm (ICIQ-SF) is a
brief and comprehensive subject -compl eted questionnaire containing 6 items for the 
assessment and quantification of incontinence a nd its impact on QoL .  It was  administered at 
baseline  (Visit 2) and at Week 12or early  termination  (Visit 4).
The Benefit , Satisfaction and Willingness to continue (BSW) is a 3 -item questionnaire 
designed to assess treatment benefit, subject satisfaction with treatment, and subject 
willingness to continue treatment .  It was  adminis tered at Week 12or earl y termination
(Visit 4).
Aninitial version of the Self Assessment Goal Achievement (SAGA ) questi onnaire, before 
the final validated version was available, was included in the study  as an exploratory  
endpoint. The SAGA questi onnair e is a subject -completed, phy sician -reviewed tool to assess 
treatment goals and achievement of go als for subjects suffering from OAB and/or other 
urinary  tract sy mptoms .SAGA First Assessment questionnaire was  provided to the subject s
at the end of screen ing visit , when the investigator took  the time to expla in the questionnaire.
The second part (SAGA Follow -up questionnaire) was  provided to the subject s along with 
their SAGA First Assessment finalized at baseline (Visit 2) (for reference).
The Treatment Satisfaction Question (TSQ) is a self -administered, 1 -item measure of subject 
satisfaction for subjects receiving treatment for OAB. The TSQ was administered at the end 
of study  at Week 12or early  termination  visit (Visit 4) to assess subject’s satisfact ion with 
current treatment of fesoterodine.

Page 4Safety Evaluations:   AEs were monitored throughout the study .A urine dipstick test for red 
blood cells, white blood cells, glu cose, protein, and nitrites was performed only at the 
screening  visit  for assessment  of study  entry  qualification.  A urine pregnancy  test 
(beta -human chorionic gonadotropin) was done for women of child bearing potential at 
screening  visit for assessment of study  inclusion criteria and at Week 12 (end of treatment 
visit).  Sitting blood p ressure and pulse rate were recorded at all visits including screening, 
baseline, Week 4, and Week 12 or earl y termination visit.
Statistical Methods:   All efficacy  parameters were anal yzed within the FAS.  I n addition, 
the primary  efficacy  endpoint was al so anal yzed using the PPAS.
The primary  efficacy  endpoint was the change in mea n number of micturitions (micturition 
frequency  [MF]) per 24 hours at Week 12 relative to baseline.   The mean MF per 24 hours 
was calculated as the sum of all micturitions divid ed by  the total number of diary  days 
collected at that visit.  The primary  endpoint was summarized using descriptive statistics, 
which included the number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, 
maximum and 95% CI.
The secondary  efficacy  endpoints based on the bladder diary  were: 
change in mean MF per 24 hours at Week 4 relative to baseline
percent change in MF at Weeks 4 and 12 relative to baseline
change  and percent change  in mean number of nocturnal micturitions  (nocturnal 
micturition fr equency  [NMF])  per 24 hours at Weeks 4 and 12 relative to baseline in 
subjects with >0 episodes during the 3 -day baseline diary  period
change and percent change in mean number of UUI episodes per 24 hours at Weeks 4 and 
12 relative to baseline in subjects with >0 UUI episodes during the 3 -day baseline diary  
period
change and percent change in mean number of urgency  episodes (urgency  episode 
frequency  [UEF]) per 24 hours at Weeks 4 and 12 relative to baseline
change and percent change in mean number of noctu rnal urgency  episodes (nocturnal 
urgency  episode frequency  [NUEF]) per 24 hours at Weeks 4 and 12 relative to baseline 
in subjects with >0 episodes during the 3 -day baseline diary  period
change and percent change in mean number of severe urgency  episodes (severe urgency  
episode frequency  [SUEF]) per 24 hours at Weeks 4 and 12 relative to baseline in 
subjects with >0 episodes during the 3 -day baseline diary  period
change in mean number of incontinence pads used per 24 hours at Weeks 4 and 12 
relative to base line.
To support the interpretation of the primary  analy sis, a secondary  anal ysis on the primary  
endpoint similar to the primary  anal ysis was to be conducted based upon the PPAS.  All

Page 5other secondary  diary  endpoints (both absolute and percent change) wer e summarized as 
continuous endpoints with summary  statistics provided for baseline and Weeks 4 and 12.  
These summary  statistics were also provided for numeric and percentage changes from 
baseline to Weeks 4 and 12.
The secondary  efficacy  endpoints based o n the questionnaires were:
change in PPBC at Weeks 4 and 12 relative to baseline
change in UPS  at Weeks 4 and 12 relative to baseline
change in OAB -q symptom bother and individual item (question) scores  at Week s4 and 
12 relative to baseline
change in tota l score of each domain and individual item (question) score at Week 12 
relative to baseline
change in ICIQ -SF and individual item (questions 1-3) scores at Week 12 relative to 
baseline
each BSW item and total score at Week 12
percentage of subjects reporti ng satisfaction (including ‘very  satisfied’ and ‘somewhat 
satisfied’) at Week 12.
The change from baseline to Weeks 4 and 12 in the PPBC were summarized.  Frequency  
tables and change from baseline frequency  tables were also presented.  Frequency  tables f or 
the UPS categories at each visit and change from baseline to Week 4 and Week 12 frequency  
tables were presented.  The change in the sy mptom severity /bother items and total of the 
OAB -q symptom bother scale at Week 4 and Week 12 relative to baseline was summarized.  
Absolute values and changes from baseline at Week 12 for each domain of the KHQ were 
summarized.  The changes from baseline in item scores of the ICIQ-SF at Week 12 were 
summarized.  Each item of the BSW and the total score at Week 12 were sum marized.  For 
the single item measur e of satisfaction from the TSQ , the score (very  dissatisfied to very 
satisfied) at Week 12 was summarized descriptively .  In addition ,the percent age of 
responde rs (ie,subject s who indicated being ‘Very  satisfied’  or ‘Somewhat satisfied’) was 
summarized at Week 12.
Endpoints based on changes  (absolute or percentage) from Week 12 (end of treatment) to 
Week 16 were evaluated  for exploratory  anal yses.
The proportion of subjects escalating from fesoterodine 4 mg to fesoterod ine 8mg at Week 4 
was summarized.  Logistic r egression anal ysis was used to explore the relationship between 
the final dose of fesoterodine (ie, whether subjects escalated to 8 mg or not) and 
screening/baseline factors , and other covariates , as follows:
Baseline mean number of micturitions per 24 hours

Age
Gender
BMI
Duration of OAB from the date of onset
Presence/ absence of anticholinergic AEs prior to Week 4
For the purposes of this analy sis, the PPBC responses at Week 4 were categorized into ‘no 
problems/some very  minor problem s’, ‘some minor problems’, ‘some moderate problems’ 
and ‘severe problems/many  severe problems’.  The reference category  for comparing the 
proportion titrating for this factor was ‘no problems/some very  minor problems’ and the odds 
of titrating for subjects  in this category  were compared to each of the other categories.  The 
factors OAB wet vs OAB dry,gender, p resence/ absence of anticholinergic AEs prior to Week 4
were modeled as binary  endpoints, and baseline and change from baseline to Week 4 in mean 
number  of micturitions per 24 hours, age, BM I and duration of OAB were modeled as 
continuous endpoints.
The covariate factors used in this analy sis were summarized for all subjects, split by  subjects 
who were dose titrated and n ot dose t itrated at Week 4.
Safety  data were  summ arized for all subjects included in the safet y analysis set .  All safet y 
data were summarized and listed according to the sponsor’s data standards.

Page 9At baseline , most subjects (with responses at Week 12) were not able to hold urine 
(81subjects [ 25.2%]) or were able to hold urine until they  reached a toilet but without 
finishing what they  were doing (2 21subjects [68. 8%]).  At Week 12, 1 54subjects ( 48.0%) 
had improvements in UPS compared to baseline.
At Week 12, there was a decrease  from baseline (ie, an indication of improvement) in the 
OAB -q Symptom Bother Score.  The mean  change from baseline to Week 12 was -37.25 
(95% CI :  -39.83, -34.66).   Changes from baseline in scores for individual questions were 
comparable, no individual question score was markedly  different.
At Week 12, there were decreases (ie, an indication of improvements) from baseline in all 
domains of the KHQ, with the greatest improvements for the Phy sical and Role L imitations 
domains .  Changes from baseline in scores for individual questions were comparable, no 
individual question score was markedl y differen t.
At Week 12, there was a decrease (ie, an indication of improvement) from baseline in the 
ICIQ-SF.  The mean change from baseline to Week 12 was -5.13 (95% CI:  -5.72, -4.54).  
Mean changes from baseline in individual scores were negative for individual  questions: 
frequency  (Question 1) and amount (Question 2) of urine leak, and how much leaking 
interfered with life (Question 3).
At Week 12, >50% of subjects reported the maximum categories of benefit (Question 1:  
‘much benefit’) and satisfaction (Questi on2:  ‘very  satisfied’) from treatment.  When 
subjects were asked to answer ‘y es’ or ‘no’ to whether they  were satisfied (Question 3) and 
willing to continue treatment (Question 5), >75% of subjects answered ‘y es’ to each 
question.  When the magnitude of subjects’ willingness to continue was categorized, >60% 
reported the maximum category  of ‘very  willing’.
The majority  of subjects (73.6%) reported satisfaction with study  treatment at Week 12.
Exploratory Results
At Week 16, for all micturition diary  varia bles there were deteriorations (increases in 
frequency ) from Week 12, ie, after the last  dose of fesoterodine was taken .
Of 307 subjects, 195 subjects had a dose increase from fesoterodine 4 mg to fesoterodine 
8mg at Week 4.  For 182 subjects the dose inc rease was due to insufficient clinical response 
and for 13 subjects the dose increase was for ‘other’ reasons.  Most of the dose increases 
(111/195 subjects) were as result of the subject making the decision assisted by  the 
investigator.  Dose increases al so occurred as a result of the subject (68 subjects) or 
investigator (12 subjects) making the decision, or due to ‘other’ reasons (4 subjects). 
The stepwise logistic regression identified the covariates of change from baseline in 
micturition per 24 hours at Week 4 and respons e to the PPBC questionnaire at Week 4 as 
most strongly  associated with whether a subject  titrated or not. The other factors tested in the 
stepwise logistic regression ( gender, age, BMI, presence or absence of anticholinergic AEs 
prior  to Week 4, baseline mea n number of micturitions per 24 hours, OAB wet/OAB dry and

Page 10duration  of OAB from the date of onset) were not found to be significant .  Response to the 
PPBC Questionnaire at Week 4 gave different results for the sub -group that titrated to 
fesoterodine 8 mg compared to the sub -group that did not; eg, of the subjects who were 
titrated , 50subjects (25.6%) had positive responses to ‘My  bladder condition causes me 
severe problems’ compared to 1 (0.9%) of the subjects who were not titrated.  Subjects who 
were titrated had more micturitions per 24 hours at Week 4 (mean=13.4; SD=3.75) than 
those who were not (mean=11.9; SD=2.98).
The most important goals at baseline , as identified by  subjects  in the SAGA questionnaire ,
were ‘ Reduce the sudden ne ed to rush to the bathroom ’, ‘Reduce frequency to the bathroom 
through the day ’ and ‘ Reduce frequency  to the bathroom at night’.  The  most frequ ently 
achieved goals at Week 12 were ‘ Reduce difficulty  starting or maintaining a urinary  stream ’, 
‘Reduce frequ ency  to the bathroom through the day’and ‘Reduce my urine leakage’ .  Nearl y 
50% of subjects (49.5 %) achieved the  goal that was rated ‘Most Important Goal’, and 81.0% 
‘Somewhat achieved goals’ or better .
Benefit of treatment with fesoterodine, was generall y observed across all subjects for Fixed 
Total Score, Global Total Score,  as well as OAB symptom -related Fixed Total Score and 
Global Total Score - derived from the SAGA  questionnaire.  The mean scores at Week 12 
ranged between 47.62 and 48.63 .
As per the TSQ, the majority  of subjects reported satisfaction with the OAB medication 
(fesoterodine).  There was a  high correlation between the SAGA questionnaire (o verall 
achievement of goals)  and the TSQ .
Safety Results:   An overview of AE experience during the st udy is provided in Table 3.  A 
total of 605 AEs were reported by  254 subjects, and 295 AEs reported b y 159subjects were 
considered treatment -related.  T he most commonly  reported all -causality  AEs were dry  
mouth (99 subjects [29.9 %]), constipation (30 subjects [9.1%]) and diarrhea (29 subjects 
[8.8%]) ( Table 4).  The majority  of the most commonly  reported AEs were considered 
treatment -related.

Page 12Twenty -nine subjects (8.8%) experienced AEs that led to permanent study  discontinuation; 
for 25subjects (7.6%) these AEs were considered  treatment -related .  AEs leading to 
discontinuation that were experienced b y mo re than 1 subject were dry  mouth (10 subjects), 
dizziness (4 subjects), headache (3 subjects), nausea (3 subjects), constipation (2 subjects), 
pollakiuria (2 subjects), and dy spepsia (2 subjects).
Fourteen subjects (4.2%) experienced AEs that led to tempor ary study discontinuation or 
dose reduction; for 4 subjects (1.2%) AEs were considered treatment -related.   AEs  leading to 
temporary  discontinuation or dose reduction that were experienced by  more than 1 subject 
were diarrhea (4 subjects), dry mouth  (2subjects) and lab yrinthitis (2 subjects).
One subject died post -study  treatment.  A  76-year-old male  died post -study  treatment due to 
a ruptured atheromatous aneury sm of the thoracic aorta, which was not considered 
treatment -related .
All serious AEs ( SAEs ) are listed by  subjec t in Table 5.  Eleven subjects  (3.3%) experienced 
at least 1 treatment -emergent SAE, including 3 subjects  (0.9%)  who experienced SAEs
considered treatment -related.  All SAEs r esolved by  the end of the study  with t he exception 
of 1SAE which was fatal .

Serious adverse event presentations were derived from a combination of data contained within the clinical  study 
database and the corporate safety database.  The corporate safety database was a separate, centralized, adverse 
event monitoring database that w as continuously updated based on rapidly communicated reports from the 
investigators to th e sponsor.  The clinical study database was based on information provided from the 
CRFs/DCTs. Consequently, occasional differences in data may exist between the centralized safety database 
and the clinical study database .

Mean chan ges from baseline in sitting sy stolic blood pressure, sitting diastolic blood 
pressure, and sitting pulse rate were small.  Nine subjects (2.8%) had an increase in sitting 
systolic blood pressure ≥30mmHg, and 7 subjects (2.1%) had an increase in sitting diastolic 
blood pressure ≥20mmHg.  Five subjects experienced increase d blood pressure during the 
study , which was reported as an AE; 1 subject experienced increased blood pressure that was 
reported as a treatment -related AE.  There were no other safet y concerns for vital signs.
CONCLUSIONS :
The primary  objective was to demonstrate the efficacy  of 12 weeks flexible dose 
fesoterodine in subjects with OAB, in terms of a reduction from baseline in MF, and as a 
secondary  objective, in terms of reductions in bl adder diary  variables (NMF, UUI, UEF, 
NUEF and SUEF).  Results demonstrated that fesoterodine was efficacious in reducing 
MF and other bladder diary  variables  from baseline to Week 12.

Page 14The assessment of the effect of flexible dose fesoterodine on treatment satisfaction and 
health -related QoL measures at 12 weeks compared to baseline showed that the majority  
of subjects were satisfied with their treatment.
A flexible dose regime of fesote rodine was safe and well tolerated.  Overall, the safet y 
data were consistent to those observed in prior fesoterodine studies and reported in the 
label for the OAB population:
The most commonly  reported all -causality  AEs were dry  mouth, constipation and 
diarrhea; which are generally  expected for this compound and population.  There 
were no reported events of urinary  retention.
Twenty -nine subjects (8.8%) experienced AEs that led to permanent study  
discontinuation; for 25 subjects (7.6%) AEs were considered treatment -related .
Eleven subjects (3.3%) experienced at least 1 treatment -emergent SAE, including 
3subjects who experienced treatment -related SAEs.  All SAEs resolved by  the end of 
the study  with the exception of 1 SAE which was fatal.
Exploratory  anal yses to understand the impact of cessation of fesoterodine after 12 weeks 
of therap y showed that for all micturition diary variables there were deteriorations 
(increases in frequency ) after Week 12, ie, after the last dose of fesoterodine was taken.
Explorat ory analysis of dose titration data showed that the 2 factors that were most 
strongl y associated with titration from fesoterodine 4 mg to fesoterodine 8 mg at Week 4 
were change from baseline in MF and subject response to the PPBC questionnaire at 
Week 4. 
The exploratory  SAGA questionnaire, used in this study  to evaluate subjects’ treatment 
goals with r egard to their bladder problems, showed that 49.5 % of subjects achieved the 
goal that was rated ‘Most I mportant Goal’ ,and 81.0% ‘Somewhat achieved goals’ or 
better.
