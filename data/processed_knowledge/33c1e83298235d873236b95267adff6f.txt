NATIONAL CLINICAL TRIAL NO .: NCT00691483
PROTOCOL NO. : A3051095 
PROTOCOL TITLE :Phase 4, Prospective, Multi -National, Randomized,  Double -Blind, 
Placebo -Controlled Study  to Evaluate Smoking Cessation with Varenicline Tartrate 
Compared with Placebo in the Setting of Patient Self -Selected (Flexible) Quit Date
Study Center(s) :  33 in 14 countries (Argentina  [1], Brazil  [1], Canada  [2], China  [3], Czech 
Republic  [2], France  [1], German y [2], Hungary  [2], Italy [1], Republic of Korea  [2], Mexico
[1], Taiwan  [2], United Kingdom  [1], United States  (US) [12])
Study Initiation Date and Primary Completion  or Completion  Dates:   
22September 2008 to 10 December 2009 
Phase of Development :  Phase  4
Study Objective(s):   The primary  efficacy  objective of this protocol was to compare 
12weeks of treatment with varenicline 1 mg twice daily  (BID) to placebo for smoking 
cessation in the setting of a su bject self -selected quit date (before Week 5 visit), and to 
evaluate continuous abstinence (CA) from smoking for 12 weeks after the treatment period.  
Additional secondary  objectives were to compare treatments for urge to smoke, smoking 
satisfaction, and the ps ychological reward over time in subjects in the US by  anal yses of the 
results from the Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale (MNWS) and the Modified Cigarette 
Evaluation Questionnaire (mCEQ) , respectivel y.  
The safet y objective was to gather safety da ta for 12 weeks of treatment with varenicline 
1mg BID or placebo followed b y 12 weeks of non -treatment follow -up, and to evaluate 
safet y and tolerability when used in the setting of a subject self selected quit date.
METHODS
Study Design:   This was a rand omized, double blind, placebo -controlled, multinational study

Page 2cessation.  The stud y consisted of a 12 -week treatment phase followed b y a 12-week 
non-treatment phase for a to tal study  duration of 24 weeks.  Approximately 652 subjects (at 
least 489 varenicline and 163 placebo) were to be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive either 
varenicline (1 -week titration followed by  11 weeks of 1 mg BID treatment) or placebo.  
Blinded stu dy medication was discontinued at the Week 12 visit and was followed by  a 
non-treatment period to Week 24.  Subjects were to self -select a quit date to occur between 
Day 8 (the date of dose escalation to 1 mg BID) and the Week 5 visit day .  The Week 1 visi t 
occurred at the end of the first week of treatment.  Subjects were to return for clinic visits at 
Weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 during the treatment period.  During the 
non-treatment follow -up, subjects were to return for visits at Weeks 13 , 16, 20 and 24, and 
were contacted b y phone at Weeks 14, 18 and 22.  Each subject received brief smoking 
cessation counseling, consistent with the Agency  for Healthcare Research and Quality  
(AHRQ) guidelines or similar local guidelines at each clinic visi t and at each telephone 
contact starting with the baseline visit.  At the baseline visit, subjects also received an 
educational booklet about smoking cessation.
Number of Subjects  (Planned and Analyzed):   It was planned to randomize at least 
652subjects t o varenicline or placebo in a 3:1 ratio.  Four hundred and ninety  three (493) 
subjects were assigned to varenicline and 166 to placebo.  Of these, 486 and 165 were treated 
with at least 1 dose of varenicline and placebo, respectivel y.
Diagnosis and Main Cr iteria for Inclusion:   Subjects were eligible for enrollment into the 
study  if they  were current cigarette smokers between 18 and 7 5 years of age and motivated to 
stop smoking .  Subjects had to have smoked an average of at least 10 cigarettes per day  
durin g the past y ear and during the month prior to the screening visit, with no continuous 
period of abstinence greater than 3 months in the past y ear.  In addition, subjects were not to 
have had serious or unstable disease within the past 6 months .
Study Treat ment:   Subjects were randomized to receive either blinded varenicline or 
placebo.  Subjects randomized to varenicline were titrated to the full dose during the first 
week in the following manner: 0.5 mg once dail y (QD) x 3 days followed by 0.5 mg BID x 
4days, and then 1 mg BID for 11 weeks. During the non -treatment follow -up period from 
Week 13 to Week 24, subjects did not receive study  medication.   Tablets (blinded varenicline 
or placebo) were supplied in bottles containing sufficient tablets for 1week. Varenicline was
supplied as 0.5 mg tablets for the first week and 1.0 mg tablets for the remaining 11 weeks of 
the study  treatment period.
Efficacy Evaluations:   Efficacy  data were collected using the Nicotine Use Inventory  (NUI) 
and exhaled CO measureme nts.  NUI was also completed at all telephone contacts.  Data on 
quitting plans and quit attempts (defined as quitting smoking for at least a few hours with the 
conviction to quit permanently ) occurring during the first 5weeks of the study  were also 
colle cted using the Plan and Quit Questionnaire .  The MNWS was used  to assess craving and 
nicotine withdrawal s ymptoms.   The rewarding effects associated with smoking were 
measured with the mCEQ.  The MNWS and the mCEQ were administered at the baseline 
visit an d weekly  through Week 12 to subjects enrolled in US centers onl y.

Page 3Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, and/or Other Evaluations:   This study  included the 
collection of a single blood sample for de -identified pharmacogenomic studies. Participation 
in this co mponent of the study  was voluntary  and required a separate informed consent.  
Pharmacogenomic anal yses were described in a separate protocol and were not part of this 
study  report . 
Safety Evaluations:   Safety  was evaluated based on adverse events (AEs), vital signs, 
physical examination, body  weight and height, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and laboratory  
test results.   Throughout the study , the Columbia Suicide Severity  Rating Scale  (C-SSRS) 
was administered to evaluate suicidal ideation and behavior .  The Patient Health 
Questionnaire (PHQ -9) was used at each clinic visit or telephone assessment to evaluate 
depression .
Statistical Methods :  The All Subjects population was defined as all subjects who received 
at least 1 dose, including partial doses, of rando mized study  medication.  The All Subjects 
population was the primary  population for efficacy  and safet y analyses in this study .  
Analy ses of the Evaluable Subjects population (all subjects who took at least 14 day s of 
study  medication in the first 21 day s of the study ), Completers population  (all subjects who 
had at least 80% treatment compliance), and intention -to-treat ( ITT)population  (all 
randomized subjects) were intended to support the robustness of the conclusions made on the 
All Subjects population.
The int ent of the primary anal ysis wa s to evaluate the hy pothesis that varenicline  is superior 
to placebo  for smoking cessation after 12 weeks of treatment , when used in a setting where 
subject sare given some discretion regard ing setting their own quit d ate. The primary  efficacy  
endpoint was the CO -confirmed 4 -week CQR for Weeks 9 through 12, inclusive.  The key  
secondary  efficacy  endpoint was the continuous abstinence rate (CA R) from Weeks 9 
through 24 .  
Other secondary  efficacy endpoints included CO -confirmed and non -CO-confirmed long 
term quit rate (LTQR) from  Weeks 9 through 24 , 7-day point prevalence o f smoking 
cessation at Weeks 12 and 24 , 4-week point prevalence of smoking cessation at Week 24 , 
non-CO-confirmed 4 -week CQR for Weeks 9 through 12 , and endpoints related to plans for 
or times of smoking quit attempts. Patient -reported outcomes (PRO) endpoints included data 
from the MNWS and the mCEQ with focus on the Urge -to-Smoke item of the MNWS 
(baseline and weekl y through Week 12) and the Smoking S atisfaction and Psy chological 
Reward domains of the mCEQ (baseline and weekly  through Week 12).
A planned sample size of 652 subjects randomized to varenicline or placebo in a 3:1 ratio 
(489 varenicline and 163 placebo) was to provide at least 90% power to  detect a difference in 
the primary  endpoint between the varenicline and placebo groups, assuming a true 
Week s9to12 CAR of 0.24 and 0.46 for placebo and varenicline, respectively  (odds ratio 
[OR] of at least 2.67).  This sample size also provided at lea st 90% power to detect a 
difference between varenicline and placebo in the secondary  endpoint Week s 9 to 24 CAR, 
assuming a true Week s 9 to 24 CAR of 0.18 and 0.31 for placebo and varenicline, 
respectivel y (OR of at least 2.10).

Page 4Mean, median, standard devi ation, and range were used to summarize continuous variables, 
and counts and percentages were used to summarize categorical variables.  For binary  
efficacy  endpoints, statistical inference was based on logistic regression models with main 
effect of treatme nt as the explanatory  variable and investigative center as covariate.  This
statistical methodology  was used for anal yzing the primary  and key  secondary  efficacy  data .
For the time -to-event endpoint, statistical inference was based on the Kaplan -Meier meth od 
with treatment groups as strata.  For continuous PRO endpoints, statistical inference was 
based on a linear repeated measures model with covariates in harmon y with those used to 
control the anal ysis of the primary  endpoint.   
All statistical testing was  2-sided and used a 0.05 level of significance.   In order to preserve 
the ty pe I famil y-wise error rate of 0.05, a step -down procedure was used for the anal ysis of 
the primary  and key  secondary  endpoint.  The hierarchy  of comparisons was 1) the 4 -week 
CQR for Weeks 9 through 12 and then 2) the CA at Week 24.  Statistical significance was 
declared for each h ypothesis in the ordered list until a p -value >0.05 was obtained, at which 
point the hy pothesis was declared to not be statistically  significant.   The p -values for 
analyses of the secondary  endpoints, other than the key  secondary  endpoint, were reported 
with no adjustments for multiplicity .
An addition al sensitivity  anal ysis was performed on the primary  and key  secondary  anal yses 
to assess the impact of ex cluding 18 subjects with unreliable data who were randomized at 
investigational center  1032 .
All subjects in the All Subjects population were included in the safety  anal ysis.  Safety data 
were presented using descriptive statistics.
RESULTS
Subject Dispo sition and Demography:   Subject disposition and data sets are summarized in 
Table 1.  Subjects were encouraged to remain in the study  if they  discontinued treatment in 
order to provide data for smoking status and other outcomes.  Table 1 consequently  provides

a Discontinuations from the study could occur during the treatment period or during the post -
therapy follow -up period , i.e. subjects discontinuing treatment were not necessarily also 
discontinuing the study .
b Subjects could discontinue from treatmen t and remain in the study.
Most of the subjects in either treatment group (60%) were male.  The mean age for the 
varenicline group was 43.9 y ears and ranged from 18 to 75 y ears.  The mean age of the 
placebo group was 43.2 years and ranged from 18 to 72 years.  The average body  mass 
indices ( BMIs) were 26.2kg/m2 and 26.7 kg/m2 for the varenicline and placebo groups, 
respectivel y.  The distribution of races was similar in both treatment groups, with subjects in 
both groups being mostl y White.

Efficacy Results:  An overview of the primary  and the key  secondary  endpoint  is given in 
Table 3.
Analy ses of smoking ces sation rates for the All Subjects population showed that varenicline 
was more efficacious than placebo in all measures of abstinence, both at the end of the 12 -
week treatment period and during the non -treatment follow -up through Week 24. Statistical 
signif icance in favor of varenicline treatment was reached for the primary  and the key  
secondary  endpoints (all p <0.0001).

CA = continuous abstinence, CI = confidence interval, CO=carbon monoxide, CQR = continuous quit 
rate, N = number of subjects in respective treatmen t group , ppm = parts per million .
n (CQR) = the number of subjects who, at each visit from Week 9 through 12 (inclusive), reported no 
smoking and no use of other nicotine -containing products since the last study visit (on the Nicotine 
Use Inventory) and wh o did not have CO >10 ppm at any of these visits; 
n (CA) = number of subjects who at each contact from Week s 9 to 24 , reported no smoking and no use of 
other nicotine -containing products (treatment phase) or tobacco products (non -treatment phase) since 
the last study contact (on the Nicotine Use Inventory) and who did not have CO >10 ppm at the clinic 
visit.
The LTQR at Week 24 was also statistically  significantly  higher in the varenicline group than 
in the placebo group ( OR: 4.91 ( 95% confidence interva l [CI] 2.96, 8.13) , p<0.0001 ).  Other 
results for abstinence endpoints were consistent with the results above.  Significantly  greater 
abstinence rates for the varenicline group were observed for the 7 -day point prevalence of 
abstinence at all time points (Week 12: OR 5.66 ( 95% CI  3.66, 8.75) , p<0.0001, Week 24: 
OR: 4.12 ( 95% CI  2.58, 6.58) , p<0.0001), and for the 4 -week point prevalence of abstinence 
at Week 24 ( 4.14 ( 95% CI 2.58, 6.67) , p<0.0001).
Subjects in the varenicline group made their first quit  attempt statistically  significantly  earlier 
(p=0.0074 ) compared with subjects in the placebo group , with the  median 17 days versus 
24days, respectively .  Two hundred and fort y five ( 245) (50.4%) subjects in the varenicline 
group made a first quit attem pt during Week 1 and Week 2 compared with 62 (37.6%) 
subjects in the placebo group.  
At all weekl y time points from Week 1 through Week 12, MNWS scores for Urge to Smoke
and mCEQ scores for Satisfaction were lower for varenicline than for placebo , but onl y 
marginally  lower for mCEQ Psychological Reward .

bBased on Administration Schedule .
c Causality according to investigator.
d Reported after the 28 day collection period for SAEs and included in study database .  Since the event occurred 
  after the 28 day reporting period and w as considered unrelated to the investigational product, it was classified as 
  ‘invalid’ in the safety database. 
eThe sponsor  concluded that the syncope was not related to varenicline tr eatment and that the presence of risk
  factors like smoking, diabetes and a predisposing condition of coronary artery disease had played a contributory 
  role to the syncope.  
f This event was included in the summary of treatment -emergent SAEs (occurren ce 29 days post dose) that w as
  based on the study database .
gThis SAE was recorded as related to study drug in statistical outputs based on the clinical database .  In statistical 
  outputs based on the safety database, the event was assessed as   unrel ated according to follow -up information
 received from the investigator. 
MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, SAE = serious adverse event.
The results from laboratory , body  weight, vital signs, ECG, and phy sical examination did not 
raise an y safet y concerns. 
CONCLUSION(S):   This 12 -week stud y comparing varenicline 1 mg BID with placebo for 
smoking cessation in the setting of a subject self -selected quit date with a 12 -week follow -up 
period demonstrated that:
Varenicline treatment comp ared to placebo treatment resulted in statistically significantl y 
higher abstinence rates as measured b y the primary efficacy  endpoint CO -confirmed 
4-week CQR .  Varenicline treatment also achieved statistically  significantly higher 
abstinence rates as evid enced b y the parameters CA R Weeks 9 to 24 , LTQR at Week 24 ,

Page 127-day point prevalence of abstinence at Weeks 12 and 24 , and the 4 -week point 
prevalence of abstinence at Week 24.  Varenicline statistically  significantly  reduced the 
Urge to Smoke based on the MNWS and the Satisfaction from Smoking based on the 
mCEQ , when compared to placebo .  
Varenicline was safe and well tolerated.  There were relatively  few discontinuations due 
to AEs.  The most frequently  occurring AE in the varen icline group assessed as 
treatment -related was nausea, which was generally  mild to moderate in intensity  and 
infrequentl y resulted in treatment discontinuation.  The majority of SAEs were not 
assessed as treatment -related.
