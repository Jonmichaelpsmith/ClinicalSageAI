Pragmatic clinical trials (PCTs) have received increased attention within health services and 
pharmacy practice research due to their ability to test interventions in the real world, with 
emphasis on implementation and scalability in diverse practice environments. The purpose 
of this article is to introduce the PCT research design to health service and pharmacy 
practice researchers, followed by considerations and recommendations for conducting 
successful PCT research. It is organized into three parts, including a definition of PCTs, 
the process of selecting a PCT design, and general considerations and recommendations 
of PCTs. We conclude with the applications and trends in the use of PCTs in pharmacy 
research.
Part 1. Defining Pragmatic Trials
PCTs are conducted to answer the important question of how a treatment or intervention 
works in a normal, “real-world scenario” using a heterogeneous “real-world population” 
to test the effects ( Gamerman et al. 2019 ). While no consistent definition exists in the 
literature, there are a number of study elements that are often used to define PCTs. 
First, study participant eligibility requires little selection outside the clinical indication 
of interest. PCTs have minimal subject inclusion and exclusion criteria since the design 
is meant to reflect the population for which the intervention or treatment is intended. 
Second, it is important that the study setting, including clinicians, clinical staff, patients, and 
other stakeholders involved in the intervention or treatment, are reflective of the naturally 
occurring environment and organizational structure. Finally, PCTs can be identified by the 
types of outcomes and endpoints of interest, focusing on the data that is readily available and 
collected within the context of routine care.

Differences between Pragmatic and Explanatory Trials
Two statisticians, Daniel Schwartz and Joseph Lellouch, designated the two types of 
randomized clinical trials (RCTs) as ‘explanatory’ and ‘pragmatic’ ( Schwartz & Lellouch 
1967 ). In their 1967 paper, they described the explanatory approach to clinical trials as 
one which focuses on determining if a difference exists between two treatments, and the 
pragmatic approach as one focused on providing results that are more applicable to clinical 
practice and decision making ( Schwartz & Lellouch 1967 ).
While an explanatory study is highly controlled in terms of the research environment as 
well as what groups of individuals are exposed to the treatment or intervention, a pragmatic 
trial depicts more normal or ‘real life’ conditions ( McMahon 2002 ). General differences 
between traditional, explanatory RCTs and PCTs are presented in Table 1 (Weinfurt 2021). 
Explanatory studies focus results on outcomes or endpoints that are relatively unaffected by 
the context and health systems that patients may be exposed to. As a result, explanatory 
trials often lack generalizability to routine clinical practice ( Sedgwick 2014 ), whereas 
pragmatic trials, which are undertaken in the typical conditions of the healthcare system 
in which stakeholders work ( Zwarenstein 2017 ), are generalizable to clinical practice.
Contextualizing pragmatic trials within a broader spectrum of possible 
research designs
Research designs often used in pharmacy practice research include, but are not limited 
to, experimental, quasi-experimental, observational, qualitative, and mixed method designs 
(Awaisu et al. 2019 ). Experimental research designs are used to evaluate cause and effect 
relationships between a set of independent and dependent variables as shown in Figure 
1 below ( Portney 2020 ). PCTs largely fall within the category of experimental research 
designs, characterized by the random assignment of participants to at least two comparison 
groups ( Portney 2020 ). Some may also fall within the category of exploratory trials, which 
are observational and seek to find relationships between variables ( Portney 2020 ).
Differentiating Experimental Research Designs (Pragmatic Clinical Trials) 
from other Research Designs Used in Pharmacy Practice Research
Experimental research designs, including PCTs, differ from other research designs used in 
pharmacy practice. Quasi-experimental designs, for instance, are similar to experimental 
designs in structure, but do not involve randomization, making them useful when 
randomization is either impossible or unethical ( Portney 2020 ). Observational designs, 
unlike experimental and quasi-experimental designs, do not involve any experimentation 
but may be used to find relationships among variables and develop hypotheses which can 
be tested using PCTs ( National Institutes of Health 2016 ). Mixed method designs integrate 
both qualitative (descriptive) and quantitative elements, making them a good study design 
for conducting experiments quantitatively and describing populations qualitatively.
In pharmacy practice research, commonly used mixed method designs include the 
concurrent or convergent parallel design, exploratory sequential design, explanatory Oche et al. Page 2

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
sequential design, and the embedded design ( Hadi et al. 2013 , Pluye & Hong 2014 ). The 
choice of one type of mixed methods design over another depends on the research question 
being answered or the outcome that is desired. For instance, where a research question 
requires first collecting data using a quantitative method, followed by an explanation of 
that data using a qualitative method, an explanatory sequential design will be the design of 
choice ( Creswell 2014 ).
Important standards to know when conducting pragmatic trials
The Pragmatic–Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary tool (PRECIS-2)
Although clinical trials can be pragmatic or explanatory, most are a continuum and tend 
to have components of both elements in varying degrees ( Williams et al. 2015 ). The 
nine-domain PRECIS tool (PRECIS-2 wheel) was developed to guide researchers into 
prospectively determining the extent to which their trials are pragmatic or explanatory in 
nature ( Loudon et al. 2015 ).
According to the article by Loudon and others ( Loudon et al. 2015 ), these domains 
include eligibility (the basis for trial participant selection), recruitment (manner of recruiting 
participants), setting (trial location), organization (expertise and resources required for 
intervention delivery), flexibility-delivery (manner of intervention delivery), flexibility-
adherence (ways to ensure adherence to the intervention), follow-up (close monitoring), 
primary outcome (the extent of relevance), and primary analysis (the extent of data 
inclusion). In the PRECIS-2 wheel, each domain is scored on an explanatory-pragmatic 
scale from 1 (very explanatory) to 5 (very pragmatic).
The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)
The CONSORT Group developed the CONSORT Statement to address challenges 
associated with the inadequate reporting of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The focus 
of the statement is on reducing bias (internal validity), while improving a trial result’s 
applicability, that is, generalizability or external validity ( Zwarenstein et al. 2008 ).
According to the article by Schulz and others ( Schulz et al. 2010 ), the statement consists of 
minimum recommendations for trial reporting in a complete and clear manner, facilitating 
thorough analysis and subsequent interpretation. The evidence-based CONSORT statement 
consists of a 25-item checklist and a flow diagram with information on the design, analysis, 
and interpretation of a trial (found in the checklist), as well as the progress of all participants 
through the trial (found in the flow diagram). Often, journals require authors to include the 
CONSORT diagram and checklist when submitting a manuscript for RCTs.
Part 2. Selecting A PCT Design
Clinical trial study designs include parallel group, cross-over, factorial, cluster randomized 
trial, equivalence trial, and adaptive trial designs ( Greenberg 2015 ). In addition, the stepped 
wedge design has become increasingly used in pharmacy practice research. A brief but 
concise description of these designs, including their use, advantages, and disadvantages is 
illustrated in Table 2.Oche et al. Page 3
J Am Coll Clin Pharm . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 January 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
Important factors that guide the choice of a study design include the type of research 
question or research hypothesis, expertise of the investigator, availability of data, and 
funding opportunities ( Awaisu et al. 2019 ). In pharmacy practice research clinical trials, 
factors to consider when selecting a study design include the number and characteristics 
of treatments to be compared, characteristics of the disease under study, study objectives, 
timeframe, treatment course and duration, carry over effects, duration of the study, cost and 
logistics, patient convenience, ethical considerations, statistical considerations, study subject 
availability, and inter and intra subject variability ( Nair 2019 ).
Although many different study designs can be used to conduct PCTs as shown in Table 2, 
it is important that their characteristics help to answer the research question in the mind of 
a researcher determining which one to use. For instance, where two or more interventions 
can be given concurrently, the factorial or parallel arm design would be deemed appropriate 
(Nair 2019 ). On the other hand, when the time between inclusion of subjects into a study 
and assessment of the results is short compared with the time taken to recruit study subjects, 
the adaptive design would be considered suitable ( Nair 2019 ).
Part 3: General Considerations and Recommendations of PCTs
When conducting PCTs in pharmacy practice research, recognizing certain considerations 
and recommendations from successful PCT researchers or studies can be invaluable. 
Gamerman and others ( Gamerman et al. 2019 ), describe the 4 key design elements that 
should be considered minimum requirements of a PCT, including: 1) enrolling a real-world 
population; 2) conducting the trial in a real-world setting; 3) capturing relevant outcomes 
important to inform optimal healthcare treatment decisions; and 4) using an appropriate 
comparison arm ( Gamerman et al. 2019 ).
1) Enrolling a real-world population
An ideal PCT is described as one which reflects the population for which the treatment is 
intended, is conducted at a high standard of quality, has a control group which receives an 
acceptable standard of care, and produces outcomes that are meaningful ( Ford & Norrie 
2016 ; Godwin et al. 2003 ).
2) Conducting the trial in a real-world setting
According to Margolis and others ( Margolis et al. 2020 ), important design elements of 
a PCT include broad eligibility with few exclusions, an intention-to-treat analysis (which 
means that all participants are analyzed on the basis of the group to which they were 
randomized and not on the basis of their treatment adherence), and recruitment through 
usual clinic appointments.
Also, in their 2016 article ( Ford and Norrie 2016 ), the authors draw attention to the 
challenges of enrolling trial participants, as many clinical trial subjects are comparatively 
healthier than the general population, making generalizing the results quite futile. To 
increase the number and representativeness of the sample, they suggest using financial 
incentives, minimizing inclusion and exclusion criteria, and reducing the number and 
complexity of study visits, procedures, and questionnaire burden.Oche et al. Page 4

3) Capturing relevant outcomes important to inform optimal healthcare treatment 
decisions
Outcomes of interest in clinical trials include morbidity, mortality, functional status, quality 
of life, and resource use and costs ( Welsing et al. 2017 ). Consideration should be given 
to the appropriate selection of outcomes considered relevant for stakeholders (including 
administration, patients, and providers), and supportive of clinical decision-making.
4) Using an appropriate comparison arm
In PCTs, arms refer to groups of participants that either receive or do not receive 
an intervention. Experimental arms, which receive the intervention, are compared to 
control arms which might be active (receiving an active therapy) or placebo (receiving 
an inactive therapy). Selecting an appropriate comparison arm is important because it 
provides information that allows relevant treatment decisions to be made for patients 
seen subsequently ( Gamerman et al. 2019 ). To ensure comparability in treatment arms, 
and maximize external validity (generalizability), while not compromising internal validity, 
randomization is often used ( Godwin et al. 2003 ).
Statistical Considerations— In addition to the general considerations discussed above, 
there are also statistical considerations that researchers in pharmacy practice research should 
recognize when conducting PCTs. These include the determination of an end point, the 
establishment of an effect size, and the determination of power, error rates, and sample size 
(Zabor et al. 2020 ). These are briefly discussed below.
End point:  In selecting an end point, it is important to consider outcomes that can be 
measured objectively to enable comparison between control and experimental groups ( Zabor 
et al. 2020 ). The end point can be routinely obtained from usual practice such as Electronic 
Health Records ( Gamerman et al. 2019 ). Examples of end points include morbidity and 
survival.
Effect Size:  Effect sizes represent the difference between the present result and the desired 
outcome. They can also be used to estimate the sample size and hypothesis required for 
the study. Although the hypothesis can either be one or two-sided, a two-sided hypothesis 
(which identifies the difference from a hypothesized value in either direction), gives a good 
measure of the effect of the intervention, but may require a larger sample size, unlike the 
one-sided hypothesis (which identifies the difference from a hypothesized value in one 
direction only) for which a smaller sample size may be sufficient ( Zabor et al. 2020 ).
Power and Error rates:  Statistical Power is defined as the probability of detecting a 
treatment effect or the ability of a study to detect a true difference between groups when the 
treatment really works ( Waning & Montagne 2000 ). It is given by 1-Beta ( β) where Beta is a 
type II error (when a study does not find a difference between treatment groups, although a 
difference actually exists).
Power calculation can be done prospectively or retrospectively, and is determined by certain 
factors, including the statistical test in use, the effect size, sample attributes, and the level of Oche et al. Page 5

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript
power considered acceptable ( Houser 2007 ). The conventional standard for power in clinical 
trials is 80 percent (0.8), with Beta at 20 percent ( Prajapati et al. 2010 ).
Sample size:  An adequate sample size is important in pragmatic trials for the results to 
be generalizable and for long-term follow-up to account for patients who drop out of the 
study ( MacPherson 2004 ). According to Kirby and others ( Kirby et al. 2002 ), the factors 
influencing sample size calculation in a clinical study include i) power (usually set at 80% 
but could be set at 90% for large trials), ii) significance level (the 1% or 5% chance of 
reporting a significant effect in error), iii) the rate of event occurrence in the population (this 
can be estimated from previous studies), and iv) the treatment effect size (the difference 
in the event rate with and without the intervention). The sample size increases at smaller 
significance levels and higher power, and is inversely proportional to the square of the 
intervention-induced difference ( Kirby et al. 2002 ).
Applications and trends in the use of PCTs in Pharmacy
PCTs have been used in different types of pharmacy studies as shown in Table 3. One 
particular study design, the stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial, has been used in 
pharmacy practice research in areas such as medication safety and adherence, as well as 
in evaluation, comparative, and intervention studies ( Hemming et al. 2015 ). Although still 
a relatively new design, it is becoming quite popular as it has several advantages over the 
parallel cluster randomized trial design, including its usefulness where there are political, 
ethical, and logistical concerns ( Hemming et al. 2015 ).
The following examples (medication adherence, comparative, and intervention) show studies 
in pharmacy practice research that have utilized a pragmatic approach. In a medication 
adherence study by Gong and others ( Gong et al. 2016 ), telephone-based enhanced 
pharmacy care was compared to usual care for smoking cessation. The study design 
involved randomizing qualified participants - patients recently prescribed smoking cessation 
medication) into two groups - enhanced pharmacy care (EPC) and usual care (UC) and 
utilizing pharmacists to provide telephone counseling sessions to only the EPC group. 
The study results indicated that a pharmacist-enhanced program may benefit smokers by 
increasing adherence to prescription medications for smoking cessation.
In a comparative PCT study by Radley and others, ( Radley et al. 2020 ), the clinical 
effectiveness of a pharmacist-led antiviral treatment for hepatitis C virus was tested against 
conventionally delivered treatment in patients receiving opioid substitution therapy. This 
study used a cluster-randomized trial design in which pharmacies were randomized into the 
two groups (with patients receiving either a pharmacist-led intervention or conventionally 
delivered treatment). The study results found more accessible testing and high treatment 
success rates were obtained when pharmacists were used.
An intervention PCT study by Evans and others ( Evans et al. 2010 ) evaluated the impact 
of a community pharmacy intervention on statin adherence, through the integration of a 
cluster randomization and an outcome evaluation design. The study combined the rigor of a 
randomized trial with the pragmatism of collecting results in community pharmacy settings, Oche et al. Page 6

a novel idea which could set a precedent for future research study designs in the area of 
medication adherence, and possibly other areas of pharmacy practice research.
Conclusion
PCTs are useful in health services and pharmacy practice research because of their real-
world applicability. In our paper, we have presented an overview of the utility of PCTs in 
pharmacy practice research. Our recommendations and considerations for PCT designs are 
not exhaustive, however, and are meant to introduce these concepts to the health services and 
pharmacy practice research audience while providing additional resources to further guide 
PCT research.

General Differences between Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) and Pragmatic Clinical Trials (PCT)
Study Design Attribute PCT RCT
Who develops the study 
questions?Collaborative process between researchers/clinicians Researchers
What is the purpose? To improve intervention processes and inform clinical and 
policy decisionsTo determine treatment causes and effects
What question does it 
answer?Does the intervention work under usual conditions? Does the intervention work under ideal 
conditions?
Who is enrolled? Heterogeneous groups to accommodate real-world 
populationsGroups that meet explicit inclusion and 
exclusion criteria
What is studied? The effect of an intervention or treatment within and 
across a variety of institutional settings and heterogeneous 
populationsEffect of intervention or treatment on biological 
or biomarker outcomes in a more rigorously 
controlled environment
Adherence to Intervention Flexible, reflective of real-world practice Strictly enforced for continued study 
participation
Outcomes Directly relevant to the patients, providers, and other 
stakeholders involved in the study, collected within routine 
care processesMay be surrogates or other outcomes 
deliberately collected for the purpose of the 
study

Description, use, advantages, and disadvantages of different types of study design used in PCTs
Design Type Description Use Advantages Disadvantages
Parallel group Randomization of participants to one or more 
study arms, with each study arm allocated a 
different intervention ( Nair 2019 )Situations where experiments can be run 
simultaneously in a number of groups 
(Nair 2019 )Can be used to study many diseases 
(Nair 2019 )Contamination may occur if unplanned 
co-interventions or cross-overs occur 
(Nair 2019 )
Cross-over Participants serve as their own control, but 
are randomized to sequences of treatments 
(Greenberg 2015 )Where performance of control and 
intervention activities is required.Since each subject is its own control, 
a smaller sample size can be studied 
(Greenberg 2015 )Result validity may be affected if subjects 
drop-out before the second treatment 
period ( Greenberg 2015 )
Factorial (2 × 2) Evaluation of two interventions compared 
with a control within a single trial ( Greenberg 
2015 )Appropriate for:
Studying two or more interventions 
in various combinations in one study 
setting.
Studying the interactive effects resulting 
from combination of interventions ( Nair 
2019 )Can answer many research questions 
with a single trial and delivers more 
value when sample size is small ( Nair 
2019 )Trial complexity, including statistical 
analytical complexities, inability to 
combine two incompatible interventions, 
and complex protocols ( Nair 2019 )
Cluster 
randomizedRandomization of groups of subjects into 
treatment and control groups, as opposed to 
individual subjects ( Zabor et al 2020 )When practical issues make individual 
randomization difficult ( Cook et al 
2016 )Avoidance of contamination which 
occurs when aspects of an intervention 
are adopted by participants of the study 
who were randomized to not receive that 
intervention ( Minneci & Deans 2020 )Contamination may occur ( Cook et al 
2016 )
Equivalence 
(non-inferiority 
trials)Assessment of the equivalence of a new 
intervention to one that is already established 
(Greenberg 2015 )Useful where there are ethical issues 
associated with assigning patients to a 
placebo ( Hahn 2012 )Non-inferiority can be established with a 
much smaller sample than that required 
for superiority trials ( Hahn 2012 )Not useful where the control or standard 
therapy lacks established efficacy 
(Greenberg 2015 )
Adaptive Predefined design adaptations are made to 
trial procedures of ongoing clinical trials 
(Greenberg 2015 )To adjust different adaptations during 
the course of the trial as evidence 
accumulates ( Greenberg 2015 )Has the potential to accelerate 
therapeutic
development ( Greenberg 2015 )Can lead to unequal group sizes, which 
could affect statistical power negatively 
(Greenberg 2015 )
Stepped wedge Cross over (switching of treatments) of one 
or several clusters at different time points 
(called periods) and in a randomized manner, 
from the control treatment to the intervention 
treatment ( Ford & Norrie 2016 )Where there are ethical concerns about 
withholding a treatment from some of 
the participants ( Brown & Lilford 2006 )When the treatment cannot be started 
concurrently in all participants ( Nair 
2019 )Carry-over effects i.e., when the effects 
of the first treatment are not allowed to 
completely clear away before treatment 
is received for the next or second period 
(Copas et al 2015 )

Studies Where conducted Purpose Outcomes
Medication Adherence
(Choudhry et al 2018 )Multispecialty 
group practiceTo enhance medication adherence for patients 
suffering from chronic conditionsIncrease in adherence
Significant increase in patients achieving disease control
Non-significantly improved disease control for all eligible conditions
Evaluation study
(Carter et al 2018 )Private Family 
Medicine officesTo evaluate a centralized clinical pharmacy service Statistically significant improvement in the intervention group from 63.3% at baseline to 
67.8% at 12 months (p = 0.02) with an estimated benefit of the intervention of 5.0% ± 2.4% 
(95% CI = −0.5 to 10.4%, p=0.07)
Intervention study
(Margolis et al 2013 )Primary Care clinics a) To determine whether an intervention combining 
home blood pressure (BP) telemonitoring with 
pharmacist case management improves control 
compared with usual care b) To determine whether 
BP control is maintained after the intervention stopsAfter 6 months: BP was controlled in 71.8 % (95% CI, 65.6% – 77.3%) of Telemonitoring 
Intervention patients and 45.2% (95% CI, 39.2% – 51.3%) of Usual Care patients, P < 0.0001
At 12 months BP was controlled in 71.2% (95% CI, 62.0% – 78.9%) of Telemonitoring 
Intervention patients and 52.8% (95% CI, 45.4% – 60.2%) of Usual Care patients, P=0.005
Comparative study
(Margolis et al 2020 )Primary care clinics To inform health systems about the benefits, 
strengths, and limitations of implementing home 
BP telemonitoring with pharmacist managementControl of systolic BP to less than 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP to less than 90 mm Hg 
(<130/80 mm Hg in patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease) at 6 and 12 months. 
Secondary outcomes were change in BP, patient satisfaction, and BP control at 18 months
Medication safety
(Kane-Gill et al 2020)Nursing homes 
(NHs)a) To transform the medication regimen review 
process using telemedicine to prevent adverse drug 
events (ADEs)
b) To assess the impact of pharmacist-led and 
patient-centered telemedicine services in high-risk 
medication managementThe number of ADEs for NH 1 declined while that of NH 2 and NH 3 did not. In NH 1, the 
decline was attributed to an increase in the willingness by physicians to heed pharmacists’ 
recommendations. Also, when compared to usual care, there was a lower incidence of ADEs 
in the intervention group.
Implementation

remote, centralized cardiovascular risk service 
in organizational and culturally diverse medical 
centersBarriers to intervention implementation
