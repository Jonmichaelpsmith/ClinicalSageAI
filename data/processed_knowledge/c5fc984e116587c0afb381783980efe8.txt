Study Design:   This was a prospective, randomized, double masked, 12 -week, parallel group 
study  of latanoprost and timolol in pediatric subjects wi th glaucoma.  Approximately  
120subjects were planned to be enrolled.   
The Baseline visit was conducted 0 to 28 day s (4 weeks) after the Screening visit.  At the 
morning (before midday ) Baseline visit, a subject’s I OP had to be 22 mmHg in at least 
1eye.  To ensure that s ystemic exposure was not too high in this pediatric population, 
enrollment was staged b y age groups (0 to <3, 3 to <12, and 12 to 18 years old).  
Randomization was stratified by  age (0 to <3, 3 to <12, and 12 to 18 years old), diagnosis 
(2levels: primary  congenital glaucoma [PCG] or non -PCG) and IOP value of the study  eye 
(3levels: <27, 27 to 31, and >31 mmHg) at the Baseline visit.   Subjects were randoml y 
assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the 2 treatment groups (latanoprost or timolol) .
Following randomization, follow -up visits occurred at Weeks 1, 4 ,and 12.  If during the 
study  the Investiga tor determined that the IOP was not controlled (eg, IOP ≥36mmHg), 
therap y could be switched to open -label concomitant therap y of latanoprost 0.005% at 
approximately  8PM ( 30 minutes) and timolol 0.5% (or optionally  0.25% for subjects 
younger than 3 y ears old) twice daily at approximately 8 AM ( 30 minutes) and 8 PM 
(30minutes). If the therapy  was changed to t he concomitant therap y at Weeks 1 or 4, the 
subject was asked to return to the clinic for a visit at Week 2or 5 respectively .  If at Week 2 
or 5 IOP was not adequately  controlled (eg,IOP ≥36 mmHg), the subject was discontinued .  
The IOP measurements for all follow -up visits occu rredat 10 AM (1.5hours ).  
The schedule of activities is presented in Table 1.

latanoprost was dosed once dail y(double dumm y).  
Within each stratum subjects were randoml y assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the 2 treatment 
groups (latanoprost or timolol): Group 1 received latanop rost vehicle at approximately  8AM 
(30minutes) and latanop rost0.005% at approximately  8PM (30minutes), and Group 2 
received timolol 0.5% (or optionally  0.25% for subjects y ounger than 3 years old) twice dail y 
at approximately  8AM (30minutes) and 8 PM (30minutes).  Parents or legal guardians 
(primary  caretaker) of subjects administered 1 drop of stud y medication in each ey e once 
daily  in the morning and once dail y in the evening for the 84 day treatment duration 
(administration was to occur at consistent times throughout the stud y).  
Efficac y Endpoints :
Primary  Endpoint : 
Mean change from baseli ne IOP in the study  eye at Week 12.  
Secondary  Endpoint s: 
Mean IOP change from baseline in the study  at each visit (Week 1, Week 4, Week 12and 
Weeks 2 or 5 when applicable) .  
Mean IOP level in the study  eye at each visit (Baseline, Week 1, Week 4, Week 12and 
Weeks 2 or 5 when applicable) .  
Proportion of subject s with at least a 15% IOP reduction from baseline in the study  eye 
(for responder anal ysis).  
Proportion of subjects discontinuing therap y due to a drug-related adverse experience .  
Safety Evaluat ions:   Safety  evaluations included assessment of adverse events (AEs), visual 
acuity  and refraction, conjunctival hy peremia, pachy metry , pupil diameter, corneal diameter, 
biomicroscopy  (anterior segment), gonioscopy , biomicroscop y posterior segment 
(ophtha lmoscopy ), visual field, vital signs measurements, and a measurement of alertness.  
Statistical Methods:   The intention to treat ( ITT)population wasdefined as all subject s who 
were randomized into the study  and received at least 1 dose of study  medicati on.  
The per protocol ( PP)population wasrestricted to subjects with no major protocol violations 
who received at least 1 week of study  medication and h ad at least Week 1 IOP measurements 
during the 12 -week treatment period .  
The prim ary efficacy  endpoi nt was the mean IOP change from baseline in the study  eye at 
Week 12.  For subjects who switched to open -label concomitant therapy  or discontinued 
study  prior to Week 12, their last IOP measurements prior to the switch or study  
discontinuation was used to impute the I OP value at Week 12 using the Last Observation 
Carried Forward (LOCF) method. This applied to both the PP and I TT populations.

Template version 1.0 Page 6For the primary  endpoint, an anal ysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment and 
baseline diagnosis as factor s and baseline IOP as a covariate was used to estimate the 
difference in IOP reduction at Week 12 between latanoprost and timolol.  The corresponding 
p-value and 95% CI of the mean difference were also calculated.   
Before the ANCOVA model was fitted for t he primary  efficacy  endpoint, a test for 
parallelism was performed to ensure the ANCOVA model without the interaction terms 
among treatment group, baseline diagnosis and baseline IOP was appropriate for the primary  
efficacy  data anal ysis.  Note: The result s indicated that a statistical model with heterogeneous 
regression slopes for different treatment groups within different diagnosis subgroups would 
be a better fit to the study data.
The primary  efficacy  analy sis population for determination of non -infer iority was based on 
the PP population and the primary efficacy analy sis population for determination of 
superiority was based on the ITT population.
Secondary  Endpoint Analy ses:
The same ANCOVA model with treatment and baseline diagnosis as factors and baseline 
IOP as a covariate was used to estimate the difference in IOP reduction at each visit between 
latanoprost and timolol.  The corresponding p -value and 95% CI of the mean difference was 
also calculated.   
If a subject’s IOP reduction in the study  eye was greater than or equal to a 15% reduction 
from baseline at both Weeks 4 and 12, then this subject was classified as a responder.  A 
subject with an IOP reduction in the study  eye less than 15% reduction was classified as a 
nonresponder.   
Subgroup Ana lyses:  All efficacy  anal yses were also performed for the PCG and non -PCG 
subgroups within the PP and ITT populations.   
For the subgroup anal yses within the baseline diagnosis groups (PCG and non -PCG ), the 
ANCOVA model had only  treatment as the factor and baseline IOP as a covariate.  For the 
responder anal ysis, a Pea rson’s chi -square test was used to evaluate the treatment difference.   
RESULTS
Subject Disposition and Demography: Subject disposition is summarized in Table 3.  All 
137of the subjects treated in this study  were evaluable for inclusion in the I TT population 
and the safety  population; 77% of the subjects assigned to study  treatment were included in 
the PP population.

Efficacy Results :  
The least -square s(LS) mean of IOP reduct ion was 7.2mmHg in the latanoprost treated 
group and 5.7 mmHg in the timolol group.  The LS mean difference was 1.5 mmHg in favor 
of latanoprost.  The lower bound of the 95% CI of the difference between the L S means was 
-0.81 mmHg, which was above the pre -specified non -inferiorit y margin of -3 mmHg
demonstrating the noninferiority  of latanoprost to timolol.  The L S mean difference 
(1.5mmHg in favor of latanoprost) was also similar to the arithmetic mean difference 
(1.3mmHg in favor of latanoprost).   Resu lts from this primary  efficacy  endpoint analy sis are 
presented in Table 6for the study  eye in the PP population .

Deaths : Ther ewere nodeaths during the study .  
Most subjects had normal conjunctival hyperemia scores in the study  eye at baseline and in 
most cases scores were unchanged from baseline .  No clinically  meaningful changes from 
baseline results were noted for other safet y parameters including visual acuity ,central 
corneal thickness levels , pupil diameter, c orneal diameter, visual field testing, biomicroscopy  
(anterior segment), angle gradings measured via gonioscopy , aqueous flare, cells in the 
anterior chamber, or ophthalmoscopy  (posterior segment), vital signs, or alertness scores.  
CONCLUSION S:  In this prospective , randomized, double -masked, 12 -week, parallel -group 
study  of latanoprost and timolol in pediatric subjects with glaucoma 18years old:
Latanoprost 0.005% ophthalmic solution dosed once dail y was not inferior (within a 
noninferiority  margin of 3mmHg in IOP measurement) totimolol 0.5% (or optionally  
0.25% for subjects younger than 3 years old) dosed twice dail y.  
There was no statistically significant differen ce in t he proportion of subjects with a 15% 
or more IOP reduction at both Weeks 4 and 12 (responders) ; response rates in the 
latanoprost and timolol groups in the PP population were 60% and 52%, respectivel y, 
with a p -value of 0.33. 
Latanoprost demonstrated IOP reduction in both the PCG and non -PCG subgroups.  
When comparing the proporti on of responders between the treatment groups the response 
rates in the PCG subgroup were 50% in the latanoprost group and 46 %in the timolol
group; in the non -PCG subgroup the response rate swere72% and 5 7%, respectively .  
Latanoprost 0.005% ophthalmic solution was well -tolerated and the safet y profile was 
favorable.
