Abstract  
Clinical study reports (CSR) are detailed  
documents that provide a comprehensive and  
transparent account of the conduct and  
results of a clinical trial. They are an important  
source of information for the regulatory  
authorities, healthcare professionals, and the  
public, and are used to assess the safety and  
efficacy of medical treatments. This article  
presents an overview of the steps involved in  
writing and submitting CSRs to regulatory  
authorities, as well as reporting clinical trial  
findings to the scientific community and the  
public.  
 
 
nhe clinical study report (CSR) is a  
document that describes the results of a  
clinical trial and is used to assess the safety and  
effectiveness of a new medical treatment.1-3 CSRs  
provide detailed information about the design,  
conduct, and results of clinical studies.  
A CSR is prepared by the sponsor of the clinical  
trial to report study outcomes to regulatory  
authorities, such as the FDA in the US or the  
EMA in the EU. Regulatory authorities use the  
information in the CSR to evaluate the safety,  
efficacy, and quality of the medicinal product and  
to determine whether it should be approved for  
marketing. Information provided in the CSR is  
also used by researche rs and other stakeholders  
including patients and the public to evaluate the  
safety and efficacy of the treatment being tested  
and to make decisions about its potential use in  
clinical practice.  
 Types of CSRs  
Different types of CSRs can be prepared  
depending on the specific context and purpose  
of the clinical trial, as well as the requirements of  
the regulatory authority reviewing the data.  
 
Examples include:  
lFull CSR:  The most comprehensive type of  
CSR. It includes all the data and analyses  
from the clinical trial. Full CSRs are typically  
used for regulatory purposes, such as  
submitting data to the FDA in support of a  
new drug application.  
lInterim CSR: Used to report on the progress  
of a clinical trial that is still ongoing. Interim  
CSRs are typically shorter than full CSRs, are  written once the primary and secondary  
endpoints are met and may be used for  
marketing authorisation application (MAA)  
before the clinical trial is complete. Data on  
the exploratory endpoints and long-term  
follow-up are included later in the full CSR.  
lAbbreviated CSR:4, 5 Used for studies that do  
not contribute to the evaluation of efficacy or  
provide definitive information on the clinical  
pharmacology of the investigational product.  
Abbreviated CSRs contain abbreviated  
method and efficacy sections, as well as a  
detailed safety section.  
lSynoptic CSR:4 Generally prepared for  
studies that are not relevant in evaluating the  
effective ness and clinical pharmacology of the  Clinical study reports:

medicinal product but provide data for  
evaluating its safety (e.g. studies evaluating  
routes of drug administration for which  
marketing approval is not required, in com -
plete studies enrollin g fewer than one-third  
of intended participants, and early general  
phase 1 safety-tolerance studies).  
 
Structure of a CSR  
The content and format of a CSR are based on  
The International Council for Harmonisation  
of T echnical Requirements for Pharmaceutical s 
for Human Use guideline E3 on the Structure  
and Content of Clinical Study Reports (ICH  
E3),3 which was approved in 1996. The  
detailed structure of a CSR may vary slight ly 
depending on the specific requirements of the  
regulatory authority to which it is being  
submitted. Medical writers use the ICH E3  
template,3 the T ransCelerate template,6 and  
the CORE (Clarity and Openness in  
Reporting: E3-based) Refer ence to create  CSRs that are compliant with regulatory  
guidelines.7–10 
A CSR typically includes the following  
components:  
lSynopsis : A brief overview of the main find -
ings and con clusions of the study  
lIntroduction: Background in formation  
about the medicinal product  
being studied, including its  
intended use and the rationale  
for the study  
lMethods:  The study design, ob -
jectives and endpoints, patient  
population, interventions, and  
outcomes; includes informa tion  
about the ethical con siderations  
and any statistical analyses that  
were performed  
lResults:  The findings of the  
study, including both numeri cal  
data and descriptive infor mation;  
also includes tables, figures, and  other visual aids to illustrate the results  
lDiscussion:  The clinical implications of the  
study findings and limitations of the study  
lConclusion: The main find ings and con -
clusions of the study  
lAppendices:  Additional information or  
materials that are relevant to the study such as  
protocols, informed con sent  
forms, data tables, figures and  
listings, as well as patient  
narratives  
 
Submission of a CSR  
The submission process for  
CSRs differs depending on the  
regulatory authority. Under  
the Clinical T rials Regulation  
(EU) No 536/2014 (EU  
CTR), EU member states and  
European Economic Area  
(EEA) countries have, since  
January 31, 2022, been able to  
use the Clinical T rial Information System (CTIS)  
to submit all clinical trial data .11–13 The CTIS  
harmonises the submission, assessment, and  
supervision pro cesses for clinical trials; A single  
application can be submitted through the CTIS  
for review by all EU/EEA countries. The CTIS  
also facilitates interactions between clinical trial  
sponsors and the regulatory authorities in  
EU/EEA countries throughout the clinical trial,  
and replaced the EU Drug Regulating  
Authorities Clinical T rials Database (EudraCT)  
on January 31, 2023.14,15 The CTIS will store all  
documents related to clinical trials (e.g. CSRs  
and clinical study protocols) and will also serve  
as a publicly accessible database for clinical trial  
data. However, the CTIS does not accept or  
evaluate MAAs for the commercialisation of  
medicinal products, which must be made  
separately.  
As per Article 37 of the EU CTR, sponsors  
who have had their MAAs approved are required  
to submit a full CSR to the CTIS within 30 days  
after the marketing authorisation approval.9,16  
Article 37(4) also requires the sponsor to submit  
a summary of the clinical trial results to the  
CTIS, irrespective of the outcome of the clinical  
trial, within one year from the end of the trial in  
adults (6 months for a clinical trial in the  
paediatric population), in all the EU languages  
in which the study was conducted.9,17 Sponsors  
are required to provide a summary of results and  
a lay summary after the end of each clinical trial  
in the EU. The CSR, summary of clinical trial  
The detailed  
structure of a CSR  
may vary slightly  
depending on the  
specific  
requirements of  
the regulatory  
authority to which  
it is being  
submitted.

results, and the lay summary are disclosed  
publicly. In the US, a full CSR is submitted as part  
of a New Drug Appli cation (NDA) to the FDA.18 
Unlike in the EU, CSRs in the US are not  
disclosed publicly.  
Sponsors in the EU are required to submit all  
CSRs that are intended to be used for marketing  
authorisations.19,20 As part of an MAA, CSRs are  
compiled in Module 5 of the common technical  
document (CTD), a standardised  
format for submitting regulatory  
information to health authorities  
globally.21,22 The CTD consists of five  
modules that cover different aspects  
of the submission (e.g. quality, safety,  
and efficacy of the product), and  
includes a comprehensive overview of  
the clinical trials and their results.  
 
Reporting findings published in CSRs  
Findings reported in CSRs are disseminated in  
several ways.  l    European Public Assess ment Reports:23 
Reports prepared by the EMA and published  
on the EMA website. These reports provide  
information on the medicinal product,  
including the evaluation process and the  
decision to approve or reject the MAA  
l    Clinical trial registries:  The EudraCT or  
CTIS databases of the EMA, the Inter national  
Clinical T rials Registry Platform of the  
WHO,24 and the ClinicalT rials.gov  
registry25 in the US  
l    Other public disclosure plat -
forms:  EMA clinical data website  
under EMA Policy 0070,26 Health  
Canada Public Release of Clinical

l    Lay language summaries:  Pub -
lished in the CTIS or on company  
websites  
lPublications: Manuscripts  in peer-reviewed  
journals, conference posters and presen ta -
tions, abstracts, preprints, and plain-language  summaries. Good Publication Practice guide -
lines28–30 mandate that all biomedical research  
should be published in peer-reviewed journals  
in a timely manner and that reporting of  
biomedical research should follow all ap -
plicable laws and guidelines. Several checklists  
exist to ensure that findings from a CSR are  
reported accurately and transparently in peer-
reviewed medical journals.31 Examples include:  
l   CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of  
Reporting Trials):32 A guideline for  
reporting randomised,  controlled trials  
l   STROBE (STrengthening the Reporting  
of OBservational studies in Epidemi ol o -
gy):33 A guideline for reporting obser -
vational studies  
lProduct information:  Clinical trial results are  
also reported in the summary of product  
characteristics or prescribing information (a  
document prepared for healthcare  
professionals), as well as package leaflets  
(aimed at the patient).

Writing your first CSR  
Medical writers specialising in regulatory  
documents typically spend a lot of time writing  
CSRs. A medical writer working on a CSR needs  
to have sound knowledge of how clinical trials are  
planned, conducted, and reported.34–39 For an  
aspiring medical writer, there are several online  
training programs and courses on how to write a  
CSR (T able 1). Writing a CSR is a team effort  
involving multiple stakeholders including  
clinicians, biostatisticians, regulatory specialists,  
safety experts, and the clinical study management  
team. Therefore, the medical writer also needs  
strong communication and project management  
skills. Planning timelines and determining  
stakeholder roles before the start of the project  
can help with effective project management. CSR  
templates based on the ICH E3 guideline,  
T ransCelerate template, and CORE Reference  
can help the medical writer create a document  
that meets rigorous regulatory standards.
