2 Introduction  
2.1 LMN -0801 With in the Current Therapeutic Landscape for Obesity  
Obesity is a silent pan demic  whose  sequelae includ e diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidaemia , 
heart disease, stroke, sleep a pnoea, and the associated morbidity and mortality (NCD Risk Factor 
Collaboration 2016) . There is an urgent need for effective and safe weight loss interventions  that are 
more affordable and scalable  than current options . 
In addition to lifestyle  and surgical interventions, several drugs  are now available for weight loss.  
Incretin  analogue  drugs—especially glucagon -like peptide -1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist s—have generated 
remarkable results . By stimulating insulin secretion and inhibiting glucagon secretion in response to food 
intake, GLP -1 regulates postprandial glucose excursions. GLP -1 also stimulates centrally  mediated 
appetite control and satiety  (van Bloemendaal et al., 2014) . Next -generation dual agonists like 
tirzep atide (Eli Lilly & Co.) generate even greater weight  loss.  Incretin analogues appear to be saf e 
enough for mass -market use  (in contrast to the older, small -molecule weight  loss drugs like fen -phen 
and rimonabant ). 
However, significant challenges r emain. GLP -1 analogues are costl y, with limited insurance coverage in 
most regions, which blocks access for most  individuals with obesity . At least one oral formulation 
(Rybelsus, Novo Nordisk) has been approved , but most are administered by injection . The U.S. Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention  estimates  that needle fear affects up to 25% of adult s (Wolicki ; 
Miller 2023) , which further limits ac cess. For those who can access  GLP-1 analogues , significant side 
effects such as nausea and  diarrhoea  lead ~50% of patients to abandon the drugs within a year . 
Rebounding with r apid weight gain can  follow treatment cessation for all incretin analogues . 
More importantly , incretin -analogue developers have encountered profound scaling challenges, to the 
extent that they have found it necessary to delay launches in second -tier geographies ( e.g., Europe)  
(Fick; Skydsgaard 2023; Müller et al. 2012)  and ration supplies  (Burger; Matthews 2023) . The need for 
injection -grade sterility and cold -chain distribution drive s up costs and limit s access for less affluent 
patients, particularly those living outside the U.S. and Europe.  The production bottleneck  guarantee s 
high prices for the foreseeable future, but it also means that most cannot get  access at any price.  
With LMN -0801 , Lumen  Bioscience aims  to fill these gaps. LMN -0801  is an orally consumed  monoclonal 
protein  therapeutic —a leptin  analogue —produced and delivered with in the biomass of the common 
food algae, spirulina  (Jester et al. 2022) . Developed initially with funding support from the Bill & Melinda 
Gates Foundation  for global health applications , Lumen’s  unique GMP  biomanufacturing platform  
enables  recombinant protein therapeutics for oral delivery at massive scale and very low  cost per 
dose —inexpensive  enough even for low-income , developi ng-world  applications  (Finrow 2021) . In short, 
the unique approach promises to solve the scaling and cost challenges that hold back broader adoption 
of biologic drugs for obesity  and weight loss . 
2.2 Background on Leptin  
Leptin was one of the first identified satiety -inducing hormones. It is constitutively synthesised  by 
adipose tissues and acutely by gastric epithelial cells in response to food intake. Leptin has been studied 
in dozens of clinical trials dating to 199 7 (Farooqi and O’Rahilly  2014) . A parenterally delivered leptin 
analogue ( Myalept ; Chiesi  Farmaceutici S.p.A. ) was approved by the U.S. FDA in 2014  for lipodystrophy  
  Version 1.0, February 6, 2025  
Lumen Bioscience, Inc. ©  CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY  Page  5 
(U.S. Food and Drug Administration 2014) . LMN -0801 is intended for oral administration,  but it is 
reassuring that even parenteral ly delivered  leptin analogues have generally been found to be safe and 
well tolerated in human clinical trials .  
Although systemic leptin is well known to control food intake in lean animals and humans, obese 
individuals (including diet-induced obese ( DIO) rodent models) are resistant to systemic leptin. In human 
trials, injection site reactions with the parenteral formulation were dose -limiting  (Heymsfield et al. 
1999) . These headwinds, and the high cost of manufacturing protein therapeutics for parenteral 
delivery, resulted in the eventual abandonment of leptin for all but a handful extremely rare diseases 
(lipodystrophy and congenital leptin deficiency).  
Remarkably, Lumen discovered that orally delivered leptin significantly suppresses hunger in the DIO 
mouse model. Thus, oral delivery of biologic drugs can exploit hunger -modulating circuits in the 
gastrointestinal ( GI) tract  that are functionally inaccessible to the same biologics delivered parenterally . 
Importantly, leptin receptors are present on the luminal side of intestinal epithelial cells and on vagal 
afferent neurons that innervate the GI tract and project to the central nervous system . Lumen has 
shown that oral spirulina -leptin reduces food intake and induces significant weight loss in DIO rodents. 
Notably, bioencapsulation within spirulina is required for the bioactivity of oral leptin (and likely the 
other candidates) to prevent degradation during gastric transit.  
The leptin analogue within LMN -0801 is thought to operate by modulating endocrine system receptor 
targets directly with in GI tissues . Preclinical  studies by Lumen and unaffiliated labs have also found 
therapeutic synergies in animal models of obesity with concomitant dosing of leptin with other anti -
obesity therapeutic peptides , including GLP -1 analogues  (Müller et al. 2012)  (Figure  1) and amylin  (Roth 
et al. 2008) . The latter finding with amylin replicated in a Phase  2 clinical trial , which demonstrated that 
dosing parenteral leptin with amylin deepened weight loss compared with  amylin monotherapy  (Roth et 
al. 2008) . Parenteral leptin monotherapy has also been shown to sustain weight loss  in mice  after 
withdrawal of GLP -1 analogue  treatment  (Müller et al. 2012) .  
2.3 Potential Therapeutic Uses for LMN -0801  
Preclinical  data developed by Lumen and its collaborators indicate s that a spirulina -expressed , orally 
delivered  leptin analogu e—LMN -0801 —may be effective as a monotherapy weight loss agent.   
In addition to superior affordability and convenience, t here may also be significant tolerability 
advantages over systemically dosed incretin 
analogues. At approximately 16 kilodaltons (kDa), 
the protein is far larger than the two kDa size 
typically cited as the upper limit for intact 
absorption, and systemic absorption has not been 
observed in vivo . Preferential activation of leptin 
receptors in GI tissues likely explains the 
differential therapeutic outcomes in animal 
models compared with  parenteral deli very. It also 
enhances the expected safety profile of the 
product , as leptin therapy (even when injected) 
does not appear to carry the same GI side 
effects —nausea, emesis, and diarrhoea —that 
Figure 1:  Therapeutic synergies of parenteral pegylated leptin 
(PEG G111) with the GLP -1 analogue exendin -4. Leptin dosed 
concomitantly with a GLP -1 analogue deepens weight loss 
compared with GLP -1 monotherapy, and parenteral leptin can 
maintain weight loss as a monotherapy (Müller et al., 2012 ).

accompany  GLP-1 analogue  therapy . Lower cost, easier administration (oral), and presumed superior 
tolerability may make it an important addition to the physician’s  tools for treating obesity.  
These unique features may also facilitate  other therapeutic modalities  (Figure  1). If the therapeutic 
synergies demonstrated in in vivo  studies replicate in humans, LMN -0801 may have utility dosed in 
combination with GLP -1 analogues,  permitting dose titration of GLP-1 analogues below levels associated 
with deleterious  side effects. LMN -0801 may also have utility as a maintenance therapy , helping  
individuals with obesity maintain the weight loss induced with GLP -1 analogues after they can no longer 
tolerate the injections and side effects, at lower cost and greater convenience.  
The study proposed here aims to generate data to inform future development of LMN -0801 across these 
varied potential use cases.  
2.4 Summary Risk/Benefit Assessment  
LMN -0801 brings together three streams of research , each with decades of clinical safety data: spirulina 
consumed as a food, oral protein  therapeutics , and parenterally delivered leptin and leptin analogues . 
Taken together, these lengthy safety records indicate that there is minimal risk associated with orally 
ingesting LMN -0801. 
Spirulina , the common food algae within whose biomass the leptin analogue is grown and orally 
delivered , has a well -established and documented tolerability and safety profile  from its multi -hundred -
year history of use as a food source for humans and animals, and it has been involved in numerous 
clinical trials with no reports of adverse events  (AEs). Possible non -serious AEs have been reported with 
spirulina intended as a nutritional supplement. The FDA MedWatch from January 2001 to July 2009 
reported that the most common  putative side effects from spirulina consumption are nausea,  diarrhoea , 
vomiting, fatigue, headache, dizziness, itching, rash, and abdominal cramps. These reports lacked 
information on the quantity, duration, individual history, or quality of spirulina used and were based on 
food -grade spirulina grown in uncontrolled, outdoo r ponds exposed to wildlife and environmental 
contaminants (Marles et al. 2011) . Given its well -established and documented tolerability and safety 
profile, t he FDA’s  Office of Food Additive Safety has issued “no further questions ” responses to 
numerous Generally Recognised  as Safe (GRAS) notification submissions for spirulina -based food 
products. It has been sold at a mass -market scale in the U.S. since the 1970s.  
Orally delivered protein therapeutics  also have a long track record of safe clinical trials. Like the leptin 
analogue expressed within LMN -0801, orally delivered protein  therapeutics have been shown to be  too 
large for systemic absorption through the gut lining. As a result, the risk of off -target toxicity in humans 
is low, an observation that is borne out in clinical trial data. The U.S. FDA has reviewed many human 
clinical trials  using orally delivered protein therapeutics of various classes, including polyclonal (van 
Dissel et al. 2005; Mattila et al. 2008; Numan et al. 2007)  and recombinant antibodies  (Jester et al. 2022)  
and enzymes like lysozyme, a broad -spectrum bacteriolytic enzyme approved for oral administration in 
several countries  (Hashida et al., 2002 ). Such studies nearly universally report robust safety and 
tolerability and no treatment -related adverse effects.  
Lumen itself has completed clinical trials with seven spirulina -expressed, monoclonal protein 
therapeutics delivered orally (NCT04098263, NCT04182490, NCT04893239) and intranasally 
(NCT06030414). A large , multicentre  trial was recently initiated in the U.S. to assess four orally 
delivered, spirulina -expressed protein therapeutics (three antibodies and one endolysin enzyme) for 
  Version 1.0, February 6, 2025

prevention of Clostridioides difficile  infection  (NCT05330182). To date, s ystemic absorption of spirulina -
expressed therapeutic protein s has not been detected. Likewise, no treatment -related AEs—or serious  
AEs of any kind —have been reported in any of these trials . 
Leptin analogues  have been studied almost exclusively through parenteral delivery , often in individuals 
suffering from obesity, congen ital leptin deficiency, and acute lipodystrophy  (Araújo -Vilar and Santini 
2019; Oral et al. 2002; Rodriguez  et al.  2015) . Although generally reported  to be safe and well tolerated  
in clinical trials , inject ed leptin analogues have been  found to elicit antibody responses  (Chan et al. 
2016) . This raise d a concern that anti -leptin antibodies potentially could impair metabolic control and 
immune function, though  clinical evidence for this conjecture is not clear . The U.S. FDA approved 
metreleptin injection in 2014 , subject to a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy  (REMS) program 
requirement . In larger studies of obese individuals treated with metreleptin , these antibodies were 
rarely found to be neutralising  (FDA 2014) . Given the tolerogenic nature of the GI tract to exogenous 
proteins, o ral administration is expected to mitigate these risks further . Systemic absorption has not 
been observed in in vivo  studies . There is one published announcement  of clinical trial result with orally 
administ ered  leptin  (Yaari, Estee 2020) , which reported  positive results in safety, tolerability, and 
preliminary efficacy.  
In sum, given the lengthy safety record of each  research stream —spirulina biomass, orally delivered 
protein therapeutics, and leptin analogues —culminating in the creation of LMN -0801 , it is expected to 
have a robust safety profile , justifying its exploratory use in the proposed clin ical trials .

The secondary objective aims to assess LMN -0801’s  efficacy in promoting weight loss. The endpoints 
measure changes in body weight and body fat percentage from baseline to Week 24, offering 
quantitative data on the drug’s  efficacy . These metrics will help determine if LMN -0801 produces 
clinically significant weight loss and improvements in body composition in adults  with obesity , which is 
crucial for establishing its potential as a therapeutic option.   
AEs will also be monitored after cessation of treatment.

These exploratory objective s delve deeper into understanding how LMN -0801 affects body weight and 
composition over time. The endpoints track changes in weight,  fat mass, lean mass , BMI, waist 
circumference, and lean -fat ratio at various time points, providing insights into LMN -0801’s  impact on 
body weight and composition . This detailed analysis will help elucidate the drug’s  mechanism of action 
and its effects on overall body composition.  
This objective aims to evaluate weight changes during treatment and after cessation, which is important 
for understanding the drug’s  long er-term effects and potential rebound effects. The endpoints measure 
weight changes at Day 28, Week 12, Week 24, and Week 29, allowing for the assessment of the drug’s  
efficacy over time and potentially identifying any plateau effects or weight regain after treatment stops.  
Changes in weight would be expected to be accompanied by changes in blood pressure and pulse.

4 Study Design  
4.1 General Study Design  
The study aims to assess LMN -0801  across dose levels  (low, medium, high ), frequenc y of dosing  (QD, 
BID, TID ), and oral capsule  formulations  (see the Investigator’s  Brochure for formulation details ). The 
design of experiments methodology is the most efficient way to generate statistically reliable data with 
the fewest study participants . This approach aligns with the U.S. FDA’s  model -informed drug 
development initiative (MIDD ). The primary goals of the FDA’s  MIDD program are to leverage new er 
statistical methods to “accelerate the development of new medical products and enable more informed 
decision -making ” (Madabushi et al. 2022) . 
Participants will be randomised to one of  ten different cohorts with 12-18 participants in each cohort ( as 
indicated in Table  1), treated for 24 weeks, and then followed an additional four weeks. Stratification 
factors are BMI (<35 and >35 kg/m2) and biological sex (male or female).  
Table 1: Study Cohorts  
Cohort  N LMN -0801  Capsule Formulation , # 
  Dose † Frequency*  A§ B§ 
1 128 Placebo  **BID B0 0 
2 12 Low QD A0 3 
3 12 Low TIQD B3 0 
4 12 Medium Low BID C0 6 
5 12 Medium  TBID A3 3

7 12 High Medium  QTID C0 9 
8 12 High  BTID A3 6 
9 12 High  QTID B6 3 
10 12 High  TID C9 0 
* Frequency: QD is once a day (morning meal); BID is twice a day (morning and evening meals);  
TID is three times a day (morning, lunch, dinner meals)  
** For placebo, four volunteers will receive QD, four will receive BID, four will receive TID  
† Low is 1200 mg; Medium is 2400 mg; High is 3600 mg  total daily dose of LMN -0801  
§ See Investigator’s Brochure for formulation details  
In this way, frequency of dosing and type of formulation are also varied such that the combination of  
daily  dosing level , frequency of dosing, and formulation is constructed orthogonally , which  enables 
reliable estimation of the main effects of each formulation and construction of modelling  of the 
predicted two -way interaction effects between dosing level , capsule type,  and frequency of dosing . The 
specific statistical design of experiments approach is a simplex lattice mixture design in three factors  
(Cornell 2002) . Mixture experiments are widely used today in formulation experiments, blending 
experiments, and marketing choice experiments  (Hare, Altan, and Coppenolle 2025) definitive screening 
design , a fractional factorial design that is balanced and orthogonal in factors. Notably, all combinations  
. In this context, a t each daily dosing amount , practical mixtures  of LMN -0801 dose levels uncoated and 
coated capsules  are tested in a full factorial fashion . to determine the optimal weight -loss blend at a 
given  dose intensity.

enrolment , treatment , and follow -up study visits.  In preparation for each study visit, participants will be 
asked to fast overnight.  
6.1 Recruitment and Screening  
Healthy , adult individuals with obesity  will be recruited by the principal investigator (PI) and study team 
using advertising approved by the Human Research Ethics C ommittee (HREC ) as required under 
Australia n law . Volunteers who express interest in participating in the study will be asked to complete a 
pre-screen questionnaire (Appendix  1) to assess general health status and basic eligibility , including 
informed consent to the screening procedures . Potential participants meeting basic eligibility 
requirements will be scheduled for an in -person screening not more than 28 days prior to planned 
enrolment . 
At the in -person screening visit, potential participants’  height and weight will be measured , and they  will 
be carefully screened. This will include collecting demographic information, obtaining a health history 
with current medications, and conducting a physical exam  with height, weight, BMI, and vital signs 
measurements , urine pregnancy testing ( for females of childbearing potential), and a blood draw for 
laboratory analyses (safety labs).  Data for screen failure reason, eligibility criteria, and demograp hy will 
be captured on the appropriate screening and enrolment log. At the discretion of the PI, assessments 
may be repeated if abnormal values were recorded in the first instance. Values outside the ranges 
specified in the criteria below may be considered  acceptable if determined by the PI (in conjunction with 
the independent medical monitor) as not clinically significant.  
Details of the protocol and necessary time commitment will be discussed. If willing and able to 
participate in all study activities and visits and to provide written informed consent, eligible volunteers 
will be invited to enrol .  
Individuals not meeting eligibility criteria will be informed of their ineligibility and will not be invited to 
return to the clinical for enrolment  and other study Day  0activities 0 activities .

Lumen Bioscience, Inc. ©  CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY  Page  13 
6.2 Randomisation  and Enrolment  
On study Day 0, participants will come to the clinic for enrolment .  
The following procedures will take place on Day 0: 
• Adverse events  
• Concomitant medications   
• Physical exam ination  
• Vital Signs (systolic and diastolic  blood pressure, pulse rate, oral temperature, respiration rate)   
• Weight and BMI  
• Waist circumference  
• Body composition measurements  (including  lean mass, fat mass and bone density ) by DEXA scan  
• Urine pregnancy testing (for females of childbearing potential)  
• Blood collected for clinical safety lab s 
• Serum collected for study drug detection and anti -drug antib odies  
• Serum collected for  HbA1c  and TSH 
• Serum collected  for cardiometabolic biomarkers (including  ghrelin, GLP -1 and glucagon)  
Additionally, diet, nutrition, and lifestyle counselling , including advice on exercise, will be provided to 
each participant.  
Following this baseline assessment and counselling , each eligible participant will be randomised  in a 
double -blind fashion to one of ten cohort groups ( see Table  1 above ) and receive an initial oral dose of 
LMN -0801 or placebo. As noted above , randomised  enrolment  will be biased to first fill groups 1 
(placebo), 8, 9, and 10. Eligible participants will be considered enrolled only once they receive directly  
observed , orally administered study drug at the enrolment  visit. If they do not receive study drug for any 
reason, they will not be considered enrolled.  
After receiving the first dose of study drugs, each participant will be monitored for two hours to assess 
for tolerability. At the end of two hours, vital signs and any AEs will be recorded. If necessary, 
participants will be monitored for an additional two to four  hours for resolution of AEs. 
On departure, e ach participant will  receive : 
• a supply of  study drugs to administer at home until the Week  4 study visit ; and  
• study drug self -administration instructions and adherence counselling ; and  
• an electronic WiFi -enabled scale with an induction -based body composition measurement feature 
for weekly  weight and at-home body composition measurements ; and  
• weekly and daily questionnaires  for the participants to complete at home  
6.3 Treatment  Phase  
During the 24-week treatment  phase, participants will take their assigned study drugs orally as directed . 
A daily questionnaire will be administered with questions on study drug adherence.  
A weekly questionnaire will be administered with questions about occurrence of  AEs, and concomitant 
medications.  Participants will be asked to record their weight , lean mass and  fat mass  weekly using the 
provided WiFi -enabled scale.  
  Version 1.0, February 6, 2025  
Lumen Bioscience, Inc. ©  CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY  Page  14 
Participants also will come to the clinic during  Week 1 (Day 7), Week 4 (Day 28) , Week 8 (Day 56), Week 
12 (Day 84) , Week 18 (Day 126), Week 24 (Day 168), and Week 2 9 (Day  203) for study visits . In 
preparation for each study visit, participants will be asked to fast overnight (at least 8 hours) the night 
before and to bring their remaining study drug  for counting . To balance endpoint precision against 
scheduling practicalities, these visits will be set within the scheduling windows noted in the schedule of 
activities (Table  1). 
At the indicated study  visits, participants  will have their weight , BMI, waist  circumference, body 
composition  by DEXA scan , and vital signs measured . They will also  have labs drawn . In addition to 
collecting and performing a pill count of their previous study drug supply, a new  supply of study drugs  
will be provided  to the participants to self-administer at home until their next study visit . Site staff will 
review the questionnaires at each study  visit.  
6.4 Follow -Up Phase ; Study Completion  
The treatment phase ends at Week 24, at which time  participants will be asked to bring their remaining 
study drugs to the clinic  and fast overnight the night before . At this study visit,  in addition to collecting 
and performing a pill count of their study drug supply , participants  will have their weight, BMI, waist  
circumference, hip circumference, body composition  by DEXA scan , and vital signs measured . They will 
also have labs drawn.   
During the four -week  follow -up phase, participants will not take study drugs but will continue to take  at-
home  week ly weights and body composition measurements and to complete the same weekly 
questionnaire.   
A final study visit will occur at Week 29, again following a fast the night before. At this final study visit, 
participants  will have their weight, BMI, waist  circumference, hip circumference,  body composition  by 
DEXA scan , and vital signs measured,  and labs drawn.  
6.5 Concomi tant Medications  
Concomitant medication use will be documented  at each study visit . 
6.6 Early Termination  
Participants may discontinue from the study prematurely for several reasons:  
6.6.1 Participant Decision to Discontinue Study Drug  
If a participant decides to stop taking the study drug, they will be offered the opportunity to continue all 
other study activities through the end of the five-week follow -up period. The date of last dose should be 
recorded, and the reason for discontinuation should be documented in the participant’s  medical record 
and case report form ( CRF). 
6.6.2 Withdrawal of Informed Consent  
Participants may choose to withdraw their informed consent at any time during the study. In this case, 
no further study procedures or follow -up will be conducted. The date of withdrawal and reason should 
be documented in the participant’s  medical record and CRF.  
  Version 1.0, February 6, 2025  
Lumen Bioscience, Inc. ©  CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY  Page  15 
6.6.3 Principal Investigator Decision  
The Principal Investigator may decide to discontinue a participant from the study drug if it is deemed to 
be in the best interest of the participant. In such cases, participants will be offered the opportunity to 
continue all other study activities through  the end of the five-week follow -up period. The date of last 
dose, reason for discontinuation, and justification should be documented in the participant’s  medical 
record and CRF.  
For all types of early termination, the following procedures should be followed:  
• Schedule an early termination visit as soon as possible after the decision to discontinue ; 
• Conduct all assessments scheduled for the final study visit, if possible ; 
• Record any adverse events and concomitant medications ; 
• Retrieve all unused study drug ; and  
• Encourage participants to complete follow -up safety assessments when applicable . 
Data collected up to the point of withdrawal will be retained and included in the study analyses, unless 
the participant specifically requests otherwise.  
The study team will make reasonable efforts to contact participants who are lost to follow -up to 
determine their status and reason for discontinuation.  
All early terminations will be reported to the human research e thics committee ( HREC) in accordance 
with local requirements  at the contact information provided in Section  9.4. 
Participant s who withdraw from the study prior to their first study drug administration  will be replaced 
per recruitment , screening,  and enrolment  processes outlined in  Section  6.1. 
7 Study Evaluations and Measurements  
7.1 Weight  and Body Composition Measure ment s 
At enrolment , participants  will be supplied with a WiFi -enabled scale for at-home  use during the study , 
which will include induction -based measurement of body composition.  
Weight , BMI, and waist circumference,  , will also be taken at each clinic study visit for comparison and 
validation purposes.  In addition, Dual -Energy X -ray Absorptiometry ( DEXA) scans will be conducted  at 
Study Day 0, Week 12, Week 24, and Week 29 . DEXA scans use low -dose X -rays to measure bone 
density, lean mass, and fat mass and are commonly found in many clinics.  
7.2 Laboratory  
7.2.1 Safety labs  
For the purposes of this study, safety labs will include serum chemistry and haematology . Participants 
will be asked to fast for at least 8 hours prior to collection of safety labs. Serum chemistry consists of 
assays for sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, creatinine, albumin, aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) , alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, amylase, 
and lipid profile. Haematology will include  assays for haemoglobin , complete  blood cell count (with 
differ ential ), and platelet count .  Safety labs will be assessed,  and clinically significant results will be 
reported as adverse events.  
  Version 1.0, February 6, 2025  
Lumen Bioscience, Inc. ©  CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY  Page  16 
7.2.2 HbA1c  
The HbA1c assay measures the percentage of haemoglobin  molecules in the blood that have glucose 
attached to them. This test provides an average measure of blood glucose levels over the preceding two 
to three  months, the typical lifespan of red blood cells. In Australia , the common reporting unit is a 
percentage, with a normal range typically considered to be below 5.7%, prediabetes between 5.7 -6.4%, 
and diabetes at 6.5% or higher.  
In this study, HbA1c may provide insight into the participant’s  glucose metabolism and can indicate 
whether the weight loss drug affects blood sugar control. For participants who start with prediabetic 
HbA1c levels, the study can assess whether the drug improves their glycaemic  status. The drug’s  effect 
on HbA1c might differ between participants with normal baseline values and those with elevated levels, 
allowing for subgroup analyses. Unexpected increases in HbA1c could signal adverse effects on glucose 
metabolism, which is crucial for safety assessment.  
By including HbA1c measurements, this study can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the 
drug’s  effects on overall metabolic health, beyond just weight loss. This data may be valuable for 
assessing the drug’s  potential benefits, safety profile, and possible indications for use.  
7.2.3 Thyroid -stimulating hormone  
The thyroid -stimulating hormone ( TSH) assay is a blood test that measures the level of thyroid 
stimulating hormone in the blood. TSH is produced by the pituitary gland and regulates the production 
of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland. Modern TSH assays are highly sensitive and can detect very 
low concentrations of TSH, allowing for accurate diagnosis of both hyper - and hypo -thyroidism. The 
normal range for TSH can vary slightly between laboratories, but it is it’s typically between 0.4 and 4.0 
mIU/L (milli -international units per litre) for adults.  
In this study, changes in TSH levels could indicate that the weight loss drug is affecting thyroid function, 
which is crucial for safety assessment. Significant alterations in TSH might suggest a need for further 
thyroid function tests. Monitoring TSH can help determine if the drug’s  weight loss effects are related to 
changes in thyroid function. TSH levels have been shown to correlate positively with leptin in many 
studies on both adults and children. TSH levels can provide insights into the drug’s  overall  effect on 
metabolism, complementing other metabolic markers like HbA1c.  
By including TSH measurements, the study may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the 
drug’s  effects on endocrine function and metabolism. This data will be valuable for assessing the drug’s  
safety profile, potential mechanisms of action, and possible indirect effects on thyroid function, which 
are closely linked to body weight and metabolism.  
7.2.4 Lipid Profile  
A lipid profile typically includes measurements of total cholesterol, low -density lipoprotein (LDL) 
cholesterol, high -density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides in the blood.  These components 
provide valuable information about an individual’s  cardiovascular health and risk for atherosclerosis.  The 
lipid profile is included in the safety labs.  
7.2.5 Pharmacokinetic and Biomarker Analyses  
Serum will be collected for potential detection of the presence of the leptin analogue in serum and 
determination of the presence of antibodies  against the leptin analogue . If anti -drug antibodies are 
confirmed, additional testing on the samples may be performed (e.g., titre  and neutralising  antibodies) 
  Version 1.0, February 6, 2025  
Lumen Bioscience, Inc. ©  CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY  Page  17 
to gain further understand ing. In addition, sera will be collected to determine levels of satiety and 
cardiometabolic biomarkers (examples include ghrelin, GLP -1, and glucagon). Expression evaluation will 
improve understanding of the relationship between oral formulation and dosing regimen on circulating 
obesity -related b iomarkers.  
8 Study  Product s 
8.1 Study  Product s Generally  
The study drug s, LMN -0801 and placebo , will be supplied by Lumen . LMN -0801 is comprised of a 
biomass of the common food algae spirulina  that has been engineered to intracellularly express a 
protein that is an analogue of the human gut hormone leptin.  
Prior Leptin analogues have been tested in over 65 clinical trials, nearly all of which evaluated  parenteral 
delivery. Lumen’s  recombinant leptin protein is expressed and delivered within the spirulina biomass for 
oral delivery . Preclinical  data suggest that gut -specific application of this orally administered spirulina -
leptin analogue may enhance its weight -loss potential and improve safety. For this study, doses of LMN -
0801 will be delivered as a spray -dried powder in capsule s without additional excipient s. 
Placebo will be identical -appearing cornstarch (NF) with colouring  in identical -looking capsules .  
No capsules  will contain any materials of human or animal origin.  
8.2 Dosing Regimen  
Participants  will orally self-administer  LMN -0801  or placebo capsules daily  as directed  (see Section  4.1). 
8.3 Timing of Doses  
The initial  study drug administration date and start and stop times must be recorded in the participant’s  
chart and in the case report form  (CRF).  
The preferred timing of LMN -801 or placebo capsule dosing is as follows:  
• Daily (QD) dosing : all capsules consumed  first thing in the morning  (before breakfast, if taken)  
• Twice -daily (BID) dosing : means midday morning  (before lunch, breakfast, if taken)  and evening  
(before dinner, if taken)  
• Thrice -daily (TID) dosing : first thing in the morning  (before breakfast , if taken) , midday  (before 
lunch, if taken) and evening  (before dinner, if taken)  
Each participant will be provided a  daily questionnaire  by the study  clinic to record study drug 
administration, date, time, and relationship to meals.  
8.4 Rationale for Selected Dose  
The standard scaling method for comparable dosing of biologic drugs between experimental animals 
and humans is on a mg/kg basis. The diet -induced obese mice used in Lumen’s  preclinical  studies 
averaged 55 grams in weight , and in our clinical studies , we will be scaling to an obese human weight of 
approximately 90 kg. Therefore,  the scaling factor is 1,636  fold.  
The highest dose of LMN -0801 administered to obese mice was 0.2mg of leptin daily . At this highest 
dose , there were no observed adverse effects . There are practical and ethical limitations on 
  Version 1.0, February 6, 2025  
Lumen Bioscience, Inc. ©  CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY  Page  18 
administering even larger doses of oral biologic to animals, particularly daily gavage administration in 
rodents (which is associated with oesophageal  rupture and animal stress ) so for planning purposes , we 
may consider this dosing level the no observed adverse effect level ( NOAEL ).  
The human equivalent dose  (HED ) on this conventional scaling metric is 327  mg per dose. The highest 
leptin dose we will use in this trial is 30mg/dose , more than 10 -fold lower. Furthermore, in preclinical  
studies , none of the doses tested in mouse models resulted in detectable levels of leptin in serum. 
Consequently, the HED  represents a n even  lower level of systemic leptin exposure than previously 
tested in parenteral ly delivered  leptin analogue studies  in humans. This is also lower than the 
recommended dosage of the marketed leptin analogue (metreleptin) . It is a notable advantage of oral 
biologic drugs that  exposure is limited to the targeted tissues in the GI tract  and, in the event dose -
related adverse events a re observed, the natural processes of the GI tract (peristalsis and proteolysis) 
will automatically and rapidly remove the biologic drug on treatment cessation.  
8.5 Blinding and Dispensing of Study  Product  
The site pharmacy will dispense LMN -0801  or placebo capsules according to the pharmacy manual.  All 
capsules will be dispensed according to the participant’s  treatment number  and group . Dispensing 
packets, with appropriate labels , will be provided to  each individual participant . The process for 
preparing LMN -0801 and placebo, as well as blinding and packaging, is detailed in  the pharmacy manual.  
8.6 Storage and Handling  
The study  product will be kept in a locked area of the study pharmacy . Pending completion of longer -
term stability studies, LMN -0801 should be refrigerated , 35-46°F (2-8°C) and protected from moisture, 
light, and extreme heat during storage  and transport . Study product should not be frozen.  
Only enrolled study participants may receive the assigned study  product  in accordance with all 
applicable regulatory requirements. In the event the participant loses their assigned study  product , 
replacement doses will be provided. Upon completion of  the study , participants will be asked to bring 
the remaining  study  product  in their possession to the study clinic for collection.  
The principal investigator  is responsible for maintaining accurate records of the processing and use of all 
clinical trial materials. Upon completion of the study, study  product  will be subjected to final inspection 
and reconciliation.  
Unused, partially  used, and fully used (empty) containers will be destroyed or returned to Lumen in 
accordance with instructions provided in the p harmacy manual. Documentation of destruction will be 
retained by the site pharmacy with the study files.  
Drug accountability  will be conducted during monitoring visits to ensure appropriate receipt, storage, 
dispensing, and documentation of returned study drug.  
9 Safety Management  
9.1 Tolerability ; Potential Toxicities  
The first dose of study drug will be administrated to each enrolled participant while being directly 
observed. After receiving the study drug, each participant will be monitored for two hours to assess for 
tolerability. At the end of two hours, vital signs and any reactions or adverse event s (AEs) will be 
  Version 1.0, February 6, 2025  
Lumen Bioscience, Inc. ©  CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY  Page  19 
recorded. If necessary, participants will be monitored for an additional two to four  hours for resolution 
of the AE. 
The anticipated risks and potential toxicities of LMN -0801 are estimated to be similar to, but less acute 
than, those reported in parenteral delivery studies with leptin analogues. No toxicities  have been 
published with respect to oral leptin, but it is possible that there may be risks and toxicities generally 
associated with parenterally administered protein therapeutics . For example, metreleptin —the injection  
leptin analogue currently on the marke t—is associated with the development of transient neutralis ing 
anti-leptin antibodies in a minority of patients  (U.S. Food and Drug Administration 2014) . However, s ince 
the lept in analogue within  LMN -0801 is a protein macromolecule administered orally, systemic 
absorption is not anticipated , and  so the risk of formation of anti -leptin  antibodies is thought to be 
attenuated . The most common (<10%) side effects noted in metreleptin clin ical trials were headache, 
hypoglycaemia  and abdominal pain  (U.S. Food and Drug Administration 2014) . Please see the 
Investigator’s  Brochure for additional information.  
9.2 Adverse Events  
The PI is responsible for documenting AEs according to the guidelines below.  
For the purposes of this study, an AE is defined as: “any untoward medical occurrence or change in a 
clinical trial participant having received a biologic or medicinal product, whether or not considered 
treatment  related .”  
AEs may occur in any phase of the clinical study. Events meeting the AE definition include:  
• a noxious, pathological, or unintended change in anatomical, physiologic, or metabolic functions as 
indicated by physical signs, symptoms, and/or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities;  
• exacerbation or worsening of pre -existing conditions or events;  
• intercurrent illnesses, injuries, or vaccine or drug interaction; or  
• worsening of abnormal clinical laboratory values.  
Stable, pre -existing conditions and/or elective procedures are not AEs.  
A serious adverse event ( SAE) is any AE that at any dose:  
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening.  
Note: the term ‘life-threatening ’ in the definition of ‘serious ’ refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe).  
• Requires inpatient hospitalisation  or prolongation of an existing hospitalisation .  
Note: only hospitalisations  that are longer than expected based on Investigator judgement, will 
be considered prolonged hospitalisations .  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
Note: results in a substantial disruption of a person’s  ability to conduct normal life functions.  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Note: a congenital anomaly/birth defect that occurs in the offspring of a participant exposed to 
the IP  
  Version 1.0, February 6, 2025  
Lumen Bioscience, Inc. ©  CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY  Page  20 
Abnormal laboratory findings (e.g., serum chemistry, haematology, coagulation, and urinalysis) or other 
abnormal assessments (e.g., vital signs, and physical examination findings) that are judged by the PI as 
clinically significant (CS) will be recorded as AEs or SAEs if they meet the definitions stated above. 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are detected after 
the first administration of the study drug or are present at baseline and significantly worsen following 
administration of the study dru g will be reported as AEs or SAEs. The PI will exercise his/her medical and 
scientific judgement in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding, or other abnormal assessment, 
is CS.  
9.3 Documenting and Reporting A dverse Event s 
All observed or volunteered AEs —regardless of suspected causal relationship to the study drug —must 
be recorded on the AE page of the CRF.  
Detection and recording of study related AEs and SAEs extend  from the signing of the consent form until 
completion of the last study related procedure (including follow -up for safety assessments). Any AE 
reported or observed at or after the start of dosing  with study drug will be recorded as a treatment -
emergent AE (TEAE) or SAE.  
The PI must assess all AEs for seriousness, severity, and relation to the study drugs. The PI will follow all 
AEs, regardless of seriousness or severity, until the AE or its sequelae resolve or stabilise  at a level 
acceptable to the PI. Clinical management of an AE is at the discretion of the PI.  
9.3.1 Assessment of Severity  
The Investigator will make an assessment of severity for each AE and SAE reported during the study. The 
assessment will be based on the Investigator’s  clinical judgment. The severity of each AE and SAE will be 
graded using the most current version of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE) 5 -point scale : 
Grade  Definition  
I Mild  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms: clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not 
indicated.  
II Moderate  Minimal, local, or non -invasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
instrumental ADL.  
III Severe  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life  threatening: hospitalisation  or 
prolongation of hospitalisation  indicated; disabling; limiting self -care ADL.  
IV Life-threatening  Life-threatening consequences: urgent intervention indicated.  
V Death  Death related to AE.  
 
9.3.2 Assessment of  Causality  
The Investigator will make an assessment as to the relationship between study drug and the occurrence 
of each AE/SAE. The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine whether or not the AE/SAE is 
causally related to the study drug. Alternative caus es, such as natural history of any underlying diseases, 
concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the study drug 
will be considered and investigated. The Investigator will also consult the Investigator’s  Brochur e in the 
determination of his/her assessment.  
  Version 1.0, February 6, 2025  
Lumen Bioscience, Inc. ©  CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY  Page  21 
The causal relationship of the study drug to an AE/SAE will be rated according to the following 2 -point 
scale : 
Causal Relationship  Definition  
Not related  Temporal association with study drug administration is lacking or other causative factors 
(e.g., participant’s  clinical state or environmental factors or other therapies administered) 
more likely explain the event  
Related  There is a reasonable temporal association with administration of study drug or the event is 
more likely explained by the investigational product than by another cause (i.e., the AE 
shows a pattern of response consistent with previous knowledge of the stud y drug).  
 
The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements, therefore, the Investigator must make an assessment of causality based on all available 
information for every event and prior to transmission of an SAE  Form to the Sponsor. The Investigator 
may change his/her opinion regarding causality in light of followup information and amend the SAE 
Form and the eCRF accordingly.  
9.4 Expedited Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
For the purposes of this study, a serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as  any untoward medical 
occurrence that, at any dose:  
• Results in death;  
• Is life -threatening (i.e., the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred; it 
does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe);  
• Requires inpatient hospitalisation  or prolongation of existing hospitalisation ; 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  or 
• Is an important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalisation  but may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it 
may jeopardise  the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.   
In the event of a n SAE, within 24 hours of becoming aware of an SAE occurrence, the following  
information must be sent  by the PI via email (preferred) or telephone to the Medical Monitor:  
• Protocol IND number, study drug, PI name, and contact number  
• Participant identification number  
• Narrative description of SAE, onset date, most recent date of study drug administration, 
severity, relationship, and participant’s  status  
AND email  the following documents to the Medical Monitor, Lumen Bioscience:  
• Cover sheet  
• AE CRF 
• Supplemental SAE CRF 
• Concomitant medication CRF or a list of concomitant medications  
• Medical record progress notes including pertinent laboratory/diagnostic test results  
The PI will assess all SAEs as being either related or unrelated to the administered product.  
  Version 1.0, February 6, 2025  
Lumen Bioscience, Inc. ©  CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY  Page  22 
The PI must also report SAEs to the appropriate HREC that approved the protocol according otto their 
requirements. All SAEs will be reported to the HREC within 72 hours of the PI becoming aware of the 
event:

9.5 Safety Review  
9.5.1 Safety Review Committee  
A data safety monitoring board  (DSMB)  will not be established for this study, however safety and 
tolerability data collected from participants will be reviewed by a safety  review committee (SRC) 
consisting of  the principal investigator ( PI), the independent medical monitor, and the sponsor medical 
monitor. The SRC will convene when the first 12 participants (10% of recruitment target) complete Day 
7. Subsequent SRC meetings will be convened following outcomes and decisions  from the first SRC 
meeting.  Safety labs, including lipid profile assessments, AEs/SAEs and conco mitant medications  
collected at the Day 7 visit will be included in the SRC review.  
9.5.2 Dose Stopping Rules  
AEs that will prompt stopping the investigational product administration for all subjects and review 
include:  
• Any individual experiencing any SAE considered related to the investigational products ; 
• If two or more subjects experience the same or similar unanticipated adverse event that is Grade 3 
in severity or higher ; 
• If the accumulation of SAEs and/or severe AEs collectively raises a safety concern in the opinion of 
the PI, independent m edical monitor, or sponsor  medical monitor;  
• If any individual experiences liver function tests or creatinine increased to 3 times the upper limit of 
normal ; 
• If any individual experiences significant spontaneous bleeding or platelet count < 100 X 10^9/L ; 
• If any individual experiences coagulation disorders characterised  by prolonged PT; or PTT or 
abnormal INR greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal ; or 
• If any individual experiences neutrophil values < 1.0 x 109/L . 
The decision to restart the study will be made by consensus of the independent medical monitor, the 
sponsor’s  medical monitor, and the PI. The decision to stop the study will be communicated to the HREC 
and, similarly, the decision to re -start a study will also be communicated to the HREC.  
Administration of the investigational product will be discontinued for any subject that develops:  
• A serious adverse event considered related to the investigational product; or  
• An adverse event that is Grade 3 or higher and considered related to the investigational product; or  
• The PI deems that stopping the investigational product administration is in the best interest of the 
subject.

10 Statistical Considerations  
10.1 Introduction  
The study aims to evaluate  LMN -0801 across dose levels , frequency of dosing, and formulations . The 
design of experiments methodology is the most efficient way to generate statistically reliable data with 
the fewest study participant s. This approach aligns with the U.S. FDA’s  model -informed drug 
development initiative (MIDD). The primary goals of the FDA’s  MIDD program are to leverage newer 
statistical methods to “accelerate the development of new medical products and enable more informed 
decision -making ” (Madabushi et al. 2022) . 
See Section  4.1 for more information about the statistical study design . 
10.2 Analysis of Safety  
The analysis of safety will include all participants who received study drug. Safety will be evaluated from 
reported AEs, vital signs, physical examination findings, and clinical laboratory values as described 
below:  
• The incidence and number of all reported AEs and treatment -related AEs will be tabulated by 
cohort. AEs will be classified by organ system classification.  
• AEs and SAEs will be summarised by organ system classification, severity, and relationship to study 
drug. In the event of multiple occurrences of the same AE with the same preferred term in the same 
participant, the AE will be reported as the number of AEs  and with the AE counted only once. The 
incidence of AEs will be tabulated by organ system class and cohort.  
• SAEs will be presented as listings by cohort. The event, start and stop dates and times, relationship 
to study drug, severity, and outcome will be presented. Outcomes attributed to SAEs will be 
tabulated separately by cohort.  
Tolerability will be assessed by the proportion of participants completing study drug and remaining in 
the study and free from possibly drug -related and dose -limiting SAEs to the end of follow -up.  
The overall number of participants receiving LMN -0801 is N=108. If no participants (0 of 108) experience 
moderate to severe treatment -related adverse events, then the 95% confidence interval probability of a 
moderate to severe treatment -related adverse event is [0.00%, 3.43%]. That is, we can be 95% confident 
that the true rate of moderate to severe treatment -related adverse events is no more than 3.43%  if no 
participants (0 of 108) experience moderate to severe treatment -related adverse events.  
If treatment -related adverse events are reported, prevalence and severity will be reported in tabular 
form. Additionally , treatment -related adverse event s will be analysed  for dose, schedule and 
formulation dependence.  
10.3 Sample Size Considerations  (Preliminary Efficacy Assessment)  
The group size was selected based o n simple pairwise comparison of percent weight loss between 
Cohort  1 (placebo) and active treatment Cohort s 5-7 (medium leptin)  or between Cohort 1 and Cohort s 
82-10 (high leptin) .. With a significance level of p<0.05  (α=0.05) and a power of 90% ( ß=0.1), a t -test 
would conclude statistical difference  in percent weight loss  between active cohorts with n=12 per 
cohort if Cohen’s  d ≥ 1.38516.  
  Version 1.0, February 6, 2025  
Lumen Bioscience, Inc. ©  CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY  Page  24 
In this context , Cohen’s  d is the differen ce in mean percent weight loss divided by the pooled standard 
deviation of percent weight loss across both groups  (Ghusn et al. 2022; Wilding et al. 2021)  report 
variation in weight loss a t different time points to be proportional to mean weight loss in a cohort of 
patients , and so the variation in percent weight loss is generally 60% (cv=sd/mean=0.6)  (Ghusn et al. 
2022; Wilding et al. 2021)  If the mean percent weight loss in Cohort 1 is 1%, 2% or 3% , then Cohen’s  d ≥ 
1.38516 when the mean percent weight loss in an active treatment Cohort 4 or 7 is ≥ 2.68%, 5.36% or 
8.05%, respectively . Wilding (STEP -1) report mean place bo and semaglutide percent weight loss at 28 
weeks as 2.8 4% and 11.7 %, respectively ; Ghusn reports report mean percent weight loss from 
semaglutide  injection  at 12 weeks 6 months  as 5.92% and 6 10.9%, respectively . Wilding report s mean 
percent weight loss from placebo at 12 weeks as 2.17 %. Thus, the study is adequately powered to detect 
clear differences in LMN -0801 from placebo treatment if the effect size of LMN -0801 is equivalent to 
half that of semaglutide injection  at 1224 weeks.  
FAdditionally , the primary analysis will be performed using repeated -measures, mixed -effects , modelling  
using the totality of the data set to assess  the effect s of LMN -0801 . These methods provide more power 
than landmark t -test, so the powering calculations above are conservative.  
10.4 Statistical Analysis Plan  
A preliminary statistical analysis plan will be drafted prior to enrolling  the first participant  and finalised  
prior to unblinding . 
11 Data Handling and Record Keeping  
The PI will maintain complete  and accurate documentation for the study. All required study data will be 
clearly and accurately recorded by authorised  study personnel in the electronic CRFs (eCRFs ). Only 
designated study site personnel shall record or change data in an eCRF. The PI will be responsible for the 
procurement of data and for quality of data recorded in the eCRFs. Original observations entered 
directly into the eCRFs will be  considered source data. Study -specific procedures detail how each form 
will be completed. The study coordinator will ensure accuracy of the eCRFs. All source documents will be 
retained at the site.  
A detailed data management plan will be written by the study team and approved by the PI prior to 
enrolling the first participant . The plan will be drafted prior to study initiation but will be finalised  before 
study close -out and database lock.  
12 Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
12.1 Monitoring  
During the study and at the close -out, a monitor from Lumen or its representative will have regular 
contacts with the site for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the PI. 
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable . 
• Confirm that the study  team is adhering to the protocol, data are being accurately recorded in the 
CRFs, and study drug  accountability checks are being performed . 
  Version 1.0, February 6, 2025  
Lumen Bioscience, Inc. ©  CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY  Page  25 
• Perform source data verification , includ ing a comparison of the data in the CRFs with the participant  
medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records relevant to the study  (require s direct 
access to all original records for each participant  (e.g., clinic charts) ). 
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to Lumen . 
• Confirm that AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on CRFs, that SAEs have been 
forwarded to Lumen or its representative , and that SAEs meeting  criteria for reporting have been 
forwarded to the HREC . 
The monitor will be available between visits if the PI or other staff need information or advice. The PI 
assumes ultimate responsibility for the conduct of the study and must remain readily accessible 
throughout the study.  
12.2 Clinical Research Monitoring  
Lumen  monitoring responsibilities will be performed by an independent clinical research associate 
(CRA ). Monitoring will be conducted according to a monitoring plan and applicable standard operating 
procedures . The CRA or other Lumen  representatives may inspect all documents and records 
maintained by the PI, and t he clinical study site will permit access to such records. The PI will obtain, as 
part of informed consent, permission for authorised  representatives of Lumen , or regulatory authorities, 
to review, in confidence, any records identifying individuals in this clinical study.  
The PI will notify Lumen  within 24 hours following contact by a regulatory agency. The PI and study 
coordinator will be available to respond to reasonable requests and audit queries made by authorised  
representatives of regulatory agencies. The PI will provide Lumen  with copies of all correspondence that 
may affect the review of the current study and the PI’s qualification s to act  as a PI in the study .  
Lumen  will provide any needed assistance in responding to regulatory audits or correspondence. The PI 
will permit independent auditors (employees of Lumen  or an external company designated by Lumen ) to 
verify source data validation of the regularly monitored clinical trial. The auditors will compare the 
entries in the CRFs with the source data and evaluate the study site for its adherence to the clinical 
study protocol , ICH Good Clinical Practice  guidelines , and applicable regulatory requirements.  
Lumen  will arrange local monitoring prior to beginning, at initiation, during the study, and at closeout by 
the study monitor or designee.  
12.3 Medical Monitor  
The designated independent medical monitor shall be available for consultation with the PI and will 
serve as a liaison between the clinical study site and Lumen . The PI will consult with the medical monitor  
on issues related to participant  enrolment  and continued participation as needed.  
The medical monitor  will be  required to review all unanticipated problems involving risk to participant s, 
SAEs, and all participant  deaths associated with the protocol, and provide an unbiased written report of 
the event. At a minimum, the medical monitor  should comment on the event outcomes and in the case 
of a SAE or death, comment on the relationship to participation in the study. The medical monitor  
should indicate concurrence or non -concurrence with the details of the report provided by the PI. 
Reports for events determined by either the PI or medical monitor  to be related or unrelated to 
participation and reports of events resulting in death should be promptly forwarded to the HREC .  
  Version 1.0, February 6, 2025  
Lumen Bioscience, Inc. ©  CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY  Page  26 
12.4 Protocol Deviation Management  
Other than minimal -risk changes, all unanticipated major problems involving human participants or 
others will be reported promptly to the HREC. No such changes will be made to the research without 
HREC approval unless necessary to eliminate apparent immedi ate hazards to human participants. Minor 
minimal -risk deviations will be made on site as needed and documented for subsequent review within a 
reasonable time . 
Deviations from the protocol that potentially impact participant safety will be promptly reported to the 
medical monitor, HREC, and Lumen. Other deviations will be reported at the time of continuing review.  
13 Regulatory, Ethical , and Study Oversight Considerations  
13.1 Human Research Ethics Committee Review  
The PI must verify that the HREC  has approved the clinical protocol, informed consent form (ICF), and 
recruitment materials  for the study prior to conducting study evaluations. Initial HREC  approval, and all 
materials approved by the HREC  for this study  must be maintained by the PI and made available for 
inspection.  
All amendments to the protocol, ICF, and/or questionnaires —including a change of PI—will be 
submitted to the HREC  for review and approval prior to implementation. The PI is responsible for 
informing the HREC  of any amendment to the protocol.  
The PI is also responsible  for providing the HREC  with reports of any reportable SAEs  from any other 
study conducted with the study drug . Lumen  will provide this information to the PI. 
13.2 Written Informed Consent  
The ICF will be prepared by Lumen . The ICF will clearly describe the nature, scope, and potential risks 
and benefits of the study in a language that the participant  understands. The ICF will conform to all  the 
requirements for informed consent according to ICH guidelines on Good Clinical Practice  (GCP ) and U.S. 
FDA guidelines. The ICF will adhere to the ethical principles of the Declaration  of Helsinki .  
Prior to study  initiation , Lumen  will obtain the HREC’s  approval of the ICF. The HREC -approved ICF will 
be given to each volunteer. The volunteers will be given adequate time to discuss the study with the PI 
or site staff and to decide whether  to participate. The PI or research staff designee will ensure that the 
potential participant  is given full and adequate oral and written information about the nature, purpose, 
possible risks, and potential benefits of the study. The participant must also be notified that they are 
free to discontinue the study at any time . 
Each volunteer who agrees to participate in the trial and who signs the ICF will be given a copy of the 
signed and dated document. Execution of ICF may be completed electronically (e.g., Docusign). The 
original signed ICF will be retained by the PI in the study files.  
The ICF and other information provided to participant s will be revised whenever important new and 
relevant information becomes  available . All such revised materials must be re-approved by the HREC  
prior to use. The PI or site staff  will fully inform any affected participant s of the changes if relevant to 
the participant’s  willingness to continue participation in the study. Participant s must read and sign any 
revised ICFs  and the originals must be retained by the PI as above . 
  Version 1.0, February 6, 2025  
Lumen Bioscience, Inc. ©  CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY  Page  27 
13.3 Participant  Compensation  
Compensation for participation will be provided only for completed study procedures designated for 
compensatory payment . Participant s will be compensated for time and travel  associated with study 
participation . 
13.4 Privacy and Confidentiality  
The PI will exercise  reasonable precautions to maintain the confidentiality of participants’  identities 
within the constraints of applicable regulatory requirements. On exported electronic source data or any 
other documents submitted to Lumen , participant s will be identified only by their  participant  number. 
Documents not for submission to Lumen  (e.g., participant  identification log and original ICF s), will be 
maintained by the PI in strict confidence.  
13.5 Regulatory Documentation  
Before trial start,  the “essential documents ” (as defined in ICH E6 ) will be generated and placed in both 
the files  of Lumen  and the study centre . Additional essential documents will be added to both files as 
new information becomes  available and at the completion or termination of the trial.  
13.6 Protection of Human Subjects  
Declaration of Helsinki . The PI will conduct this study in accordance with the Declaration  of Helsinki . 
Good Clinical Practice and Regulatory Compliance . The PI will conduct this study in accordance with the 
principles of GCP , current ICH guidelines , and the requirements of local regulatory authorities regarding 
the conduct of clinical trials and the protection of human subjec ts.
