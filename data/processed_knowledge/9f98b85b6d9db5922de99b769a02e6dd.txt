Methodology:  
This was a multi -centre, double -blind, randomized, 2 -period cross -over study o f CNV1014802 versus 
placebo.  Following a screening period, 137 subjects with a diagnosis of neuropathic pain due to 
lumbosacral radiculopathy (LSR) were enrolled into a run -in phase where they received single blind 
placebo medication for two weeks.  On Day 15, 82 subjects were randomized  to take part in two 
sequential 22 -day dosing periods  (AM dose only on day 22) .  Subjects were randomized  in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive either 350mg CNV1014802 BID followed by placebo BID, or vice versa.  The dosing periods 
were separated by a 13 day washout period and were followed by a 7 day run out, during which subjects 
received placebo.

Criteria for evaluation:  
Efficacy:  
 Change in average daily neuropathic pain score from  baseline to Week 3 based on the 11 point 
Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale (PI -NRS).  
 Change in average daily pain score from baseline to Week 1, 2 and 3 of treatment and 1 week 
following the end of randomized treatment, based on the 11 point PI -NRS.  Pain intensity for 
neuropathic pain associated with lumbosacral radiculopathy and that for low back pain in the 
lumbosacral spine was to be scored separately.  
 Proportion of subjects who had ≥30% and  ≥50% reduction in average daily pain score for 
neuropathic pain from LSR and low back pain (each separately) relative to baseline during 
Weeks 1, 2 and 3 of treatment and 1 week following the end of randomized treat ment.  
 Change in the amount of rescue medication used from baseline to Week 3 of treatment  
 Change in Galer Neuropathic Pain Scale from baseline to Week 3 of treatment.  
 Change in average disability score from baseline to Week 3 of treatment based on Oswestr y 
Disability Index.  
 Proportion of subjects who had “improved”, “much improved” or “very much improved” 
relative to baseline on each of the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) and Clinical 
Global Impression of Change (CGIC) on Week 3 of treatment.  
 Change in pain (11 -point NRS) from baseline on straight leg raise.  
 Change in angle of extension of leg from baseline during straight leg raise.  
Pharmacokinetics:  
 Pre-dose and post -dose plasma CNV1014802 concentrations – AUC(0 -24)-ss, Cmin -ss and 
Cmax -ss

Statistical methods:  
Efficacy Analysis:  
The intent -to-treat population, defined as all rand omized subjects who received at least one dose of 
randomized  study medication, was used for all efficacy analyses.  
In general, continuous data was summarized using descriptive statistics.  The primary e fficacy analysis 
was performed using a mixed effect m odel including subject as a random effect.  For statistical analyses, 
all tests were two -sided with significance interpreted at the 5% level.  
Subjects randomized into this study either had radiculopathic pain in one or both lower limbs only, or one 
or both  lower limbs and back pain together.  If subjects only had pain in one or both lower limbs then the

 primary endpoint was the PI -NRS score associated with the pain in their worst affected lower limb (most 
painful lower limb determined at Screening).  If the  subject had pain in one or both lower limbs and back 
pain then the PI -NRS score for the worst affected lower limb was used as the primary endpoint for that 
subject, but the PI -NRS score for the back was also recorded and analysed separately as a secondary  
endpoint.  
 
Post Hoc Analyses  
Post hoc analyses were conducted on the primary endpoint and responder rates to explore the treatment 
effect in different subpopulations.   
In addition to the model described by the SAP (period level baseline), analyses of the  primary endpoint 
and responder rates were also conducted using a mixed effects model that included both a period and 
subject level (mean of baseline 1 & 2) baseline as fixed effects.   
 
Pharmacokinetics Analysis:  
The PK analysis population consisted of 78  subjects (43 males, 35 females).  Each subject had 11 PK 
samples taken, of which four at steady state on active treatment (two pre -dose and two 2 hrs post -dose).  
The total number of concentration records (on active treatment only) in the final datafile w as 287.  The 
observations were visually compared to the study specific (regimen and population) predictions (median 
and 90% prediction interval) from a historical popPK model based on healthy volunteer phase I data.  
Subsequently, non -linear mixed effect m odelling was used, applying the historical popPK model, to 
estimate the PK parameters for each individual.  For the final model all PK parameters were fixed to the 
healthy volunteer values except for the between subject variability on CL/F.  The data did n ot allow other 
parameters to be estimated with sufficient confidence.  The final model described the observations well 
and neither obvious biases, nor evidence of non -compliance were observed.  The individual PK 
parameters were then used to derive (through  simulation and calculation) the individual exposures at 
steady state, assuming full compliance.  
 
 
 
Safety Analysis:  
The safety population, defined as all subjects who had received any amount of study medication, was 
used for safety analyses.  Safety data was presented in tabular and/or graphical format and summarized 
descriptively.  
SUMMARY: RESULTS  
Efficacy:  
 CNV1014802 significantly improved neuropathic pain in LSR patients.  On the primary 
endpoint, there was a difference in the average change in PI -NRS for neuropathic pain from 
baseline to Week 3 of -0.43 (p= 0.0255) for CNV1014802 compared to placebo.  
 A statistically significant effect on neuropathic pain levels was seen from Week 2 onwards.  
 There were no stati stically significant effects of CNV1014802 on PI -NRS assessments of lower 
back pain – non-neuropathic.  
 The effect of CNV1014802 on neuropathic pain was most pronounced in monotherapy patients.  
There was a difference in the average change in PI -NRS for neu ropathic pain from baseline to 
Week 3 of -0.73 (p= 0.0038) for CNV1014802 compared to placebo in monotherapy patients.  
 There was no evidence that patients with no prior surgery responded any differently to 
CNV1014802 than those with a history of surgery.  
 There were no statistically significant differences between CNV1014802 and placebo on any of 
the other secondary efficacy endpoints as analysed using the period 1 baseline only.  
 Sensitivity analyses conducted analy sing the first period only in a between sub ject analysis  
showed a similar magnitude of effect of PI -NRS in Week 3 compared to baseline, in both the all 
subject ITT population ( -0.43, p= 0.1858) and the Monother apy subjects ( -0.81, p=0. 0555).  
 
Pharmacokinetics:  
 CNV1014802 plasma concentrations and exposures were as expected from the healthy volunteer

 Phase I  PK data . 
 Individual PK exposures could be estimated in 78/79 subjects that received active treatment 350 
BID.  
 The median (90% percentile range) derived exposures were AUC(0 -24)-ss 55 (40 - 78) 
[μg*hr/ml], Cmax -ss 3.7 (2.7 - 5.0) [μg/ml], Cmin -ss 1.4 (0.9 - 2.0) [μg/ml].  
 The PK data suggested no evidence of major non -compliance.  
 
Safety:  
 CNV1014802 was well tolerated; 58% subjects dosed with CNV1014802 reported TEAE‟s 
compared to 49% dosed with pl acebo.  
 The most common treatment emergent adverse events occurring in this study were headache 
(CNV1014802: 12 subjects ( 15.2%); placebo: 5 subjects (6. 8%)) and dizziness (CNV1014802: 9 
subjects (11. 4%); placebo: 3 subjects ( 4.1%)).  The majority of all T EAE‟s were mild in 
severity.  
 A total of 8 ( 10.1%) CNV1014802 and 1 (1. 4%) placebo treated subjects were discontinued due 
to TEAE‟s.  One CNV1014802 subject was discontinued due to a rash which was considered to 
be related to study drug.  
 ALT increases of >3 xULN were observed in two subjects dosed with CNV1014802.   One 
subject was discontinued from the study; this subject also had significant elevations of AST, 
GGT and alkaline phosphatase.  Serum bilirubin was normal in both subjects.  The abnormal 
laborator y parameters in both subjects rapidly fell once CNV1014802 was withdrawn.  
 No other clinically significant changes in laboratory test parameters, were reported.  
 There were no clinically significant changes in BP, heart rate or ECG parameters associated 
with CNV1014802  
 
SUMMARY: CONCLUSION  
The primary objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of repeat oral dosing of CNV1014802 
on neuropathic pain in subjects with lumbosacral radiculopathy.  There was a small but statistically 
significant effec t of CNV1014802 compared to placebo at Week 3 on the change in neuropathic pain 
associated with LSR, but not with low back pain.  The improvement in the monotherapy subset was 
greater than in the overall ITT population.  No significant changes in the secon dary endpoints were 
observed.   Whilst improvements in pain ratings  were seen , there were no statistically significant 
differences between CNV1014802 and placebo on any of the other secondary efficacy endpoints .  
However, these were  analysed using the perio d 1 baseline only  for both treatment periods baseline .  
CNV1014802 plasma concentrations and exposures were as expected from phase I healthy volunteer data 
and there was no evidence of major non -compliance.  
 
CNV1014802 was generally well tolerated with the  most common adverse events being headache and 
dizziness.  No serious adverse events were reported and only 2 subjects experienced severe treatment 
emergent adverse events (headache and liver function test abnormal) which both resolved without 
sequelae.  Two subjects treated with CNV1014802 reported rises in ALT greater than 3x ULN which fell 
rapidly once CNV1014802 was terminated.  One subject was discontinued with a rash which was related 
to CNV1014802.  No other clinically significant changes in laborato ry test parameters, vital signs or 
ECG changes were reported.
