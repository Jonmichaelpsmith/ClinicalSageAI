Clinical Research
 POINT OF VIEW
within the field of research, which require greater human 
and infrastructural resources as well as imply the need for 
a greater skill set and expertise on the part of professionals 
(3,4).
In this context, the centers that conduct clinical trials 
found themselves having to face this increased complexity 
which, from their point of view, is characterized by three 
main factors:
– increased quality standards required by the regulatory 
agencies, both toward the research centers and toward 
the promoters (both profit and nonprofit) (5,6);
– increased bureaucratization of processes, with a conse-
quent increase in the document production at trial sites 
as requested by sponsors and stakeholders (7);
– increased complexity of study designs, with the intro-
duction of innovative designs, such as platform and/
or adaptive studies, often characterized by a Bayesian 
statistical basis. This increased complexity compared 
to traditional trials calls for greater efforts from clini-
cal centers, in terms of procedures to be implemented 
and time to be dedicated to research activities, espe-
cially as a consequence of potential interim analysis 
and the dynamics of ongoing development of the study 
protocol (8).Clinical trial units and clinical research coordinators:

ABSTRACT
We are currently witnessing an increase in procedural and managerial complexities within the field of clinical re-
search, which require greater human and infrastructural resources as well as imply the need for a greater skill set 
and expertise on the part of professionals. Within this frame of reference clinical trial units and clinical research 
coordinators play a vital role in the design and conduct of clinical trials in Italy.  There is a current recruitment 
and retention crisis for this specialist role due to a complex set of factors, most likely to have come to a head due 
to the lack of recognition at the Italian institutional level, that lead to precarious work contracts, lack of identity, 
and excessive turnover at experimental sites.  This article, led by the Italian Group of Clinical Research Coordina -
tor (GIDMcrc), presents some of the issues and ways in which national stakeholders may be able to address this.

COVID-19 emergency has led to a collective awareness 
of the importance of promoting and supporting clinical 
research, in order to allow the development of new innova-
tive therapies, as well as to improve the appropriateness of 
existing treatments (1,2). Treating and innovating has there-
fore become a primary need for both patients and the scien-
tific community.
At the same time, especially in the last decade, clinical 
research has evolved and changed both from a regulatory and 
methodological point of view. In fact, we are currently wit -
nessing an increase in procedural and managerial complexities

CTU and CRC: a system facing crisis?2 
In order to adequately face these challenges, over the 
years, the research centers have therefore had to increase 
the workforce assigned to clinical research, including clini -
cal research coordinators (CRCs) and research nurses. At the 
same time, it was necessary to implement and adapt their 
infrastructures through the creation of clinical trial units 
(CTUs) responsible for the management and coordination of 
the various activities required both in profit and academic/
nonsponsored clinical research contexts (9,10).
Currently, human resources and clinical research support 
infrastructures represent the two cornerstones necessary for 
the correct conduct of clinical research. 
The difficulties that trial centers are facing:  
infrastructures and human capital 
Although the added value of clinical research for patients, 
research institutions, and the National Healthcare System 
(NHS) is now scientifically recognized (it is estimated that for 
every euro paid by the pharmaceutical company/sponsor to 
the experimental sites for the conduct of a clinical study, the 
NHS saves 2.77 euro for costs not incurred (11)), over the 
years, institutional support has often lacked on the two piv -
otal fronts of experimental centers: professionals dedicated 
to clinical research and support infrastructures.
Until now, there has been no reference guidelines or 
shared institutional indications setting a standard model 
or organization system for experimental centers in order 
to ensure the conduct of profit and nonprofit clinical trials 
according to the required standards. This lack of coordina -
tion and institutional support has therefore led to a hetero-
geneous development of research centers across the State, 
both in terms of geographical distribution and in terms of the 
establishment and development of the organizational appa -
ratus in support of clinical research (12).
A confirmation of this is the fact that many of the CTUs 
formed within the research centers are not formally recognized 
at an institutional and organizational level, often resulting in 
functional but not institutionalized operating units (13,14).
The institutions’ reluctance to provide any support has 
ultimately led to the impossibility, especially on the part of 
public research structures, to guarantee a stable contractual 
status to those professional figures specifically dedicated 
to clinical research (primarily research coordinators and 
research nurses), causing as a result a strong turnover within 
the clinical centers’ staff.
The role of the CRCs 
In the context of current clinical research, the figure of 
the CRC is now unanimously recognized as a fundamental 
element in order to guarantee the management and coordi -
nation of clinical trials according to the required quality stan-
dards (13,15,16).
Over the years this professional figure has evolved, 
acquiring specific technical and managerial skills that repre-
sent a strong added value for the clinical trial centers. These 
are professionals, who have achieved a bachelor’s degree 
in scientific subjects and gained valuable and essential skills 
during their postgraduate training. These skills are certainly 
useful to coordinate and conduct clinical studies promoted by pharmaceutical companies. It’s also important to underline 
their key role in the drafting, planning, and project manage-
ment of academic trials, and ensuring the compliance of the 
center with current legislation and structural and organiza-
tional requirements.
Despite the centrality of this professional figure, to date 
the figure of the CRC is not yet recognized at an institutional 
level in Italy. This lack of recognition has made it impossible 
over the years to include these professionals on a perma -
nent basis within the NHS, mainly proposing scholarships, 
Consultancy contracts subject to Value Added Tax (VAT), and 
fixed-term contracts for CRC (13).
Although in recent years many different attempts have 
been made, the Italian system has not yet managed to find a 
definitive solution to contractual precariousness: the classifi-
cation of staff within the researcher pyramid (which is limited 
to IRCCS) has in fact resulted in the chronicization of a contrac-
tual precariousness with no long-term and open-ended pros-
pects (17). On this note, the classification of CRCs in category 
D within the administrative/technical sector does not in fact 
allow the enhancement of these professionals both in terms of 
intracompany growth and salary upgrade (especially based on 
the professional’s training and technical-scientific skills).
Lack of identity and job description
The lack of institutional recognition of the figure of the 
CRC explains the absence of a consistent professional job 
description at the national level: the tasks attributed to the 
CRC may differ from one clinical research center to another, 
also based on the latter’s internal organization and proce-
dures. As a consequence of this, the actual activities carried 
out by the CRCs may vary significantly: from the management 
of regulatory and start-up procedures to data entry, manage-
ment and processing of experimental biological samples to 
the management of experimental drugs.
The lack of a well-defined identity for this figure therefore 
represents an element of further professional destabilization 
that is added to the contractual framework and which ulti -
mately hinders, even in the perception of the scientific com-
munity, the full recognition of skills and added value given to 
the clinical centers.
Excessive turnover
The lack of institutional recognition, lack of a permanent 
position within the Italian NHS, and lack of enhancement 
both at a contractual and competence level make it difficult 
for clinical centers to retain CRCs especially if experienced 
with strong technical skills.
CRCs with strong skills and experience can easily find job 
opportunities in pharmaceutical companies and contract 
research organizations, drawn by a better contractual status, 
the greater recognition of their skill set, as well as the oppor -
tunity for professional growth and salary upgrade. 
After investing in the training of high-level professionals in 
the world of clinical research, the centers are therefore faced 
with high rates of outbound turnover, putting a strain on effi-
ciency and organization (18).
In fact, there are several aspects that CTUs have to face as 
a result of excessive turnover, which, although common and

acceptable below a certain threshold, become unsustainable 
beyond a certain staff turnover rate:
– It is difficult to find a new resource to be included in the 
workforce who accepts the contractual and working con -
ditions proposed, in spite of the possibilities offered by 
the market.
– In the case of public structures, any CRC must be iden -
tified through comparative procedures or public tenders 
that imply very specific and lengthy technical timelines. As 
a result, it is impossible to replace staff quickly, thus leav -
ing the CTUs one unit short and the missed opportunity 
for a direct handover of ongoing activities between the 
outgoing and the incoming professionals.
– Loss of expertise and the need to consider a transition 
period for the incoming professional to complete specific 
training on internal procedures and processes.
– Loss of steadiness in the management of clinical trials 
with the need to update specific staff documentation, 
perform study-specific training, and the implementation 
of new profiles for any IT systems used.
– Continuous review of organizational charts and company 
training programs.
The excessive turnover of CRCs, certainly resulting from 
all the issues discussed so far, affects clinical centers and 
undermines the quality and efficiency of the work, indirectly 
increasing the workload and work-related tension within the 
staff of the CTUs.
Future and possible solutions
Investing in research, both presently and in the future, 
implies multiplying one’s investments guaranteeing bene-
fits and positive outcomes for citizens and patients, as well 
as direct and indirect advantages for the NHS and for related 
activities deriving from clinical research itself. Supporting clini-
cal research would trigger a win-win mechanism, with benefits 
extended throughout the country in terms of health experi-
ence, quality of services offered, and resource optimization.
In order to accomplish this, it will be necessary to break 
the ongoing latency of the institutions on this matter, placing 
clinical centers (regardless of their nature as research insti-
tute/IRCCS, hospitals, university hospitals, etc.) at the cen-
ter of a plan for restoration and investments aimed at the 
enhancement of human capital and institutionalization and 
optimization of infrastructures dedicated to clinical research.
These investments, therefore, also involve institutional 
recognition and contractual enhancement of the figure of 
the CRC, as well as the definition of a job description to be 
included in the National Health System.
Furthermore, the formal recognition of the CTUs, stan-
dardizing the paths and requirements at a national level, rep-
resents a necessary step in order to allow research centers to 
keep up with the increasingly global and competitive clinical 
research setting, particularly since the bar of infrastructural 
and quality requirements is continuously rising.
The institutional recognition of the CTUs would guaran-
tee a better defined organizational structure, providing them 
with a budget and objectives that would facilitate their activ -
ity by optimizing the available resources.Disclosures
