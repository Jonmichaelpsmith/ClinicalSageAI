International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) - 
www.ich.org; admin@ich.org  
The International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) 
is unique in bringing together the regulatory authorities and pharmaceutical industry to discuss scientific and 
technical aspects of drug registration. ICH’s mission is to promote public health by achieving greater 
harmonisation worldwide to ensure that safe, effective, and high-quality medicines are developed and 
registered in the most resource-efficient manner. Since its inception in 1990, ICH has gradually evolved to 
respond to the increasingly global face of drug development. Since the introduction of organisational changes 
in October 2015, ICH, as an independent, international, non-profit organisation, has grown and now includes 
eighteen Members and thirty-three Observers.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Background:  This study was built on the previous 2018/2019 assessment1where ICH selected the Centre for 
Innovation in Regulatory Science (CIRS) to collaborate on the development and the conduct of this project.  
Objectives:  This study aimed to monitor the adequacy of implementation and adherence to ICH Guidelines by 
regulatory authorities. The objectives were: 
 To assist the Management Committee in determining whether ICH non-Standing non-Founding Regulatory 
Members would meet the eligibility criteria for the ICH Management Committee (MC) elections in June 2021  
 To allow participating Observers interested in future ICH Membership to reference the survey findings to 
confirm their eligibility. 
Method: An online questionnaire and definitions developed in 2018 and updated in 2019 by CIRS in collaboration with 
ICH were adapted for the purpose of this study. The questionnaire was completed in January-March 2021 by 
companies (assessing all the participating authorities) and authorities (assessing themselves only).  
This questionnaire focused on assessing implementation and adherence to ICH Guidelines by ICH non-Standing, non-
Founding Regulatory Members (ANVISA, Brazil; NMPA, China; HSA, Singapore; MFDS, Republic of Korea; TFDA, 
Chinese Taipei and TITCK, Turkey) for Tier 2 and 3 Guidelines. The study was also open to ICH Observers on a voluntary 
basis, where INVIMA, Colombia; JFDA, Jordan; SAHPRA, South Africa and SFDA, Saudi Arabia participated in the study 
for Tier 1 ICH Guidelines. 
 
 
 
 
Results: The results demonstrate that in general, there is a strong level of implementation and adherence across the 
agencies studied, as well as alignment between the perception of the companies and the self-declaration of 
authorities studied. 10 regulatory authorities  (100% response rate) and 30 pharmaceutical companies  (75% response 
rate) participated in the 2021 study to undertake gap analysis, indicating strong interest and support for this initiative. 
Implementation 
o ICH non-Standing non-Founding Regulatory Members:  
 Tier 2: Two authorities implemented all of the Tier 2 Guidelines, while all of the authorities implemented 
the E2D and M4 Guidelines, followed by E2A (five out of six). Compared with 20191 report, results indicated 
an increase in implementation and adherence across most of the Tier 2 Guidelines 
 Tier 3: Five out of the six Regulatory Members implemented >70% of the Tier 3 Guidelines  
o ICH Observers: 
 Tier 1: Two out of the four ICH Observers implemented all three of the Tier 1 Guidelines 
Adherence: Across all the authorities, where implementation was confirmed, there was a good level of adherence to 
the ICH Guidelines, or it was too early to assess.  
Conclusion:  The results demonstrate authorities’ and companies’ continued commitment and support in ICH’s mission 
to achieve greater harmonisation worldwide and ensure that safe, effective, and high-quality medicines are 
developed, registered, and maintained in the most resource-efficient manner whilst meeting high standards. In 
addition, the study highlights progress made by authorities in implementing and adhering to ICH Guidelines since the 
2019 assessment and the results will be used to support training needs as well as ICH-membership related activities.

 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES 
In the ICH Assembly Rules of Procedure, it is stated that there should be a process for the Assembly to monitor 
the progress of international harmonisation and coordinate efforts to provide the current state of play of the 
implementation and adherence to the ICH Guidelines. 
On behalf of ICH, the ICH Founding Industry Members agreed that a pilot study, Phase 1, would be conducted 
in 2017 to obtain feedback from companies on their perspective and perception of implementing the ICH 
Guidelines. An independent third party (CIRS) developed and led a proof-of-concept survey of 
PhRMA/EFPIA/JPMA company members on their perspective and perception of the implementation status of 
Tier 1 and 2 ICH Guidelines. The Phase 1 study results demonstrated that a survey could be undertaken across 
companies, where the response rate was excellent, indicating strong interest in the project. 
In 2018, ICH approached CIRS to undertake a follow-on study to assess the adequacy of implementation and 
adherence to ICH Guidelines. The aim of this phase of the project, namely Phase 2a, was to build on the 
outcomes and lessons learned from Phase 1. CIRS developed an online questionnaire and definitions in 
collaboration with ICH and the ICH Implementation Subcommittee. The survey was completed by companies 
(assessing all the participating authorities) and authorities (assessing themselves only) to undertake a gap 
analysis. The report of this study has been published and endorsed by the ICH Management Committee (MC)1. 
In addition, CIRS prepared a report for ICH to analyse the study’s free-text comments further to support ICH 
work, including training efforts. 
At the ICH 2019 Meeting in Singapore, the ICH MC, together with the ICH Implementation Co-Leads (Jerry 
Stewart and Junko Sato), discussed and proposed that a follow-on survey should be conducted in 2020/2021. 
The remit of the study described in this report, here referred to as Phase 2b, was principally to assist the 
Management Committee in their elections. Data collection, data cleaning, and analysis occurred from January 
to March 2021, followed by delivering a tailored report to each authority and an overall draft report to the MC 
in April. After the draft report was delivered, the results were presented in May and June to the ICH MC and 
Assembly respectively.  
Goals and Objectives 
This study aimed to monitor the adequacy of implementation and adherence to ICH Guidelines by regulatory 
authorities, continuing the assessment initiated in 2019. 
The objectives were: 
 To assist the Management Committee in determining whether ICH non-Standing non-Founding 
Regulatory Members would meet the eligibility criteria for the MC elections in June 2021  
 To allow participating Observers interested in future ICH Membership to reference the survey findings 
to confirm their eligibility. 
The long-term objectives would be to establish a sustainable ICH-driven mechanism to assess implementation 
and adherence to the ICH Guidelines over time to inform ICH stakeholders on multiple areas as specified in the 
goals and, therefore, to fulfil the ICH mission.

 SCOPE AND METHOD 
CIRS adapted the study questionnaire and the online data collection tool (DCT) developed in collaboration with 
ICH as part of the 2019 Phase 2a study1. The study utilised the same definitions for ‘implementation’ and 
‘adherence’ developed jointly by ICH and the ICH Implementation Subcommittee as part of the 2017 Phase 1 
study (see Appendix 1). The questionnaire was completed between January and March 2021 by companies 
(assessing all the participating authorities) and authorities (assessing themselves only) to undertake a gap 
analysis.  
Three sequential concepts  were used to evaluate the implementation/ adherence status using the developed 
questionnaire : 
 
In addition, where there was inadequate implementation or lack of adherence, respondents were asked to 
provide the rationale, including specific evidence and examples.  
It should be noted that for Tier 1 and 2 ICH Guidelines, participants were asked to complete the entire 
questionnaire (assessing Step 1, 2, 3 and the rationale) while for Tier 3, recognising a large workload needed to 
complete the questionnaire for 53 Guidelines, participants were only asked questions related to implementation 
status and adherence status (Step 1 and 3). To provide consistency in the results among Tier 1, 2 and 3, only 
results from Step 1 (implementation) and Step 3 (adherence) are presented in this report. However, the 
complete set of results, including Step 2 for Tier 1 and 2 Guidelines, as well as unaggregated results, were shared 
with the participating organisations and presented to the ICH.

Implementation 
The process of implementation is 
completed. This term refers to the self-
declaration of the regulator regarding 
the conclusion of the implementation 
process. Usually, the regulator 
publishes the final guideline. 
 Question 1 in survey Adequate implementation 
ICH Guideline implemented by 
authority without modifications or 
modifications are justified (do not 
increase regulatory burden) 
 Question 1.2 and 1.2.2 Adherence 
The regulatory authority 
consistently adheres to (applies) all 
identified relevant elements, 
concepts, and principles of the ICH 
Guideline in practice 
 Question 1.3

 The following ICH Guidelines were assessed: 
 Tier 1 (only for ICH Observers)  
o Q1 – Stability (all subparts considered)  
o Q7 – Good Manufacturing Practice Guide for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients  
o E6(R2) – Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
 Tier 2 (only for ICH non-Standing non-Founding Regulatory Members)  
o E2A – Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited. Reporting 
o E2B(R3) – Clinical Safety Data Management: Data Elements for Transmission of Individual Case 
Safety Reports 
o E2D – Post-approval Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited 
Reporting 
o M1 – Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Terminology (MedDRA) 
o M4 – Common Technical Document (CTD) 
 Tier 3 (only for ICH non-Standing non-Founding Regulatory Members)  
o 55 Guidelines were studied, of which 53 were unique Guidelines (where two Guidelines, E9 and 
S5, were included twice as E9 – E9(R1) and S5(R2)-S5(R3)) from across Q, S, E, M domains. All 
ICH Guidelines are listed in Appendix 4

 RESULTS PART 1: ICH REGULATORY MEMBERS (TIER 2 & TIER 3)  
Characteristics of participating companies  
 
Key Messages  
 30 companies participated 
out of 40 invited companies 
(75% response rate) 
 There was a good level of 
experience among the 
participating pharmaceutical 
companies regarding 
implementation of Tier 2 and 
Tier 3 ICH Guidelines by ICH 
non-Standing non-Founding 
Regulatory Members 
 27 out of the 30 participating 
companies had experience 
with at least one authority 
and at least one Guideline 
(Tier 2 or 3). 
Method: Question 1i (see Appendix 1)  
 
Companies’ Experiences with ICH non-Standing non-Founding Regulatory Members : Participating companies 
were asked for their most recent/relevant experience regarding a Guideline for a selected authority.  
 
Key Messages  
 In general, the most 
recent/relevant experiences 
for companies were from a 
past regulatory submission or 
by ongoing regulatory 
intelligence input/local 
affiliate opinion 
 Where companies indicated 
that they had experience 
from a past regulatory 
submission, 91% of them 
were submitted in 2019 or 
later. 
 
 
 
Method: Question 1a (see Appendix 2)   


8 
 Company type: Companies were asked to specify their company type based on the countries/regions where they 
submitted drug applications.  
Key Messages  
 More than 80% of companies 
were global, and this varied 
little according to authority or 
Guideline. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Method: Question 1i (see Appendix 2)   
 
Company Focus:  Companies were also asked to specify their focus for drug development, i.e. innovative and/or 
generic medicines.   
Key Messages  
 90% of surveyed companies 
were innovative companies. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Method: Question 1ii (see Appendix 2)

 RESULTS PART 1.1: TIER 2 GUIDELINES  
Implementation status:  Authorities and companies were asked about their views on the implementation status 
for the selected Tier 2 Guidelines. The first bar in the graph below corresponds to the self-declaration by the 
authorities (aggregated results across the six ICH non-Standing non-Founding Regulatory Members), and the 
second bar shows the number of responses across the companies. The ICH Guidelines were firstly ordered in 
descending order based on the percentage of answers that authorities marked as ‘Implemented’ in question 1, 
and secondly based on the responses from companies. 
Key Messages 
 Most of the Guidelines were 
seen as implemented or in the 
process of implementation  
 Company perception of 
implementation status was 
generally aligned with agency 
self-declaration 
 E2A, E2D and M4 had the 
highest proportion of 
‘implemented’ responses  
 For E2B(R3) and M1, the 
response was mixed between 
‘implemented’ and ‘in the 
process of implementation’. 
Method: Question 1 (See Appendix 2)   
 
Adherence status: Organisations that confirmed that a Tier 2 Guideline had been adequately implemented 
(unmodified or modified with justification) were asked to provide views on the adherence status. Adherence 
relates to whether, in practice, the authority applies all identified relevant elements, concepts, and principles of 
the ICH Guideline over time. The ICH Guidelines were firstly ordered in descending order based on the 
percentage of answers that authorities marked as ‘adherence’ in question 1.3, and secondly based on the 
responses from companies. 
Key Messages  
 Where implementation was 
confirmed, the perceived 
level of adherence to the 
Guidelines was high or too 
early to assess, particularly for 
E2B(R3) Guideline 
 In general, company 
perception and agency self-
declaration was aligned.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Method: Question 1.3 (See Appendix 2)   


10 
 Rationale for lack of adherence: The graph below outlines the rationale for selecting a “lack of adherence” 
response for selected Guidelines.  
 
Method: Question 2 (See Appendix 2) 
Key Messages 
 As no authorities declared ‘lack of adherence’ response for Tier 2 Guidelines, the results below only show 
rationale from companies, aggregated across all the authorities studied 
 However, it should be noted that the number of companies that perceived lack of adherence, and 
subsequently provided the rationale, was low (three, five and eleven companies for E2A, E2D and M4 
Guidelines, respectively) 
 The most common reasons among E2A, E2D and M4 Guidelines based on company perception was that 
authorities incorporate additional requirements or apply them inconsistently 
 M4 Guideline received the largest number of responses with varied reasons for lack of adherence. 
  


11 
 Comparison to 2019 Survey Results1 
The following graphs compare the 20191 and 2021 surveys’ results regarding implementation and adherence of 
Tier 2 Guidelines from included ICH non-Standing non-Founding Regulatory Members (except for TITCK, Turkey, 
who was an Observer at the time)  
Key Messages for implementation 
progress 
• In only two years, the number 
of authorities that declared 
implementation of E2B(R3) 
Guideline have increased by 
three 
• The implementation of E2D, 
M4, and M1 Guidelines have 
progressed in one authority 
compared with 2019 results 
• In general, based on the 
industry perception, there 
was also an increased level of 
Guideline implementation by 
the authorities compared to 
two years ago. 
 
Key Messages for adherence 
progress 
• Where implementation was 
confirmed, the perceived 
level of adherence to the 
Guidelines was high 
• There was an increase in 
adherence based on the 
authorities’ declaration and 
industry perception, 
compared to the 2019 study 
e.g. for E2D  
• For a number of Guidelines 
and authorities where 
implementation occurred 
recently, it was too early to 
assess adherence e.g. 
E2B(R3).

12 
 RESULTS  PART 1.2: TIER 3 GUIDELINES  
Implementation status:  Authorities and companies were asked about their views on the implementation status 
for the selected Tier 3 Guidelines. The first bar in the graph below corresponds to the self-declaration by the 
authorities (aggregated results across the six ICH non-Standing non-Founding Regulatory Members), and the 
second bar shows the number of responses across the companies. The ICH Guidelines were firstly ordered in 
descending order based on the percentage of answers that authorities marked as ‘Implemented’ in question 1, 
and secondly based on the responses from companies. 
Key Messages for Quality Guidelines 
 Generally, the self-declaration of the ICH Regulatory Members on the implementation of the Quality ICH 
Guidelines was aligned with companies’ implementation perceptions 
 The aggregated results demonstrate that, in general, the Guidelines were perceived as implemented 
 A number of the Guidelines, particularly Q12, are still seen to be in the process of being implemented or not 
implemented.  
Method: Question 1 (See Appendix 2) 


13 
 Key Messages for Safety Guidelines  
 The aggregated results across the stakeholders demonstrate that, in general, the Safety Guidelines were 
perceived as implemented  
 A few of the Guidelines, particularly S11 and S5(R3), are still seen to be in the process of being implemented 
or not implemented. 
 
Method: Question 1 (See Appendix 2) 
  


14 
 Key Messages for Efficacy Guidelines 
 Most of the Efficacy Guidelines were perceived by companies and self-declared by authorities as 
implemented  
 A number of the Guidelines, particularly E9(R1), are seen to be in the process of being implemented or not 
implemented. 
 
Method: Question 1 (See Appendix 2) 
  


15 
 Key Messages for Multidisciplinary 
Guidelines  
 M7(R1) and M3(R2) Guidelines 
were considered as 
implemented by the majority 
of companies and declared by 
authorities 
 M9 Guideline was considered 
as mainly in the process of 
implementation. 
 
 
 
 
Method: Question 1 (See Appendix 2)   
 
  


16 
 Adherence status: Organisations were asked to provide views on the adherence status. Adherence relates to 
whether, in practice, the authority applies all identified relevant elements, concepts, and principles of the ICH 
Guideline over time. The ICH Guidelines were firstly ordered in descending order based on the percentage of 
answers that authorities marked as ‘adherence’ in question 1.3, and secondly based on the responses from 
companies.  
 
Key Messages for Quality Guidelines 
 For those Quality ICH Guidelines that were confirmed as implemented, there was generally a strong level of 
adherence based on agency self-declaration and company perception 
 For Q12, no responses were received from authorities regarding adherence status, as no authority declared 
it as implemented (see page 12) however, four authorities confirmed they are in the process of 
Implementing. 
 
Method: Question 1.3 (See Appendix 2)   
  


17 
 Key Messages for Safety Guidelines 
 Based on the companies and authorities’ responses, there was a good level of adherence to the 
implemented Safety Guidelines  
 For S5(R3), no responses were received from authorities regarding adherence status, as no authority 
declared it as implemented (see page 13) however, three authorities confirmed they are in the process of 
Implementing. 
 
Method: Question 1.3 (See Appendix 2)   


18 
 Key Messages for Efficacy Guidelines  
 Based on agencies self-declaration and companies’ perception, in general Efficacy Guidelines were seen as 
adhered to by most of the authorities  
 For E9(R1), no responses were received from authorities regarding adherence status, as no authority 
declared it as implemented (see page 14) however three authorities confirmed they are in the process of 
Implementing. 
 
Method: Question 1.3 (See Appendix 2) 
  


19 
 Key Messages for Multidisciplinary 
Guidelines 
 Based on agencies self-
declaration, there was 
adherence to M3(R2) and 
M7(R1) Guidelines by three 
out of the six authorities; this 
was generally consistent with 
the industry perception. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Method: Question 1.3 (See Appendix 2) 
 
  


20 
 RESULTS  PART 2: ICH REGULATORY OBSERVERS (TIER 1) 
General overview of participating companies 
Key Messages  
 The majority of 
participating companies 
had experiences across 
the studied ICH Observers. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Method: Question 1i (see Appendix 2)   
 
Companies’ Experiences with ICH Observers: Participating companies were asked for their most recent/relevant 
experience regarding a Guideline for a selected authority.  
Key Messages  
 The most recent/relevant 
experience from companies 
regarding the studied ICH 
Observers were from a past 
regulatory submission 
 Where companies indicated 
that they had experience 
from a past regulatory 
submission, 93% of them 
were submitted in 2019 or 
later. 
 
 
 
Method: Question 1a (see Appendix 2)   
 
 
 
 
  


21 
 Company type: Companies were asked to specify their company type based on the countries/regions where they 
submitted drug applications.  
Key Messages  
 More than 80% of companies 
were global, and this was 
consistent across the 
different authorities.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Method: Question 1i (see Appendix 2)   
 
Company Focus:  Companies were also asked to specify their focus for drug development, i.e. innovative and/or 
generic medicines.   
Key Messages  
 Approximately 80% of 
companies are focused on 
innovative medicines. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Method: Question 1ii (see Appendix 2) 
 
 
 
 
 


22 
 Implementation status:  Authorities and companies were asked about their views on the Tier 1 Guidelines’ 
implementation status. The first bar in the graph below corresponds to the self-declaration by the authorities 
(aggregated results across the six ICH Observers), and the second bar shows the number of responses across the 
companies. The ICH Guidelines were firstly ordered in descending order based on the percentage of answers 
that authorities marked as ‘Implemented’ in question 1, and secondly based the responses from companies. 
Key Messages   
 E6(R2), Q7 and Q1 Guidelines 
were declared as implemented 
by three of the authorities; this 
was generally aligned with the 
views of the industry  
 Q1 Guideline was declared as 
implemented by two 
authorities while it is in the 
process of implementation by 
other two 
 
 
 
 
 
Method: Question 1 (See Appendix 2)  
 
Adherence status: Organisations that confirmed that a Guideline had been adequately implemented (unmodified 
or modified with justification) were asked to provide views on the adherence status. Adherence relates to 
whether, in practice, the authority applies all identified relevant elements, concepts and principles of the ICH 
Guideline over time. The ICH Guidelines were firstly ordered in descending order based on the percentage of 
answers that authorities marked as ‘adherence’ in question 1.3, and secondly based on the responses from 
companies.  
Key Messages  
 For those Guidelines that were 
implemented, there was 
generally a strong level of 
adherence. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Method: Question 1.3 (See Appendix 2)   
 


23 
 Rationale for lack of adherence: The graph below outlines the rationale for selecting a “lack of adherence” 
response for selected Guidelines.  
Key Messages  
• As no authorities declared ‘lack of adherence’ response for Tier 1 Guidelines, the results below only 
show rationale from companies, aggregated across all the authorities studied 
• However, it should be noted that the number of companies that perceived that there is a lack of 
adherence, and subsequently provided the rationale, was low (three companies for Q1 and Q7 only) 
• The most mentioned rationale for lack of adherence was that other local guidelines conflict with the 
Guideline and prevent full adherence to the ICH Guideline.

 RESULTS  PART 3.2: ADHERENCE STATUS 
Aiming to compare and find agreement among authorities’ self-declaration and companies’ perception, an 
assessment was undertaken to summarise the consensus adherence status of the ICH Guidelines among the 
authorities for all Tiers. The following tables show the result of this assessment, and the method used for 
developing it is described in Appendix 3.  
A. Adherence to Tier 2 Guidelines by ICH Regulatory Members  
Note: Each column does not add up to 100% because there was no consensus response for some Guidelines/authorities, or 
Guidelines were not implemented by the authority           Method: Question 1.3 (See Appendix 2 and Appendix 3)   
Key Messages 
 E2D and M4 Guidelines were considered as adhered to, in addition to being implemented, by five of the 
authorities based on agreement between authority self-declaration and the majority industry perception 
 E2A Guideline was considered as adhered to by four authorities 
 Where there was no adherence this was largely due to the fact that implementation occurred recently and 
it is too early to assess adherence i.e. E2D, M4 and E2B(R3) for one authority each. 
 
B. Adherence to Tier 3 Guidelines by ICH Regulatory Members  
 
Key Messages for  adherence of Tier 3 Guidelines by ICH Regulatory Members  
 Across all six Regulatory Members, adherence to the Tier 3 Guidelines ranged from 2%-92%; where 
adherence was low, this was due to the Guideline being not implemented or only recently  
 Three out of the six Regulatory Members adhered to >70% of the Tier 3 Guidelines (data not shown but was 
shared with participants). The results for the Tier 3 Guidelines were organised below according to the topic:

 CONCLUSION 
The results of Phase 2b project show evidence of a strong level of implementation and adherence to the ICH 
Guidelines by the participating 6 ICH non-Standing non-Founding Regulatory Members and the 4 ICH Observers 
with a good alignment between the perception of the participating 30 pharmaceutical companies and the self-
declaration from the assessed authorities.  
ICH non-Standing non-Founding Regulatory Members:  Tier 2 Guidelines were implemented and adhered to by 
most of the ICH non-Standing non-Founding Regulatory Members. By comparing results from 2019, in general, 
the guideline implementation increased in the last two years. For Tier 3 Guidelines there is evidence that most 
of the Guidelines in this Tier are implemented and adhered to by the authorities, or that they are in the process 
of implementation 
ICH Observers - Tier 1 Guidelines: Results showed that two ICH Observers implemented and adhered to all Tier 
1 Guidelines. 
Overall, the results demonstrate authorities’ and companies’ continued commitment and support in ICH’s mission 
to achieve greater harmonisation worldwide and ensure that safe, effective, and high-quality medicines are 
developed, registered, and maintained in the most resource-efficient manner whilst meeting high standards.  
These could be used to support decisions related to ICH membership applications, the transparent communication 
of Guideline implementation status, and more targeted approaches to ICH training activity, as well as future 
revisions of ICH Guidelines.

 APPENDIX 1 – DEFINITIONS OF TERMS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION AND 
ADHERENCE OF ICH GUIDELINES 
Term Definition  Comments  
Not (yet) implemented The process for the 
implementation of an ICH 
Guideline has not yet started. a) No guideline exists or b) national/ regional 
Guideline deviating from ICH Guideline or 
national/regional Guideline exists but the process for 
replacement or amendments for alignment with the 
ICH Guideline has not started yet.  
In the process of 
implementation The process for the 
implementation of the ICH 
Guideline has started and has 
reached a specified milestone. 
The process is monitored by 
the regulatory agency and the 
progress is reported to the ICH 
MC/Assembly on a regular 
basis.  The process can have different starting points: a) no 
national/regional guideline exists; the ICH Guideline 
defines new requirements and b) a national/regional 
guideline is in the process of development or c) a 
national/regional guideline exists and is replaced by 
or is amended to be in line with the ICH Guideline. 
Generic processes for a) non-electronic and b) 
electronic guidelines will be defined outlining the 
milestones that should be followed. 
Implemented The process of implementation 
is completed. This step is 
identical to step 5 of the ICH 
process. This term refers to the self-declaration of the 
regulator regarding the conclusion of the 
implementation process. Usually, the regulator 
publishes the final Guideline.  
Adequately 
implemented All relevant elements, concepts 
and principles of the ICH 
Guideline are followed. This is 
done preferably by referring 
to/implementing the original 
ICH Guideline text and/or 
translating the original 
Guideline text. This may 
include in justified cases 
implementation of the 
Guideline in a way that may 
incorporate additional 
information beyond those 
defined in the ICH Guideline in 
circumstances when the 
Guideline is too high-level and 
does not provide sufficient 
guidance.  
 Minimal elements, concepts and principles will be 
defined and included in the survey to assess the 
degree of implementation. Additional information to 
the ICH Guideline should only be included in order to 
provide clarity and facilitate implementation by 
industry, but should not increase regulatory burden. 
Deviations or additional information to help clarify 
concepts should be communicated (with the 
justification) to the ICH Management Committee for 
transparency and possibly assessment. 
Not adequately 
implemented The ICH Guideline has been 
implemented in a modified 
way that a) incorporates 
additional requirements 
beyond those defined in the 
ICH Guideline without Lack of adequate implementation means that the ICH 
Guideline has not been adequately implemented 
following an assessment of the regulatory or 
administrative measure that incorporates the ICH 
Guideline into the regulatory framework.  

31 
 Term Definition  Comments  
objective justification in cases 
where clear guidance is 
provided, or b) does not 
include all relevant elements, 
concepts and principles of the 
ICH Guideline and does not 
provide any objective 
justification for omitting some 
requirements in the Guideline 
or c) requires application of the 
Guideline for a smaller range of 
products than outlined in the 
ICH Guideline.  There may be varying degrees of inadequate 
implementation and this assessment can only be 
done on a case-by-case basis. Examples could be 
taken from the Industry Survey to illustrate this 
range. It should be noted that according to the 
Assembly RoP (v. 4.0), deviation from the Guideline, 
in exceptional cases, may be accepted if objectively 
justified. 
Adherence1 In its practice, the regulatory 
authority consistently adheres 
to (applies) all identified 
relevant elements, concepts 
and principles of the ICH 
Guideline over time. Once an ICH Guideline has been (adequately) 
implemented by a regulatory authority, experience is 
gathered on how the regulator applies the Guideline 
in practice. Adherence leads to a stable regulatory 
environment and to increased sustainability. 
Adherence may be assessed in regular intervals.  
Lack of adherence Even if the Guideline has been 
adequately implemented, it is 
not being applied and adhered 
to in practice.  The regulatory authority does not in practice require 
industry to adhere to the Guideline or does not follow 
the Guideline when assessing the applications; e.g. is 
in its practice adding requirements beyond what is 
provided in the (implemented) ICH Guideline. 
Confirmed 
implementation/ 
adherence Both the implementation of 
and adherence to the ICH 
Guideline have been assessed 
by an independent third party 
and have been found to be 
adequate by the Assembly/the 
MC (see above). The assessment should be done in two-steps: first 
assessment of a) adequate implementation and then 
b) adherence to the ICH Guideline. 
The implementation should not be considered 
confirmed even in case of adherence if there is no 
adequate implementation of the ICH Guideline (i.e. 
where the regulatory authority in practice accepts 
submissions that comply with the requirements in 
the ICH Guideline despite not having adequately 
implemented it).  
Not applicable The implementation of a 
specific ICH Guideline is not 
applicable in a country/region. 
An appropriate justification is 
provided. Example: A country may not have its own 
Pharmacopeia but references internationally 
recognised Pharmacopoeias. Hence, the ICH Q4B 
Guideline is not applicable (and does not need to be 
implemented). 
02 October 2018 Definitions v 1.1 
                                                                    
1 Adherence at this point in time is defined as application of the ICH Guideline by the regulator’s view. At a later 
stage, consideration will be given to the aspect of adherence to the Guideline requirements by industry’s view.

 APPENDIX 2 – Study TOOL  
 
Questionnaire  
This document outlines the questions that will be listed as part of the online data collection tool (DCT).  
 
The below questions will be used for each Guideline and authority for respondents from both companies and 
authorities (note that where specified, certain questions are applicable to companies only).  
 
Companies will have to answer the following general questions:  
Question 1i (Companies only): Please specify your company type, which refers to what countries/regions the 
company is submitting drug applications to:  
 Local country only  
 Single region  
 Multi-regional  
 Global  
 
Question 1ii (Companies only): Please specify your company’s focus for drug development:  
 Innovative medicines  
 Generic medicines  
 Both  
 
All questions will be available for Tier 1 and Tier 2 Guidelines whereas Tier 3 Guidelines, an abbreviated 
questionnaire will be utilised based on questions highlighted in gray.  
 
Question 1a (for Companies only)  
What is your company’s experience in regard to this Guideline for the selected authority? Select one (most 
recent and relevant). (Additional text to display as ‘hover box’ for company’s experience: “Please specify your 
company’s experience relating to the Guideline/authority before answering Questions 2-4. If ‘no experience’ 
selected, scroll down to Question 3. If multiple options apply, select one that is most relevant, noting that 
responses in the subsequent Questions 2-4 should relate to your company’s general experience, and not only 
to the single submission/experience selected. Additional comments and/or divergences can be captured 
through comment boxes, for example Question 3.”)  
 From a past regulatory submission  
 
1.1.a. If yes, give a year of the most recent submission Text box ‘yyyy’ format  
 Through ongoing regulatory intelligence input/local affiliate opinion  
 Being used to prepare for an upcoming submission  
 Through interactions and exchanges with the authority  
 No experience  
 
If ‘no experience’, respondent redirected to Question 3. If other responses selected, respondent asked to answer 
Question 1.  
 
 
 
Question 1 (for companies and authorities)  
1.1. Please provide your organisation’s view on the implementation status for the selected Guideline. Select one.

for replacement or amendments for alignment with the ICH Guideline has not started yet.”)  
 In the process of implementation - The process for the implementation of the ICH Guideline has started 
and has reached a specified milestone. (Additional text to display as a ‘hover box’ for ‘in the process of 
implementation’: “The process can have different starting points: a) no national/regional guideline 
exists; the ICH Guideline defines new requirements and b) a national/regional guideline is in the process 
of development or c) a national/regional guideline exists and is replaced by or is amended to be in line 
with the ICH Guideline. Generic processes for a) non-electronic and b) electronic guidelines will be 
defined outlining the milestones that should be followed.”)  
 Implemented - The process of implementation is completed. (Additional text to display as a ‘hover box’ 
based for ‘implemented’: “This term refers to the self-declaration of the regulator regarding the 
conclusion of the implementation process. Usually, the regulator publishes the final Guideline. This 
could relate to both adequate or inadequate implementation of the Guideline. The adequacy of 
implementation will be queried in the next question.”)  
 Not Applicable - The implementation of a specific ICH Guideline is not applicable in this country/region. 
An appropriate justification is provided. (Additional text to display as a ‘hover box’ for ‘not applicable’: 
“Example: A country may not have its own Pharmacopeia but references internationally recognised 
Pharmacopoeias. Hence, the ICH Q4B Guideline is not applicable (and does not need to be 
implemented).”)  
 
If ‘Not applicable’ selected in Question 1.1, respondent redirected to Question 1.1.1, and then Question 3. If ‘not 
implemented’ or ‘in the process of implementation’ selected in Question 1.1, respondent redirected to Question 
3. If ‘implemented’, respondent asked to answer Question 1.2.  
 
1.1.1 If ‘not applicable’, please comment  
(Free text comment); 
 
1.2. Please indicate which statement best characterises your organisation’s view of the implementation of the 
ICH Guideline? Select one.  
 
 An unmodified ICH Guideline has been implemented, where all relevant elements, concepts and 
principles of the ICH Guideline are followed. This is done preferably by referring to/implementing the 
original ICH Guideline text and/or translating the original guideline text.  
 Some modifications have been made to the original ICH Guideline either by adding or altering certain 
elements, concepts or principles  
If ‘An unmodified ICH…’ to Question 1.2, respondent redirected to Question 1.3.  
If ‘Some modification’ to Question 1.2, respondent redirected to 1.2.1  
 
1.2.1. Please specify what modifications were made (either by indicating the section of the Guideline, inserting 
the wording or outlining the area concerned).  
 (Free text comment);  
 
1.2.2. Are these modifications objectively justified by the authority? (Additional text to display as a ‘hover box’ 
for ‘objectively justified’: “This may include in justified cases implementation of the Guideline in a way that may 
incorporate additional information beyond those defined in the ICH Guideline in circumstances when the 

34 
 Guideline is too high-level and does not provide sufficient guidance. Additional information to the ICH Guideline 
should only be included in order to provide clarity and facilitate implementation by industry, but should not 
increase regulatory burden.”)  
 Yes  
 No  
If ‘No’ to Question 1.2.2, respondent redirected to Question 2.  
If ‘Yes’ to Question 1.2.2, respondent asked to answer Question 1.3 (i.e. only if Guideline is ‘adequately’ 
implemented will the respondent answer the question on adherence)  
 
 
1.3. Please provide your organisation’s view on the adherence status for the selected Guideline? Select one.  
 In its practice, the regulatory authority consistently adheres to (applies) all identified relevant elements, 
concepts and principles of the ICH Guideline over time (Additional text to display as a ‘hover box’ for 
‘consistently adheres (applies) ‘: “Once an ICH Guideline has been (adequately) implemented by a 
regulatory authority, experience is gathered on how the regulator applies the Guideline in practice. 
Adherence leads to a stable regulatory environment and to increased sustainability. Adherence may be 
assessed in regular intervals.”)  
 Even if the Guideline has been adequately implemented, it is not being applied and adhered to in 
practice (Additional text to display as a ‘hover box’ for ‘not being applied and adhered to ‘: “The 
regulatory authority does not in practice require industry to adhere to the Guideline or does not follow 
the Guideline when assessing the applications; e.g. is in its practice adding requirements beyond what 
is provided in the (implemented) ICH Guideline.”)  
 The regulatory authority has only recently implemented the Guideline therefore it is too early to assess 
the adherence to the Guideline due to limited experience  
 
If ‘Even if the Guideline has been adequately implemented, it is not being applied and adhered (…)’ to Question 
1.3, respondent asked to answer Question 2. Otherwise respondents redirected to Question 3.  
 
Question 2 (for companies and authorities)  
2.1. Please provide the rationale for your selection by specifying the appropriate root cause(s) listed below. 
Select all that apply.  
If ‘not adequately implemented’ is specified in Question 1.2, the following will be displayed:  
 Incorporates additional requirements beyond those defined in the ICH Guideline without objective 
justification in cases where clear guidance is provided  
 Does not include all relevant elements, concepts and principles of the ICH Guideline and does not 
provide any objective justification for omitting some requirements in the Guideline  
 Requires application of the Guideline for a smaller range of products than outlined in the ICH Guideline  
 Other  
 
If ‘other’, please specify  
(free text comment)  
If ‘lack of adherence’ is specified in Question 1.3, the above will be displayed, as well as the below (i.e. all 9 
options) 
 
 Other local guidelines conflict with the ICH Guideline and prevent full adherence to the Guideline  
 Agency process or capacity issues (agency does not have an internal process and/or resources to 
implement the Guideline)  
 There is a general lack of understanding of the elements of the ICH Guideline by technical reviewers 
(the underlying regulatory science is not understood)  

35 
  Inconsistent application of the Guideline; e.g. adherence and interpretation varies by 
submission/review division/reviewer  
 The agency does not in practice require industry to adhere to the Guideline  
 
2.2 Please provide specific evidence or examples that substantiate your root cause choice(s), (OPTIONAL)

 APPENDIX 3 – METHOD OF ANALYSIS  
Summary – Implementation status’ Method 
 
To consider that a Guideline was implemented in a specific agency, the answers to Question 1 were analysed 
using the following inclusion criteria: 
1. The Guideline should be considered as implemented by at least 60% of the companies that responded 
to Question 1 
2. At least three companies are in consensus 
3. The regulatory agency declared that the Guideline was implemented 
Once the Guidelines were categorised as implemented for each authority, the % of authorities where the 
Guideline was implemented, was calculated  dividing the number of authorities with Guideline implemented by 
the authorities’ total number 
 
Summary – Adherence status’ Method   
 
An assessment utilising the following three categories was undertaken to summarise the implementation and 
adherence status of the agency for the Guidelines assessed 
 
Category 1: Guideline 
implemented AND  
adhered to Category 2a: Guideline 
implemented BUT no adherence Category 2b: Guideline 
implemented BUT too early to 
assess adherence 
 
The method is as follows: 
• Implementation: For both categories 1, 2a and 2b the first criterion is that the response to Question 1 
on implementation was ‘implemented’ for BOTH the authority and based on a majority response from 
all companies (here assumed as >60% responses e.g. 6/10 companies)  
• Adherence: The difference in categories is response to Question 1.3 on adherence, where: 
• Category 1: both authority and company majority response (>60%) is ‘adherence’ 
• Category 2a and 2b: a number of combinations are possible (see table below): 
 
  Company majority response to Question 1.3 (>%60)  
  Adherence No adherence Too early to assess 
Authority response to 
Question 1.3 Adherence  Category 1 Category 2a Category 2b 
No adherence  Category 2a Category 2a Category 2b 
Too early to assess Category 2b Category 2b Category 2b 
NOTE: number of companies stating ‘implemented’ AND ‘adherence’ must be ≥ 3 to be included in analysis 
 
Once the Guidelines were categorised based on their adherence status, the % of authorities where the Guideline 
was adhered to  was calculated with the number of authorities that have adhered the Guideline divided by total 
number of authorities
