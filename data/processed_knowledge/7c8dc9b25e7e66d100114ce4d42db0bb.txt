Patient Portal oopus oomniaDrug development often misses the mark because it 
overlooks the most important voice: the patient’s. Timelines 
stretch. Trials stall. Treatments fail to deliver . At Wemedoo, 
we ﬁx that.
We bring patients into the development process using 
structured tools and clean data pipelines. Our approach 
helps research teams focus on real needs, improve study 
design, streamline recruitment, and strengthen regulatory 
and market outcomes.
Wemedoo delivers modular tools and expert services that support patient-centered R&D:

Wemedoo is scaling. Our roadmap includes:
We have built the infrastructure. We have the 
expertise. We are aligned with where the 
industry is going: faster , smarter , patient-ﬁrst 
development.Wemedoo directly addresses ineﬃciencies in 
the pharmaceutical value chain, from trial 
failure to slow approvals to weak uptake.
We help deﬁne unmet clinical needs by engaging directly with 
patients and caregivers. Our tools uncover insights into disease 
burden and support the identiﬁcation of promising therapeutic 
targets early in the development cycle.Research & Discovery
We capture patient preferences regarding drug delivery methods 
to inform the study design. This helps evaluate the likely impact 
on adherence and deﬁne meaningful endpoints that matter to 
the people who will use the drug.Preclinical Development
Our approach supports patient-centered trial design. We work to 
deﬁne patient-driven endpoints, diversify recruitment 
populations, and identify the most suitable regions and trial sites 
using real-world input and regional analytics.Clinical Development
We facilitate patient involvement throughout the regulatory 
process. This includes preparing patient testimonies for hearings, 
gathering preference data, organizing patient-focused 
development meetings, and involving patient representatives on 
advisory committees.Regulatory Approval
We help integrate patient experience into communication 
strategies. This includes real stories and testimonials, pricing 
models that reﬂect patient aﬀordability concerns, and 
educational materials developed with patient understanding in 
mind.Marketing & Sales
We continue gathering patient feedback after launch. 
Testimonials, aﬀordability concerns, and lived experiences help 
reﬁne messaging, support ongoing education, and improve 
long-term treatment adherence and access.Post-Marketing ActivitiesData value chain in

Technical Framework for
Patient Data Flow and Decision Support
1 2 3 4 5
Conversational agents and LLMs handle 
ﬁrst-line screening of patient eligibility. If 
criteria are met, a human (study nurse) 
takes over for onboarding and further 
processing.Techniques can be applied to evaluate 
how professionals make decisions. Patient 
perspectives and choices may be 
compared with professional 
decision-making mechanisms.The system connects to hospital EHRs 
to extract and structure data 
automatically, extending functionality 
for smoother interoperability and data 
ﬂow.

Acts as a continuous data collection 
system within hospitals, supports 
registries and quality assurance eﬀorts to 
monitor and improve care delivery.

Analysis & Comparison
We bring deep expertise and smart technology to unlock the full potential of clinical data, advancing 
patient-ﬁrst, eﬃcient research. We seamlessly connect people, processes, and data to drive real impact 
across the clinical landscape.Patients upload scans or images of their 
medical records. These are automatically 
structured and aligned with ideal clinical 
pathways for streamlined analysis and 
integration.
