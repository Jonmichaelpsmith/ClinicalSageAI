METHODS
Study Design:   This double -blind, randomized study  compared the efficacy  and safet y of 
voriconazole and anidulafungin in combination to voriconazole alone in alloge neic HSCT 
recipients and subjects with hematologic malignancies with proven or probable IA.  Subjects 
with possible I A were enrolled in the study .  However, these subjects were required to have a 
proven or probable diagnosis established within 7 day s of en rollment.   Subjects were 
stratified at study  entry  for host and transplant variables known to have an independent 
impact on the probability of death due to IA; these included: 1) allogeneic HSCT versus 
other; and 2) pulmonary  IA versus other.   
Subjects were to receive a total of 6 weeks of therapy .  Subjects were randomized to 1 of 
2treatment arms: voriconazole and placebo for anidulafungin or voriconazole and active 
anidulafungin.  After 2 weeks, the Investigator had the option of either continuing the 
subject’s initial treatment regimen or switching the subject to voriconazole monotherap y.  
Subjects who were switched to voriconazole monotherap y had to demonstrate improvement 
in presenting clinical signs and sy mptoms and stable or improved radiographic re sponse.  For 
the final 2 weeks of treatment, all subjects received voriconazole monotherapy .
Voriconazole was to be administered in the intravenous (IV)formulation for the first week of 
therap y.  Subsequentl y, subjects could be switched between IV and ora l voricon azole at the 
discretion of the I nvestigator.  Anidulafungin and anidulafungin placebo were administered 
IV.
Assessments of response to treatment were performed every  2 weeks during the study . 
Outcomes were assessed after 6 weeks of antifungal the rapy.  All -cause mortality  was also 
assessed at the 12 -week time point.  The comparative design enabled evaluation of efficacy , 
safet y, and tolerability of the combination regimen in a blinded, unbiased fashion.   The 
schedule of study  activities is present ed in Table 1.

Template version 1.0 Page 5Number of Subjects (Planned and Analyzed):   A total of 405 subjects were planned to be 
enrolled to achieve a sample size of 250 evaluable subjects (125 per arm) completing the 
study .  A total of 481 sub jects were screened for participation in the study ,of which 
459subjects were randomized to receive stud y treatment .  A total of 454 subjects were 
treated and anal yzed.
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion:   Male and female subjects aged16years and
older who were in immunocompromised state due to either receipt of hematopoeitic stem cell 
transplantation or hematologic malignancy  and who had been diagnos edwith proven , 
probable, or p ossible IA.
Study Treatment:   Voriconazole, which was administered o pen-label, was supplied by  local 
sites or by  the study  sponsor.  Anidulafungin (l yophilized) and its companion diluents were 
supplied by  the study  sponsor and administered in a blin ded manner.   Subjects randomized to 
receive placebo for anidulafungin were infused IV with the contents of a stock infusion bag 
or bottle provided b y each site .
Overall, subjects received 6 weeks of antifungal therap y.  During the first 2 weeks of therapy , 
subjects randomized to the combination treatment group received voriconazo le and 
anidulafungin.  The dose for anidulafungin for all subjects was 200 mg IV on Day 1, 
followed b y 100 mg IV once dail y (QD) thereafter.  Anidulafungin and placebo for 
anidulafungin were administered IV.   During the first 2 weeks of therapy , subjects 
randomized to the voriconazole treatment group received voriconazole and placebo for 
anidulafungin.  The placebo for anidulafungin was administered QD during the initial 2 -week 
treatment period.
All subjects received IV or oral voriconazole and were treated with an initial loading dose 
and a subsequent maintenance dose based on body weight .  IV voriconazole (200mg IV 
infusion/vial) was required for all subjects during the first week of therap y.  Subjects could 
subsequently  switch to oral voriconazole (40mg/mL suspension or 50 mg and 200 mg 
tablets), at the discretion of the Investigator after the first week.  For subjects with estimated 
creatinine clearance <50 mL /minute, oral voriconazole was recommended after the initial 
1-week treatment with IV voriconaz ole.
During the final 2 weeks of treatment, all subjects received maintenance voriconazole 
monotherap y.
Anidulafungin and anidulafungin placebo were to be administered within 2 hours before or 
after the scheduled administration time. Voriconazole was to b e administered within 1 hour 
before or after the scheduled administration time.   IV infusions of anidulafungin and 
voriconazole were administered sequentiall y.

Safety Evaluations:   Safety  evaluations included adverse events (AEs), laboratory  
evaluations, and ophthalmological assessments.
Statistical Methods:   The modified intent -to-treat (MITT) population was defined to be the 
set of all randomiz ed subjects with proven or probable IA confirmed b y Day 7 following 
enrollment, who had received at least 1 dose of study  medication.   The MITT population was 
the primary  efficacy  analy sis population.  The ITT and Per -Protocol (PP) populations were 
used in additional supportive anal yses of efficacy .
The ITT anal ysis set consisted of the subjects in the MITT analy sis set plus subjects with 
possible I A who could not be upgraded to probable or proven IA within 7 days and who had 
received at least 1 dose of stu dy medication.   The PP analy sis set consisted of the subjects in 
the MI TT population who had completed at least 2 weeks of study  therapy, and it excluded 
those subjects with protocol violations that could have had an i mpact on the efficacy  
endpoints .  Subj ects who died within 2 weeks of starting on stud y therap y were included in 
the PP analy sis set.
The primary  efficacy  endpoint was calculated using the Kaplan -Meier (KM) product limit 
estimator on Day  42 (6 weeks) within each stratum and weighted by  the har monic mean of 
the sample sizes in the strata .  Time to death (T) was measured from the first dose of study  
medication in day s, where T = (date of death –first treatment date + 1).
For secondary  endpoints, rate of global response, defined as the number of subjects with a 
successful response (“complete” or “partial” global response as adjudicated by  the d ata 
review committee [DRC]) , was calculated as a percentage of all subjects (including subjects 
with “missing” response), at 6 weeks.   Investigators also re corded a global response.   Global 
response was programmatically  determined as follows:
Success: Asubject who achieved a “complete” or “partial” global response was categorized 
as a successful response;  Failure: Asubject was categorized as an unsuccess ful response if

radiological failure.
All-cause mortalit y at 6 weeks in subjects with possible, probable, or proven IA, was 
calculated using the KM product lim it estimat or at Day  42 (Week 6) .  All-cause mortality  at 
12 weeks in subjects with probable or proven IA , was calculated using the KM product limi t 
estimator at Day  84 (Week 12).  Mortality  due to IA at 6 weeks in subjects with probable or 
proven IA :  Cause of death for this analy sis was determined by  the DRC.  Subjects who died 
for causes other than IA before 6 weeks were censored at their time of death in this analy sis.  
The mortality  rates were calculated using the KM product limi t estimator at Day 42 
(Week 6).  Time to death due to IA:  Cause of death for this analy sis was determined by  the 
DRC.  Subjects who died for causes other than IA were defined as censored at time of death.
The anal ysis of time -to-event endpoints was performed using the Cox proportional haz ards 
model to calculate a meaningful summary  parameter (hazard ratio).  The model included 
terms for treatment group and randomization stratum.
The safet y analysis set consisted of randomized subjects who took at least 1 dose of study  
medication.   No forma l statistical analy ses were planned for safet y data.  The safet y 
endpoints were listed and summarized using descriptive statistics.

AE = adverse event; MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ; SAE = serious adverse event.
a.SAEs were reported in the safety database for 13 additional subjects due to the following reasons:  event 
occurred prior to the administration of study drug; event occurred after the administration of study dr ug was 
completed, which was within the reporting period for an SAE, but outside the reporting period for an AE; or 
subject w as randomized but did not receive study drug.

d.Includes only those AEs assessed by Investigator to be causally related to anidulafungin treatment.  
Causal ity assessments were made by Investigators in a blinded manner without knowledge of treatment group;

No subjects permanently  discontinued from the study  due to AEs .
Thirty -five subjects in the voricona zole/anidulafungin group and 20 subjects in the 
voriconazole/placebo group had dose reductions or temporaril y disconti nued the study  due t o 
AEs.  The majorit y of AEs leading to dose reductions or temporary discontinuations were 
moderate in severity  and resolved .
Median changes from baseline in laboratory  parameters were generall y minimal and similar 
between treatment grou ps.
The majority  of subjects had no visual acuit y changes, changes in visual s ymptoms, changes 
in color vision defects, or changes in fundoscop y assessments from baseline .
CONCLUSION S:
The rates of all -cause mortality  at Week 6 in the MI TT population were 19.5% and 
27.8% in the voriconazole/anidulafungin and voriconazole/placebo groups, respectivel y.  
The trend toward improved survival in the voriconazole/anidulafungin group did not 
achieve the prespecified level of statistical significance.
Additional mort ality analy ses generally  demonstrated survival advantages for the 
voriconazole/anidulafungin group for all secondary endpoints, though none of them were 
statistically  significant. Of the prespecified subgroup anal yses, statistically significant 
lower mort ality in the voriconazole/anidulafungin group was observed in the subgroup of 
subjects who were non -neutropenic at Baseline. For other subgroups, the differences 
were not statisticall y significant.
DRC -adjudicated global response in the MITT population at Week 6 was successful in 
32.6% of the subjects in the voriconazole/anidulafungin group and 43.0% of the subjects 
in the voriconazole/placebo group, with the trend in favor of monotherap y.  This was

group.
Based on the safety  data, it wa s concluded that the combination of voriconazole and 
anidulafungin has an acceptable safet y profile for the treatment of IA in adul t subjects 
with allogeneic stem cell transplants and hematologic malignancies.
