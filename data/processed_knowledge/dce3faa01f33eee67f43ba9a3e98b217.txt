Trends in Adaptive Design Methods in Dialysis Clinical
Trials: A Systematic Review
Conor Judge, Robert Murphy, Catriona Reddin, Sarah Cormican, Andrew Smyth,
Martin O ’Halloran, and Martin J. O ’Donnell
Rationale & Objective: Adaptive design methods
are intended to improve the ef ﬁciency of clinical
trials and are relevant to evaluating interventions in
dialysis populations. We sought to determine the
use of adaptive designs in dialysis clinical trials and
quantify trends in their use over time.
Study Design: We completed a novel full-text
systematic review that used a machine learning
classi ﬁer (RobotSearch) for ﬁltering randomized
controlled trials and adhered to the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-
analysis (PRISMA) guidelines.
Setting & Study Populations: We searched
MEDLINE (PubMed) and ClinicalTrials.gov using
sensitive dialysis search terms.
Selection Criteria for Studies: We included all
randomized clinical trials with patients receiving
dialysis or clinical trials with dialysis as a primary or
secondary outcome. There was no restriction of
disease type or intervention type.
Data Extraction & Analytical Approach: We per-
formed a detailed data extraction of trial characteris-
tics and a completed a narrative synthesis of the data.
Results: 57 studies, available as 68 articles and 7
ClinicalTrials.gov summaries, were included after
full-text review (initial search, 209,033 PubMedabstracts and 6,002 ClinicalTrials.gov summaries).
31 studies were conducted in a dialysis population
and 26 studies included dialysis as a primary or
secondary outcome. Although the absolute number
of adaptive design methods is increasing over time,
the relative use of adaptive design methods in
dialysis trials is decreasing over time (6.12 %in
2009 to 0.43 %in 2019, with a mean of 1.82 %).
Group sequential designs were the most common
type of adaptive design method used. Adaptive
design methods affected the conduct of 50.9 %of
trials, most commonly resulting in stopping early for
futility (41.2 %) and early stopping for safety
(23.5%). Acute kidney injury was studied in 32 trials
(56.1%), kidney failure requiring dialysis was
studied in 24 trials (42.1 %), and chronic kidney
disease was studied in 1 trial (1.75 %). 27 studies
(47 .4%) were supported by public funding. 44
studies (77 .2 %) did not report their adaptive design
method in the title or abstract and would not be
detected by a standard systematic review.
Limitations: We limited our search to 2 databases
(PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov ) due to the scale of
studies sourced (209,033 and 6,002 results,
respectively).
Conclusions: Adaptive design methods are used
in dialysis trials but there has been a decline in their
relative use over time.
Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the gold standard
for evaluating the efﬁcacy, futility, or harm of new
therapies.2Compared with similar medical specialties,
nephrology has traditionally had a low number of RCTs,particularly evident for patients with kidney failure
requiring dialysis.
3The comparatively low number of trials
are postulated to be due to difﬁcult recruitment, previoushistory of underpowered trials, and lack of funding.
4,5
Although the number of trials is increasing, nephrology
continues to lag behind other specialties such as cardiology,hematology/oncology, and gastroenterology.
6,7,*
Adaptive clinical trials use interim data analyses to
modify the trial design or duration in a predeﬁned way8
without undermining the integrity or validity of thetrial, thereby preserving the type 1 error (false-positive)
rate. The most common type of adaptive design is the
group sequential design, in which planned interim ana-lyses permit stopping of trials for efﬁcacy or futility. Otherdesigns include sample size re-estimation, multiarm
multistage trials, adaptive randomization, biomarker adap-tive, and seamless phase 2/3 trials
9(Box 1 ).
Adaptive clinical trials appear particularly suitable for
the evaluation of novel interventions in dialysis by
reducing resource requirements, decreasing time to study
completion, and increasing the likelihood of study success,that is, power to answer hypothesis.
10Previous trials in
dialysis have overly relied on observational data to informtrial design, including assumptions of expected effect sizeand variance,
11rather than estimates from early-phase
clinical trials. If incorrect, trials may be underpoweredwith an insufﬁcient sample size to answer the underlying
research question.
11Adaptive sample size re-estimation is a
potential solution, as commonly used in cardiology trials,12
such as planned blinded sample size re-estimation, whichidentiﬁes inaccurate assumptions, thereby triggering alteredrecruitment targets midtrial to ensure adequate power.
Adaptive design may also be relevant when evaluating
more established interventions. For example, the DeutscheDiabetes Dialyse Studie (4D)
13reported that atorvastatin,Complete author and article

20 mg per day, did not reduce cardiovascular events in
kidney failure requiring dialysis despite evidence of a 20%to 30% reduction in other populations.
14This trial
included a single dose of statin; it is hypothesized thatalternative or multiple doses may have been more bene-ﬁcial in a dialysis population given the signiﬁcantly alteredpharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
11,15An adap-
tive multiarm multistage trial design may have been more
appropriate with 1 interim analysis at the end of stage I toidentify an optimum dose to take forward into stage II. Forexample, the Telmisartan and Insulin Resistance in HIV(TAILoR) trial used a multiarm multistage design with 1interim analysis to identify the most appropriate doseamong 3 telmisartan doses (20, 40, and 80 mg daily). All3 doses were tested in stage I and telmisartan, 80 mg, was
taken forward into stage II.

This systematic review aims to: (1) summarize the use
of adaptive design methodology in RCTs in dialysis pop-ulations and populations at risk for requiring dialysis; (2)describe the characteristics of the trials that use adaptivedesigns, including dialysis modality, funding, andgeographical location; (3) describe the characteristics ofadaptive trial designs in dialysis trials; (4) estimate the
percentage of adaptive clinical trials in dialysis among all
dialysis RCT; and (5) outline temporal trends in all of theabove.
METHODS
We performed a systematic review, reported according
to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Re-v i e w sa n dM e t a - a n a l y s e s( P R I S M A )g u i d e l i n e s .
17The
protocol was registered with PROSPERO(CRD42020163946) and published separately.
18There
were no age or English language restrictions. Aftertesting our predeﬁned search strategy,
18we found a
small number (n =16) of dialysis RCTs that reported
an adaptive design method. We discovered that the
adaptive design methods are often not reported in thetitle and abstract of articles and would not be detectedin a traditional systematic search. To overcome this,
we developed a novel “full-text systematic review”protocol and to our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst use ofthis methodology.
Search Method for the Identi ﬁcation of Trials
Electronic Search: Dialysis Studies
We performed an electronic search on MEDLINE
(PubMed) and ClinicalTrials.gov from database incep-
tion until June 1, 2020. Zotero was used as our referencemanager. The dialysis searc h terms were adapted from
Beaubien-Souligny et al,
192019 (and included dialysis,
peritoneal dialysis, hemodia lysis, hemodiaﬁltration,
hemodiaﬁltration, hemoﬁltration, haemoﬁltration,extracorporeal blood cleans ing, haemodialysis, renal
dialysis, renal replacement, end stage kidney, end stage
renal, stage 5 kidney , and stage 5 renal ( Table S1 ). The
output was stored in the Research Information Systemsﬁle format for PubMed and XML ﬁles for ClinicalTrials.
gov.Box 1. Adaptive Trial Designs
Seamless phase 2-3 design: Combines a traditional phase
2 with a phase 3 trial. Referred to as the “learning ”phase and
“conﬁrmatory ”phase. This design can reduce sample size
and time to market for a positive treatment.
Sample-size re-estimation design: Allows for sample-
size adjustment or re-estimation based on the results of
interim analysis. Particularly useful if there is uncertainty
about the treatment effect and variability and when inaccu-rate estimates could lead to overpowered or underpowered
trials.
GSD: Allows a trial to stop early based on the results of
interim analysis. GSD is the most common type of adaptivedesign. GSD can take 3 forms: early ef ﬁcacy stopping, early
futility stopping, and early ef ﬁcacy or futility stopping design.
Multiarm multistage: A multistage design with several
treatment arms. At interim analysis, inferior treatment arms
are dropped based on prespeci ﬁed criteria. Ultimately the
best arms and the control group are retained. Some exam-ples are pick-the-winners or drop-the-loser designs.
Biomarker-adaptive design: Allows for adaptations using
information obtained from biomarkers. Often used in drug
trials to target very selective populations for whom the druglikely works well. The biomarker response at interim analysis
can be used to determine the target population.
Adaptive dose-escalation design: The dose level used to
treat the next patient is based on the toxicity in the previouspatients and escalation rules.
Abbreviation: GSD, group sequential design,PLAIN-LANGUAGE SUMMARY
Adaptive designs make clinical trials more efﬁcient and
are one part of the solution for optimizing the design of
clinical trials in dialysis. We performed a systematic
review by searching 2 large databases for dialysis trials
with adaptive designs and found 57 examples. They are
used mostly in trials of acute kidney injury, affected
(changed a trial) half the studies they were used in, and
are usually not reported in titles or abstracts of articles.
We also found that the relative use of adaptive designs
in nephrology is decreasing over time. Greater knowl-edge of adaptive design examples in dialysis will further
improve uptake in dialysis randomized clinical trials.Judge et al

Machine Learning Classi ﬁer: RCTs
We used the high-sensitivity machine learning classiﬁer
(RobotSearch) to identify RCTs from the PubMed dialysissearch output.
15RobotSearch is a machine learning clas-
siﬁcation algorithm combining an ensemble of supportvector machines and convolutional neural networks with a
reported area under the curve of 0.987 (95% CI, 0.984-
0.989) for RCT classiﬁcation. We adjusted the parametersof RobotSearch to perform a sensitive search to increase theproportion of RCTs that are correctly identiﬁed.
15Studies
classiﬁed as likely to be RCTs were sourced for the full-textsystematic review.
Full-Text Systematic Review: Adaptive Design
Methods
We used Recoll for Windows to perform a full-text sys-
tematic review on our dialysis randomized clinical trial
search results from PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov . Recoll
is based on the Xapian search engine library and provides apowerful text extraction layer and a graphical interface.The adaptive design search terms were adapted fromBothwell et al,
202018, and included phase 2/3, treatment
switching, biomarker adaptive, biomarker adaptive design,biomarker adjusted, adaptive hypothesis, adaptive dose
ﬁnding, pick the winner, drop the loser, sample size re-
estimation, re-estimations, adaptive randomization,group sequential, adaptive seamless, adaptive design,interim monitoring, Bayesian adaptive, ﬂexible design,adaptive trial, play the winner, adaptive method, adaptive
and dose and adjusting, response adaptive, adaptive allo-cation, adaptive signature design, treatment adaptive, co-
variate adaptive, and sample size adjustment ( Table S2 ).
Manual Full-Text Review
We then performed manual full-text review to conﬁrm
studies that were included in the ﬁnal systematic review.This process is summarized in a PRISMA ﬂowchart ( Fig 1 ).
Full-text review was performed by C.J., R.M., and C.R.Disagreements were resolved by consensus and when a
resolution was not reached by discussion, a consensus was
reached through a third reviewer (M.J.O.).

medical devices, dialysis parameters, and dialysis modality.
Dialysis parameter is any speciﬁcation of the dialysis
treatment that can be changed at each session, for example,duration, ultraﬁltration rate, and sodium proﬁling. Weincluded all outcomes including surrogate markers,patient-centered outcomes, and hard clinical outcomes.
Selection and Analysis of Trials
C.J., R.M., and C.R. extracted the study characteristics
independently and in parallel. Data collected included
type of the adaptive design, stopping rule, impact ofadaptive design (ie, stopping for futility or efﬁcacy andsample size changes), trial population, intervention,dialysis modality, the country of the lead investigator,and the funder of the study (adapted from Hatﬁeldet al,
212016; Table S3 ).
Assessment of the Quality of the Studies: Risk of Bias
We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 Tool22to assess
methodological quality of eligible trials, including randomsequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding ofparticipants and health care personnel, blinded outcomeassessment, completeness of outcome data, evidence ofselective reporting, and other biases. Risk-of-bias assess-ments were performed independently by C.J., R.M., C.R.,
and S.C. and disagreements were resolved by consensus. If
1 or more domains was rated as high, the study wasconsidered at high risk of bias. We summarized ourﬁndings in a risk-of-bias table using the revised Cochranerisk-of-bias tool for randomized trials
23(Table S4 ).
Data Synthesis
A descriptive synthesis of the data was performed. We
reported overall outcomes and outcomes by: (1) frequency
and type of adaptive design; (2) adaptive designs as aproportion of studies classiﬁed as dialysis RCTs byRobotSearch; (3) population, intervention, and outcome,including dialysis modality (hemodialysis, peritonealdialysis, hemodiaﬁltration, and hemoﬁltration); (4) pub-lication in high-impact journals; (5) geographic locationand funding; (6) reporting of adaptive design methods in
title and abstract; and (7) a risk-of-bias assessment.
RESULTS

Study Characteristics
Frequency and Type of Adaptive Design
Figure 2 reports the number of adaptive designs by year
and alongside the proportion of all dialysis RCTs that usedadaptive design methods. The absolute amount of dialysistrials using adaptive designs has increased each year butthis has not matched the overall increase in dialysis trialsand resulted in a relative decrease over time in the use ofadaptive design methods in dialysis trials, ranging from
6.12% in 2009 to 0.43% in 2019, with a mean of 1.82%.
A 1-way analysis of var1ance was conducted to deter-mine whether the proportion of adaptive trials wasdifferent by year. Adaptive trials proportion was statis-tically signiﬁcantly different between years, F
17=3.391;
P<0.001. Tukey post hoc analysis revealed statistically
signiﬁcant differences between 2009 and 2013 ( −5.96
[95% CI, −10.73 to −1.19]; P=0.002); 2019 ( −5.7
[95% CI, −10.36 to −1.04]; P=0.003); 2018 ( −5.62 [95%
CI,−10.29 to −0.96]; P=0.003), 2015 ( −5.33 [95%
CI,−10.21 to −0.45]; P=0.02), 2020 ( −5.07 [95% CI, −9.81
to−0.34]; P=0.021]; and between 2014 and 2019 ( −3.67
[95% CI, −6.69 to −0.65]; P=0.003) and 2018 ( −3.6
[95% CI, −6.62 to −0.58]; P=0.004).
Group sequential designs were the most common type
of adaptive design method used; 35 (61.4%) trials (22
[71%] in dialysis populations and 13 [50%] in dialysis
outcome trials; Table 124-65). The O’Brien-Fleming stop-
ping boundary was the most common stopping rule, usedin 9 trials (25.7%), followed by Lan DeMets, used in 8trials (22.9%). A total of 29 trials (50.9%) were affectedby the use of group sequential adaptive design, including 7trials (41.2%) that stopped early for futility, 3 trials(17.6%) that stopped early for efﬁcacy, and 4 trials
(23.5%) that stopped early for safety.
Sample-size re-estimation was the second most com-
mon type of adaptive design, used in 14 trials (24.6%); 8(25.8%) in dialysis populations and 6 (23.1%) in dialysisoutcome trials ( Table 2
66-82). Eight trials (57.1%) were
affected by the use of sample-size re-estimation adaptivedesign including 6 trials (75%) that increased samplesize.
Phase 2/3 seamless design was the third most common
type of adaptive design; 5 trials (8.8%); 1 (3.23%) indialysis populations and 4 (15.4%) in dialysis outcometrials ( Table 3
83-89). Adaptive dose-escalation, Bayesian
adaptive design, and interim analysis were used in 1 trialeach.

Population, Intervention, and Outcome Studied
AKI was studied in 32 trials (56.1%), kidney failure
requiring dialysis was studied in 24 trials (42.1%), andchronic kidney disease (CKD) was studied in 1 trial(1.75%). Figure 3 reports the number of each population
under study per year and shows a larger increase inadaptive design methods in AKI populations comparedwith kidney failure requiring dialysis populations. Medi-
cations were the most common intervention type, evalu-
ated in 35 trials (61.4%), followed by dialysis modality in7 trials (12.3%) and dialysis parameter in 4 trials (7%).Hemodialysis was the most common dialysis modalitystudied in 32 trials (56.1%), followed by hemodialysis andhemodiaﬁltration in 8 trials (14%); hemodialysis, hemo-diaﬁltration, and hemoﬁltration in 7 trials (12.3%); andperitoneal dialysis in 4 trials (7%). Hard clinical outcomes
were selected in 34 trials (59.6%), followed by surrogate
outcomes in 20 trials (35.1%) and mixed in 3 trials(5.3%). The outcome measure was continuous in 15 trials(26.3%) and dichotomous in 42 trials (73.7%). Phase 3studies were the most common study phase, studied in 41trials (71.9%; Tables 1-3 ).
Publication in High-Impact Journals
A total of 32 studies (56.1%) were published in a high-
impact journal (impact factor >9). Fourteen studies
(24.6%) were published in the New England Journal of Medicine ,
6 studies (10.5%) were published in the Journal of the
American Medical Association , 4 studies (7%) were published in
Trials , and 2 studies (3.5%) were published in the Journal of
the American Society of Nephrology .Geographic Location and Funding
The most common country of the lead author was the
United States in 24 studies (42.1%), followed by Germanyin 7 studies (12.3%), France in 4 studies (7%), theNetherlands in 4 studies (7%), Australia in 3 studies(5.3%), and the United Kingdom in 3 studies (6%;Tables 1-3 ). Forty-nine studies (86%) were multicenter
trials. Twenty-seven studies (47.4%) were supported by
public funding, 21 studies (36.8%) were supported by
private funding, 7 studies (12.3%) were supported byboth public and private funding, and 2 studies (3.5%) didnot report the source of funding.
Reporting of Adaptive Design Method in Title and
Abstract
A total of 44 studies (77.2%) did not report their adaptive
design method in the title or abstract and would not bedetected by a standard systematic review search.
Risk of Bias
Risk of bias was assessed for 40 trials (protocols andclinicaltrials.gov were excluded; Fig S1 ;Table S4 ). Overall
risk of bias was deemed to be “low” in 17 trials (42.5%),“some concerns” in 13 trials (32.5%), and “high risk” in10 trials (25%). The randomization process led to some
concerns for 10 studies (25%). Deviations from intended
interventions led to some concerns for 4 studies (10%) andhigh risk for 6 studies (15%). Missing outcome data weredeemed to be some concerns for 2 studies (5%) trials andhigh risk of bias for 2 studies (5%). Measurement of02468

DISCUSSION
In this systematic review, we report that adaptive design
methods were used in 57 dialysis RCTs over a 20-year
period. Although the absolute number has increased overtime, the relative use of adaptive design methods in trialsin dialysis populations and trials with dialysis as an endpoint has decreased.
First, we report that the relative proportion of adaptive
design methods in dialysis trials has decreased over time.The absolute number of dialysis trials using adaptive de-
signs has increased each year, but this has not matched the
overall increase in dialysis trials and therefore resulted in arelative decrease. We were unable to compare this resultwith other specialties because recent systematic reviewshave not reported the relative use of adaptive designs.
21,90
Second, we report that group sequential designs are the
most used type of adaptive design in dialysis trials. This issimilar to previous systematic reviews in cardiology
91and
oncology90and in a review of registered clinical trials
covering multiple specialties on clinicaltrials.gov.21
Third, we report that adaptive designs were more
common in AKI (56.1% of trials) than kidney failurerequiring dialysis (42.1% of trials). This may reﬂectincreasing use of adaptive design methodology in criticalcare
92and sepsis-related trials,93in which AKI is most
common. There were very few trials of CKD with a dialysis
outcome (2%) that used an adaptive design. Many reasons
for the paucity of CKD trials have been previously sug-gested, including the use of treatments in CKD despite alack of evidence, difﬁculty recruiting to CKD trials due tostringent eligibility criteria, and underpowered subgroupanalysis.
4,94The infrequent use of adaptive designs in CKD
trials may become a self-perpetuating barrier to usingadaptive designs in future trials.
21
Fourth, we report that adaptive design methods affected
the conduct of the randomized trial in most studies(50.9%). For example, 17 (48.6%) trials were affected bythe use of group sequential adaptive design, including 7trials (41.2%) stopped early for futility, 3 trials (17.6%)stopped early for efﬁcacy, and 4 trials (23.5%) stoppedearly for safety. This ﬁnding is similar to a systematic re-view of published and publicly available trials in which the
most common reason for stopping group sequential trials
was futility.
20
Fifth, we found that the most common country of the
lead author was the United States, 24 studies (42.1%), andthe most common funding source was public, 27 studies(47.4%). This ﬁnding was different from a systematic re-view of published and publicly available trials in which65% of trials reported industry funding.

kidney research reached an all-time low in 20135but this
has recently changed in the United States with advocacy
from scientiﬁc societies such as the American Society ofNephrology, whereby an executive order was signed in2020 to reform the US end-stage kidney disease treatmentindustry.
95Adaptive designs are one part of the solution
for optimizing the design of clinical trials in dialysis andnephrology and will beneﬁt from the improvement in thefunding landscape.
94
Our study has several limitations. First, we limited our
search to 2 databases (PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov )
due to the scale of studies sourced (209,033 and 6,002results). This was a devia tion from our protocol but
necessary to make this full-text review feasible. Second,we decided to include RCTs with dialysis outcomes inaddition to patients current ly receiving dialysis. This
permitted a more comprehe nsive review of the full
landscape of AKI, kidney failu re requiring dialysis, and
CKD trials, but was a deviation from our original pro-tocol. Third, the denominator for calculating the pro-portion of adaptive designs in all dialysis RCTs willinclude some false positives, that is, either not RCTs ornot dialysis. We modiﬁed the parameters of the machinelearning classiﬁer to perform a sensitive search to include
as many true positives as possible. We expect this
misclassiﬁcation bias to be i ndependent of time and bias
every year equally and therefore not affect the trend.Fourth, publication bias, in which negative studies arenot published, will bias out results toward the null, forexample, our estimate of the impact of adaptive design(50.9%) would be higher if unpublished studies stoppedfor futility and not published were included.
In summary, we developed a novel full-text systematic
review search strategy. Forty-four studies (77.2%) did not
report their adaptive design method in the title or abstractand would not be detected by a standard systematic reviewsearch methodology. This could introduce a reporting biasin which adaptive design methods are reported in the mainarticle but not in the abstract. Our novel strategy combinedclassical systematic review, machine learning classiﬁers,and a novel full-text systematic review. This new method
has broad applications in medical evidence synthesis and
evidence synthesis in general.
Adaptive design methods improve the efﬁciency of
RCTs in dialysis but their relative use in dialysis isdecreasing over time. Greater knowledge of adaptivedesign examples in dialysis will further improve uptake indialysis RCTs.
