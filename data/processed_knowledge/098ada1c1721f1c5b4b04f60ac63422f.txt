Lean Authoring: Checklist of lean authoring best practices for efficient data exchange A Health Authority (HA)  must safeguard patients’ health using medicinal products. To do that, HAs 
require documented proof of the quality of the product and its production process, the product’s 
nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology data, and the clinical safety and efficacy. 
The development costs of a medicine are comprised of the costs for pharmaceutical development, 
production of the pharmaceutical products, the nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology studies 
and the clinical studies. On top of that, proof of a medicinal product’s quality, safety, and efficacy 
needs to be documented to allow health authorities to review and approve it for use in well-con-
trolled clinical trials and eventually in a less controlled market situation. 
The reality is that therapeutics need to be approved by each region or country separately; 
therefore, respective, tailored dossiers are required. If there is obvious documented proof, all 
health authorities will simultaneously come to the same conclusion. However, HAs may have 
their own requirements, various levels of expertise, and prior knowledge when evaluating the 
information in a dossier. As a result, some HAs might request more detailed information or apply 
narrower acceptance criteria than others. Even differences in the packaging (e.g., tablets packed in 
blisters versus bottles), different ranges of strengths, and various manufacturers used to supply a 
market may result in the need for diverging information to support a marketing authorization. For 
marketing authorization holders, this results in complexity in tracking what version/configuration 
of a medicinal product has been submitted to and approved by the respective HAs. From their 
perspective, HAs aim to objectively review and align their assessments of similar or identical 
applications for marketing authorizations.
Currently, the main document format to exchange information between applicants and HAs is 
PDF. Most of the information is shared in narratives, supported by graphs and tables. Sometimes, 
the information in the table is even reworded into a narrative. Why is data not presented as data? 
Are analyses run on the data, and only interpretations of the analyses are captured as narratives? 
Because it has been done like that since the introduction of paper dossiers over 80 years ago!
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearly recognized the shortcomings of data locked 
in PDFs and, over time, requested clinical data (and later also nonclinical data) in datasets. Other 
HAs only require entry of some key characteristics of a drug in a database in addition to the 
eCTD (e.g., in the European Union (EU), entry of key SmPC elements in XEVMPD, and recently 
implemented in an electronic application form). Lean authoring is a recognized approach to 
bridging the gap.
Lean authoring allows a reader to focus on the relevant data and prevents data from being 
duplicated in different documents. Every duplication has an inherent risk of inconsistencies. Lean 
authoring further facilitates document maintenance when addressing the impact of a proposed 
change in a drug’s production, quality, or usage. It also decreases the number of documents to be 
managed and the time to author, review and maintain documents (see Table 1).1. Introduction

Audits simplified Improved documentation helps the submission 
process and sets pharmaceutical companies 
up for success on audits and improves quality. Saves time and audit costs through better 
preparation from pharmaceutical companies 
and quality documentation.Lean authoring aims at eliminating unnecessary words, punctuation, complex sentences etc. to 
make writing as clear and succinct as possible. This style of writing facilitates focus and makes 
use of simple words and short sentences. It is not only about what is written but also about how it 
is written and presented (visual style and overall readability).
Lean authoring involves streamlining the writing process and reviewing, publishing, and 
maintaining standalone reusable documents using standardized templates, modular content, and 
meaningful, unambiguous, relevant cross references.
The goal of lean authoring is:
 .To speed up the knowledge transfer by reducing the verbiage for documented content
 .To re-use documents rather than re-create
 .To improve the reliability of the knowledge, leaving less uncertainty to the receiving party 
of the document
 .To allow for faster decision-making.
The standardized structure of a Common Technical Document (CTD) for pharmaceutical products 
facilitates the submission of a regulatory application consisting of multiple documents, each 
containing specific information. The CTD consists of a coherent assembly of relevant documents. 
Lean authoring becomes important when applying a lifecycle to documents and dossiers, e.g., in 
the electronic CTD (eCTD). For example, replacement documents can only be applied to whole 
documents and not to part of the documents. In addition, the documents currently approved by the 
HAs must comply with the current production process, quality and proper usage of the medicine. 
Mere inconsistencies throughout the approved documents of a regulatory dossier represent 
non-compliance.
The principles used to author documents can significantly impact the efficiency and quality of 
the output. Traditional authoring often involves a linear, extensive approach with multiple drafts, 
lengthy processes, and extensive revisions. By contrast, lean authoring focuses on streamlining 
these processes by delivering value through iterative improvements and reducing waste. Lean 
authoring provides factual data in easy to consume formats such as tables and bulleted lists 
which organizes information in a clear, concise manner.  Moving from traditional authoring to lean 
authoring involves adopting several key principles to enhance knowledge transfer, readability, and 
data consumption. 
By integrating lean authoring into operations, the pharmaceutical industry can enhance its ability 
to produce high-quality, compliant, and impactful content efficiently. This will ultimately improve 
overall productivity and better serve patients and healthcare professionals.
A comprehensive comparison of lean authoring principles to traditional methods is provided in 
Table 2, later in this document.2. What Is Lean Authoring

Lean Authoring: Checklist of lean authoring best practices for efficient data exchange Of course the pharmaceutical industry collects enormous amounts of data, they have the data in 
databases; they do their own analyses, write reports to evaluate the findings and make decisions 
to develop a drug further or to terminate the development. Similarly, all the disciplines write 
development reports, progress reports and study reports under the predicate rules of GLP , GMP 
and GCP . Though the study reports compliant with GLP and GCP can often be used as such in 
a regulatory dossier, the GMP reports are not submitted to the HAs. For Module 3, those GMP 
reports are rewritten to Module 3 documents. 
Why not hand over the relevant data from industry to HAs in the first place? Why reuse data and 
rewrite information in PDF documents by industry that subsequently must be interpreted and 
verified by HAs? The answer lies in the data model, semantics, reliability of the data and exchange 
standard.
Example concepts to incorporate: 
 .Think about how the data will be used and consumed – create for consumption
 .Prepare ease of data extraction and processing for regulatory authorities
 .Simplification of data review and analysis
 .Present data in a table and omit the conversion to prose (repetition)
 .Avoid scanned documents - capture as an image 
Publishing and document management in pharmaceutical companies have evolved from manual, 
paper-based methods to digital platforms and lean authoring practices, improving efficiency 
in regulatory document creation and distribution. This evolution has prioritized accessibility, 
compliance, and patient safety through streamlined processes and enhanced content 
management systems.
Specifically, the formats have evolved.  Originally, submissions and documents were on paper. 
This moved to digitization with PDFs. However, PDFs did not solve the need for sections and data 3. A Mindset Change Is Needed
3.1. Evolution of Regulatory DocumentsThe field of lean authoring and optimizing for authorizations will continue to evolve.  The future 
will continue to focus on anticipated changes in regulatory requirements, preparing for future 
compliance challenges.

Lean Authoring: Checklist of lean authoring best practices for efficient data exchange The future of lean authoring in ICH M4Q and beyond will likely be characterized by a greater reliance on 
technology, increased collaboration, and a focus on data-driven decision-making. These advancements 
will make the authoring process more efficient and improve the quality and compliance of regulatory 
submissions. As the industry evolves, companies adopting these practices will be better positioned to 
meet regulatory requirements and bring new drugs to market more swiftly and effectively.
Leveraging Lean Authoring Method - Output Centric:
Future data and document exchange within and across industry and agencies

     Summary and CTD Module 3to be sent to different places. The next phase was a database like the eCTD format. But despite all 
the advantages of eCTD, it is still a collection of PDFs. The change needs to be at the input level. 
The real transformation is about manageable elements that can be dynamically grouped to be sent 
with the right content and context. 
IDMP , PQ/CMC and ICH M4Q Revision 2 aim for more factual information in databases. Scientific 
evaluations can be limited to eCTD Module 2 and electronic product information that can 
immediately be linked to the scientific evaluations, which are linked to the analyses based on 
the data in the database. The exchange of information might change from sending packages to 
sharing the information in cloud information.

Lean Authoring: Checklist of lean authoring best practices for efficient data exchange The first principle is the most important, separating out text and data.  This sets up the data to be 
reused in multiple documents with the appropriate text ‘wrapper’ for context. The writer will want 
to avoid long, verbose prose or reaching a certain number of pages. 4. Principles Of Lean Authoring
4.1. Principle 1: Separate Text And Data
“Essays should be long enough to reach a meaningful 
destination and cover essential points, but short enough to 
maintain interest along the way.”
Hans van Bruggen, 2024 
Tabular data and text/prose are complementary tools, each for the right job:
Text / Prose Tabular Data
 .Contextual richness, narrative depth 
 .Used to convey complex ideas, 
explain relationships, and provide 
qualitative insights 
 .Essential in communicating 
nuanced information
 .Use cases: clinical findings, 
regulatory implications, and patient 
narratives .Presents qualitative details well
 .Concise and organized format
 .Ideal for displaying numerical or 
categorical information
 .Use cases: quick comparisons, 
trend analysis, and data 
aggregation; scientific research 
and statistical analysis

Lean Authoring: Checklist of lean authoring best practices for efficient data exchange Tabular data and text/prose are complementary tools, each for the right job:The second principle is to create the context for each data set. The data will be used as ‘elements’ 
or modules in different end documents for various HAs or therapeutics.  No branding is needed 
in the documents other than the cover letter, application form, and product information, which are 
regional documents as intended.

Lean Authoring: Checklist of lean authoring best practices for efficient data exchange The third principle is to apply templates.  Based on years of experience with submissions, 
Celegence provides pharmaceutical companies with templates. 
Here are some best practices related to template use:
 .Keep the end game in mind and compliance-ready along the way 
 .Provide information only once and at the dedicated location 
 .Apply lean authoring, including lean cross-referencing principles 
 .Follow the lean authoring principles covered in Table 2, including lean cross-referencing 
principles, hyperlinking of cross-references to avoid obsolete links and following future 
changes in destination documents. Module 3 is very structured and does not need many 
cross-references
 .Include requirements early in the document creation process4.3. Principle 3: Use Templates
Principle 4 sets the organization up for success through maintenance: 
 .Establish a strong data governance that covers controlled vocabularies/terminology
 .Map tables to align to other controlled vocabularies for the same concept
 .Reference authoritative sources of data 
 .Define roles that foster cross-functional collaboration and communication 
 .Establish organizational accountability and support
 .Training and guidelines for authors
 .Invest in tools and technologies for lean authoring, such as AI-driven solutions for error 
detection and content management, plus dedicated dossier management 4.4.  Principle 4: A Framework for Repeatable              
  and Sustained Change
4.5. Lean Authoring Example
But what is possible now when the exchange standard is still PDF? In a PoC at one of our 
customers, we developed a transition stepping stone towards data models, semantics and 
reliability while the exchange mechanism was still in PDF.

Lean Authoring: Checklist of lean authoring best practices for efficient data exchange We applied the following rules:
 .Move away from narrative texts for factual data and information; provide tabular formats.
 .Tables are preceded by a table title to inform the reader on the subject
 .Tables consist of a table header, left-hand column and right-hand column:
 »The table header informs the reader on what the attribute names are and its corre-
sponding values
 »The left-hand column lists the attribute names (or predicate)
 »The right-hand column lists the corresponding values and subject

Based on the above representation of information and the logic of interpreting the information, 
the data is available for extraction into a database. As a result, PDF documents have become 
an industry standard for data exchange. This is not optimal, though; the values in MS Word can 
be tagged with the attribute names, rendered to PDF version 1.8, and those tags will remain in 
the PDF rendition. Subsequently, the information can be extracted from the PDFs. A positive 
Proof of Concept study was done by the IRISS Forum in 2014. At that moment, a data model 
was considered necessary to continue the development of that solution. Even now, there is still 
no data model because of the lack of agreement on a model. It is recommended that stepping 
stones towards a new model be accepted. 
Often, the authors of regulatory documents provide too much information about a particular 
topic rather than convey a message. In addition, to exchange regulatory information, we still 
rely on the exchange of PDF files in a regulatory dossier.  
4.6.  Overcoming Common Challenges in Lean  
  Processes for Pharmaceutical Submissions
Potential Challenge Solution
Ensuring Compliance with Diverse 
Regulatory RequirementsDevelop a comprehensive regulatory intelligence system that tracks and 
updates regulatory requirements for different regions. Use this system to 
create dynamic templates that apply to various regulations.
Managing Cross-Functional CollaborationUse collaborative platforms that allow real-time editing and feedback. 
Schedule regular cross-functional meetings to align teams on project goals 
and timelines.
Reducing Time and Increasing EfficiencyLeverage automation tools for repetitive tasks such as format (e.g., proper 
use of upper case), compliance checks (whether no empty fields ar e 
present), and eCTD readiness (for allowed fonts, page layouts and cross 
references). Implement parallel review processes where different sections 
of the document can be reviewed simultaneously.
Maintaining Document Quality and 
ConsistencyDevelop a rigorous quality control process that includes a single round 
for the content review and a single round for the eCTD readiness check. 
Use standardized templates and apply text editing features to ensure 
consistency across documents; a text editor (like MS-Word) is more than a 
type writing machine.
Integrating Advanced TechnologyInvest in a robust electronic content management system (eCMS) and 
document automation tools. Ensure seamless integration with other 
systems such as regulatory or enterprise information management 
systems (EIMS/RIMS).
Managing Change and Adoption of New 
PracticesImplement change management practices, including clear communication 
of the benefits of lean authoring, the benefits of proper templates and text 
editing features, and involve key stakeholders in the transition process.

Lean Authoring: Checklist of lean authoring best practices for efficient data exchange By adopting these solutions, pharmaceutical companies can overcome common challenges in lean 
authoring, resulting in efficient, high-quality, and compliant regulatory submissions that benefit 
patient safety and healthcare outcomes.
“Improving the reliability of the data quality increases the 
efficiency not only within a pharmaceutical organization but 
also increases the efficiency from Health Authorities to a 
pharmaceutical organization.”

Stakeholder 
Buy-inStakeholders reviewed a document that contained 
information in context of a named purpose (such 
as, IND for the US or MAA for the EU). To inform 
the reader about the purpose, this was often 
mentioned in the documents and documents had 
to be re-written to use it for a different purpose 
(such as a complete document of control of drug 
product, including the analytical procedures, 
validation and justification).Gain buy-in from all stakeholders, including writers, 
reviewers, and regulatory affairs teams, who can 
see the document for review in context from other 
documents that define the purpose of use, such as 
a dossier containing the application form or other 
CTD documents that provide more context around its 
purpose, or, the analytical procedure and its validation 
when reviewing the justification of the specifications.
Patient Safety The needs of patient safety and ethics transcend 
regional borders. Yet, the fragmented approach 
was not optimized for patient safety given limited 
comparison ability across regions and documents. 
The siloed approach does not benefit patients.Create standalone documents that are reusable across 
regions without any rework. If different formulations 
and strengths are used across regions, enable the 
ability to pick and choose the documents that are 
relevant to a particular dose form or strength. Hence, 
identical documents can be re-used across countries to 
safeguard the country’s patients.
Human Expertise Knowledge centralized to a small number 
of experts, which creates bottlenecks and 
overdependence on a few people.Identify SMEs up front; review content for technical 
soundness, scientific accuracy, and adherence to 
regulatory guidelines.
Version Control 
SystemContent vulnerable to errors and quality issues due 
to different versions and iterations of common 
documents.Reusable content modules avoids confusion or errors.

Document Specific Tactics 
Language:  
British English 
versus US EnglishBritish English was often used for the EU (and 
UK) submissions whereas the documents were 
changed to US English for the US.Considering the Common Technical Document, one 
can choose to use US or British English, as long as 
the language is consistently used within a document. 
The same applies for the decimal dot versus comma. 
Hence, in the eCTD, it is possible that one document  –
is in US-English, whereas another document is in British 
English. Module 1, containing the regional information, 
such as cover letter and application form and the 
product information (e.g. PI and SmPC) must be in the 
local language and use the appropriate decimal comma 
or dot. That means for Module 2 – 5, all documents can 
be reused across countries.
Managing minor 
spelling ‘errors’ 
in regulatory 
documentsUpon re-using a document, spelling mistakes/
typos might be spotted. Often a new version 
was created to correct it prior to use, such as a 
document for the next submission. This often 
results in two slightly different versions in the 
document management system.Slightly different documents (e.g., for typos), should 
not be updated prior to the next submission. Updating 
a document means that one country received a 
version with the typo and another without the typo. 
For a computer these two files are distinctly different, 
whereas for a human being, these are the same. Only 
when the typo concerns a different meaning would the 
documents have to be updated (e.g. 10 mg vs 1.0 mg).
Font Type In paper documents all font types were possible, 
as long as the printer was able to print it.For electronic documents,  the PDF  should be readable 
in its electronic format,  such as 50 years from now. 
The font types of Arial, Courier and Times New Roman 
are considered still readable for this period. Other 
fonts are not necessarily available in the reader’s PDF 
browsers. To be on the safe side, the PDF needs to 
embed the relevant subsets of any font type used in the 
PDF, other than Arial, Courier, and Times New Roman. 
Special 
CharactersOften special characters are included by the 
author as font type Symbol. Though the author 
clearly sees the immediate result, and will see 
this properly reflected in the author’s PDF, its 
appearance is dependent on the browser used to 
read a PDF. If neither the browser recognizes the 
font type of a character and the font types are not 
embedded, a special character might be shown as 
a box (like     ) or the regular character (like ‘mg’ 
instead of µg). The latter is of course a serious 
difference.What is true for the above font types is also true for 
font types like Symbol and Wingdings, which are often 
used for special characters. Hence, it is best to stick 
with Arial or Times New Roman, and to use ‘normal 
text’ when including special characters.

DocumentsLean Authoring Leading To eCTD-Ready              
Documents
Document Specific Tactics 
Heading 1 versus 
TitleHeadings are used to structure the content of a 
document. The title of a document is different 
from Heading 1. Too often Heading 1 is misused to 
show the title in the bookmarks. Since only 4 level 
bookmarks are recommended, misusing the first 
level results in the use of three levels only.Up to the fourth level bookmarks are recommended 
(when applicable), for large documents such as 
overviews, summaries and study reports. By applying 
the right Heading styles, the resulting PDF will present a 
meaningful list of bookmarks upon rendition to the PDF. 
Moreover, the title of a document should be part of the 
recurring header of a document.
Section Breaks & 
Headers/FootersSection breaks in MS-Word include the page 
layout and margins, formatting characteristics 
and its header and footer information for the 
corresponding section. The relevance of this is 
often underestimated.By reducing the use of section breaks, it reduces the 
risks for individual changes in the formatting and 
header/footer content. In the event of differences in 
page orientation, the header and footer can be kept  
the ‘same as previous’. Provided that the headers have 
been built correctly, the headers will spread out nicely, 
irrespective of orientation for less manual rework.
Introductory 
Texts in 
DocumentsTraditionally, it would not matter if a chapter 
started with a narrative, followed by numbered 
heading.In the digital world, a change in document granularity 
can happen over time (e.g. limited amount of detail in 
the pharmaceutical development section in the IND/
CTA stage, whereas lots of information at the NDA/
MAA stage. As a result, a single document with 5 small 
chapters can be used for the IND, while later, it is split 
into five documents, each with its own structure. What 
were previously the names of the chapters, have now 
become the subtitles of a CTD section, and should 
become apparent in the header. To accommodate this 
evolution of a topic, the document should be able to be 
split without any rework. Be aware that there should be 
no ‘orphan’ texts at the same level as subheadings in a 
chapter.
Document 
GranularitySince the introduction of the paper CTD, 
documents have been authored in accordance 
with the granularity of ICH M4 (remainder of the 
regulatory dossier) and ICH E3 (for CSRs). The 
eCTD specifications suggested a finer document 
granularity, but the trend was set to a coarse 
granularity.The finer the granularity, the more standalone 
documents can be created that can be reused for 
multiple purposes, such as multiple countries, products 
and application types. And the XML backbone of the 
eCTD creates a meaningful table of contents to put the 
documents in the right order, ensuring the correct flow 
of the messaging.
Cross 
ReferencingIn scientific journals and theses, many cross 
references must be provided to substantiate the 
value of the message.Regulatory documents must always be seen in context 
of a common technical document (CTD). The common 
structure has a home for every type of regulatory 
information. This common structure is known by all the 
stake holders, hence, the need for cross referencing is 
limited, because the common structure defines where 
what information is to be provided.
Automatically updated cross references can be applied 
during the editing phase using the feature cross 
reference to a named heading, caption (for tables and 
figures) or endnote (for reference lists).
File Path For 
Storing Electronic 
DossiersLong path lengths were used to be descriptive 
without regard for application; the naming was 
often truncated resulting in broken links and 
unusable documents or references to internal sites 
and drives. .Distinguish absolute and relative links
 .Path length used should be less than 256 characters 
including .pdf

Documents
Document Specific Tactics 
Hyperlinking The early non-eCTD electronic submissions 
did lack a common structure. Hence, the cross 
referencing was more often needed. Every cross 
reference was to be hyperlinked.  Because of the 
lack of dossier- and document lifecycle, none 
of the hyperlinks would become obsolete in the 
future.The eCTD allows for document replacements in a 
dossier lifecycle. Hence, documents can become 
outdated. Hyperlinks to outdated documents cannot 
be redirected to the replacement files. As a result, 
hyperlinks pointing to an outdated document remain 
active and carry the risks that old data is considered 
current.
Hyperlinking 
StrategyA Regulatory Operations group to create hypertext 
links (hyperlinks) for all cross references within 
and across documents of a regulatory dossier. .Hyperlinks within a document: to be created implicitly 
by the author using the proper features for headings, 
captions, endnotes, footnotes and cross references.
 .Hyperlinks between documents: a syntax to be 
provided by the author of where in the common 
structure the reader can find the referenced 
information. The syntax should be ‘refer to’, followed 
by the CTD title of the destination document. As a 
result, every reader can find the destination document 
in the applied dossier, even without a hyperlink.
 .Nevertheless, to balance the ease of hyperlinks 
and the risk for future obsolete links, the following 
principle can be applied:
1. No hyperlinks to Module 1 documents
2. Deep linking to the named destination in Module 2 
documents
3. No hyperlinks to Module 3 documents
4. Shallow linking to open Module 4 and 5 
documents, provided that the ToC, ToT and ToF 
will bring the reader to the named destination 
using a second click
Use of Colors Colors might be shown differently by the author 
than by the reader. Depending on the PDF version 
of the document and the capability of the browser, 
the colors might be seen as intended.The eCTD defines that the PDF version to be used is at 
least PDF v1.4. 
Format of Tables The format of a table was often not limited to any 
structure, size or color. Which is OK for an on-off 
document. Health Authorities want to copy/paste data in their own 
spreadsheets and databases to run their own analyses. 
Therefore, they have to copy/paste information from 
the document. For them, it is easier to get documents 
from tables than from narratives. The table titles 
and table header have to unambiguously display the 
purpose of the table and the subject. 
Location of 
CaptionsTable captions (titles) are above the table, whereas 
figure captions (titles) are below the figure. This is 
fine for paper articles and journals.In the electronic world, a hyperlink to a figure gets 
the viewer to the caption at the top of the screen. 
Subsequently, the viewer needs to scroll up to see the 
picture. Hence, the figure caption should also be above 
the figure, like for the tables.
Location of 
Tables & FiguresManual page breaks and line breaks are often used 
to move a table/figure and its title and key to the 
next page.Automated position of the table or figure is when the 
object is ‘in line with text’. As a result, upon authoring, it 
flows with the text. Provided that the caption is labelled 
as ‘keep with next’, the caption and object move at the 
same time across pages. The keep with next should 
also be applied for the tables, so an eventual table key 
will also be kept with the table.

Document Specific Tactics 
Units of Measure When documents are written for a particular 
region, the units of measure (SI versus empirical) 
might be accommodated to the receiving country.For common technical documents the SI units of 
measure should be used. Exception is the use of ‘liter’ 
to express volume. Hence, it is not predefined how 
milliliter should be abbreviated (ml or mL). To prevent 
unambiguity between the number 1 and a lowercase l, 
the uppercase L is recommended.
Date The presentation of a date is done in so many 
different ways.ISO has defined a standard notation for a date, namely 
YYYY-MM-DD. Using this, the dates can be included in 
a list and such a list can be chronologically ordered by 
any computer application, even DOS.
Capitalization Capitalization was up to the author. Capitalization of headings are also reflected as such 
in the bookmarks automatically rendered in the PDF. 
Hence, not only the appearance of the capitals in the 
MS-Word document, but also how it was originally 
typed in. For example, the typed text might be a 
combination of lower and upper case and the ‘style’ in 
Word might specify that all are to be in uppercase. As 
a result, the Word document shows all in uppercase, 
while the bookmarks are as it was typed.
This often goes wrong with changing the case to ‘Title 
case”, since in general, words like ‘on’, ‘and’ and ‘the’ 
should not be capitalized. Title case might frustrate 
your carefully written title if it includes terms like ‘eCTD’ 
and mmHg. Hence, the easiest to apply sentence 
case and use the font size or bold to indicate a title or 
specific heading.
Spacing Double spacing was something introduced by 
IBM in its typewriting machines used for paper 
documents.Current text editors, like MS-Word automatically 
apply sufficient spacing between words and between 
sentences. If two words have to remain together use 
nonbreaking spaces or nonbreaking hyphens.
Citing Literature Various ways can be used in documents. For regulatory documents it is recommended to use 
the MS-Word feature for endnotes. Using this feature, a 
list of references is automatically created and even the 
numbering is automatic.
The Bibliographical information should be used in 
accordance with the Vancouver convention.
Document Layout The US required their paper dossiers to come in 
Letter format. The have binders, cupboards and 
copiers designed for Letter format. Similarly, the 
EU had everything designed for A4-formats.For electronic submission, the paper size is not really 
important, because one can zoom in or out, depending 
on the browser and screen one has.
Nevertheless, each document should use the page 
size consistently, so consistently A4 or consistently 
Letter. For mockups of labels, the page size might even 
deviate. 
Margins At one time, the margins had to allow for punch 
holes and scribbling notes or stamping health 
authority information on top.Margins are far less important now. For example, one 
has to have some margin to allow for transport of the 
paper for printing.
Margins of 2.5 cm (0.98”) on all sides has proven to 
be acceptable. This applies for portrait and landscape 
orientation.

Documents
Document Specific Tactics 
Page Numbering At one time, some of the documents started with 
Roman numbering for the first couple of summary 
pages, followed by the Arabic numbering. 
Sometimes the title pages were not numbered, and 
Page 1 was the page following the title page.In the electronic world, the page number is provided by 
the browser. Actually, a page number is therefore no 
longer needed. However, if page numbers are used, they 
should tie to the dynamic structure of the document for 
easy navigation.  
Document 
FormatLong prose documents, with headers and footers 
mostly identical across all submission documents, 
containing contextual information like the brand 
name, complete eCTD section number, Company 
name and sometimes even application number
Scanned PDF documents.
Long prose documents, trying to introduce as 
much knowledge in a single document. Academic 
thinking to repeat in different wording, because 
that adds to the strength of the story. Moreover, 
since the document is believed to be read in its 
own (also outside of the eCTD), a lot of context is 
given with information that has a home in other 
eCTD documents.
Text based: Large blocks of text and complex data 
presentations.Tabular formats for factual information and leave 
the scientific evaluation only in documents assigned 
for that, such as non-clinical and clinical overview, 
Investigator’s Brochures, Pharmaceutical and 
Manufacturing development sections, method 
validation and process validation and nonclinical and 
clinical study report concluding remarks sections. Note 
that even the latter should not cross refer to anything 
outside of this study. By the time the study report will 
be exchanged with the HAs, the scientific overviews will 
put the report in context of the then current thinking.
RPA (Robotic Process Automation) + tabular formats to 
move data.
Short factual information, typical for the expected 
information in a specific eCTD document/section 
only. The context is to be deduced from the collection 
of documents provided in a dossier. Omit long 
sentences and apply the Flesch Reading Ease and/or 
Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level. The latter is not to be done 
frequently, but it reminds authors to the difficulty of 
understanding the narratives.
Visualization:  charts, graphs, and tables to present 
data consistently.
Data Inclusion By 
The AuthorManual copy/paste from data sets, summary 
reports and study reports into the regulatory 
documents. If the statistical analyses obtained 
from development departments can produce 
tables to be copied as a whole, this is preferred, 
but this is not always the case.Future automated population from a database to 
populate tabular formats. Or even better, tabular 
formats the database to generate the according to 
predefined criteria.
Data Extraction 
By HAsManual data extraction from narratives and 
various tables, which both partly describe the 
same information (e.g. test group, treatment, 
etc.). Furthermore, because of the repetition in 
conventional and academic authoring, inconsisten-
cies might occur.Mid-term future: automated data extraction from 
datasets. However, since datasets cannot yet be 
submitted (except for some nonclinical studies and 
clinical studies in the US), PDF version 1.8 or higher 
documents can store tags belonging to the data, 
that can be extracted from the PDF. Tabular formats 
will ease in the PDF documents (current exchange 
standard) the copy and processing.
Readability Storytelling, to introduce repetitive information out 
of courtesy to the reader, not appreciating that the 
reader has the whole dossier to read, so more than 
that particular document only.Providing factual information in tabular formats with 
factual information. Separate scientific evaluations 
are to be documented in separate documents in a 
regulatory dossier such as Non-clinical Overview, 
Clinical Overview, Pharmaceutical Development, 
Process validation and Method validation and 
concluding sections in the nonclinical and clinical study 
reports.

Data Extraction 
By HAsManual data extraction from narratives and 
various tables, which both partly describe the 
same information (e.g. test group, treatment, 
etc.). Furthermore, because of the repetition in 
conventional and academic authoring, inconsisten-
cies might occur.Mid-term future: automated data extraction from 
datasets. However, since datasets cannot yet be 
submitted (except for some nonclinical studies and 
clinical studies in the US), PDF version 1.8 or higher 
documents can store tags belonging to the data, 
that can be extracted from the PDF. Tabular formats 
will ease in the PDF documents (current exchange 
standard) the copy and processing.
Readability Storytelling, to introduce repetitive information out 
of courtesy to the reader, not appreciating that the 
reader has the whole dossier to read, so more than 
that particular document only.Providing factual information in tabular formats with 
factual information. Separate scientific evaluations 
are to be documented in separate documents in a 
regulatory dossier such as Non-clinical Overview, 
Clinical Overview, Pharmaceutical Development, 
Process validation and Method validation and 
concluding sections in the nonclinical and clinical study 
reports.CategoryTraditional Authoring Leading To CTD

Documents
Document Specific Tactics 
Templates Templates with copy-pasting the text from ICH M4 
(originating from 1998), or ICH E3 (originating from 
1996) to be used in electronic CTDs mandated 
since mid 2000’s, to describe the various topics. 
This resulted in detailed introductions, summaries 
and explanations in long narratives, often 
summarizing what is also presented in tables and 
graphs.Templates for tabular unambiguous presentation of 
factual information, thereby ensure the requested 
information will be described (provided) only once and 
once only, without other verbiage.
Context Long introductions in each document to provide 
context to the messages.Contextual information (the purpose of sharing 
this document) to be derived from the cover letter 
and application form of a regulatory application, 
accompanying the various CTD documents.
Formatting Narratives of any kind of structure, suggested by a 
high-level guidance text from 1998.Tabular formats suggesting a long list with potential 
characteristics to be provided, in line with the current 
information on PQ/CMC and IDMP , sometimes even 
beyond that.
Terminology Uncontrolled terminology: free text attribute names 
and attribute values, captured in an unstructured 
narrative.Controlled terminology: direct, straightforward, industry 
standard, and use of controlled vocabularies.
Structure Linear structure: information presented in a 
sequential format.Modular structure: use of headings, sub-headings, 
bullets, tables.
Search Difficult to search and analyze. Simplified search, analysis, and cross-reference.
Template Usage  .Custom creation 
 .Inconsistent document formats .Use of standardized templates tailored to regulatory 
requirements
 .Consistent document formats across submissions
Post-submission, ongoing monitoring and maintenance
Quality Control Emphasis on thorough proofreading and multiple 
quality checks.Prioritizing essential quality checks and leveraging 
real-time feedback to make continuous improvements 
post-publication.
Submission 
Process .Time-consuming manual preparation
 .Multiple versions with inconsistent formats .Automated tools and software for submission
 .Standardized templates for consistency
Regulatory 
Review .Longer review times due to unstructured data
 .Difficulties in data validation .Faster review times with structured, clear data
 .Easier validation with tabular data and clear formats
Review and 
FeedbackLengthy review cycles with multiple rounds of 
feedback, often leading to delays.Continuous feedback loops with regular check-ins 
and audits. Quick iterations based on input from 
stakeholders and audience.

Lean Authoring: Checklist of lean authoring best practices for efficient data exchange In summary, embracing lean authoring practices offers the pharmaceutical industry a 
transformative pathway toward enhanced efficiency, compliance, and patient-centricity. By 
optimizing document creation, streamlining regulatory processes, and fostering collaboration, 
pharmaceutical companies can accelerate time-to-market for innovative therapies and 
ensure robust adherence to global regulatory standards. This approach improves operational 
effectiveness and reduces costs while demonstrating continued commitment to patient safety and 
healthcare quality, ultimately driving advancements that benefit industry stakeholders and patients 
worldwide.
The impact of AI on lean authoring, particularly within the ICH M4Q framework, is transformative, 
acting as a crucial stepping stone from traditional methods to a more advanced, data-driven 
approach. While scientific evaluations currently rely on narrative forms with limited AI involvement, 
the incorporation of factual data in tabular formats or databases is revolutionizing the process. 
This structured data can be efficiently pulled together using AI, enhancing accuracy and 
consistency.
As the industry moves toward AI and automation, it’s important to address the “simple” fixes when 
it comes to lean authoring. Remember, the “target” data representation is easier to achieve when 
it is uniform and tabular. As AI capabilities evolve, these initial steps of integrating AI for data 
collation and analysis lay the groundwork for a future where AI can fully automate and optimize 
the authoring process, ensuring regulatory documents are both comprehensive and compliant, 
ultimately speeding up the approval of new drugs.6. Conclusion
