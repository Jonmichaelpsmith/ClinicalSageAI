GUIDANCE FOR SECTION 11.4.2 - STATISTICAL/ANALYTICAL ISSUES AND
APPENDIX 16.1.9 ............................................ Annex VIII

This guideline was developed within the Expert Working Group (Efficacy) of the International Conference on1
Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) and has been
subject to consultation by the regulatory parties, in accordance with the ICH process.  This document has been endorsed
by the ICH Steering Committee at Step 4  of the ICH process, November 29, 1995.  At Step 4  of the process, the final
draft is recommended for adoption to the regulatory bodies of the European Union, Japan and the USA.  This guideline
was published in the  Federal Register  on July 17, 1996 (61 FR 37320) and is applicable to drug and biological
products.  Although this guideline does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind
FDA or the industry, it does represent the Agency’s current thinking on structure and content of clincial study reports.

STRUCTURE AND CONTENT OF CLINICAL STUDY REPORTS
TABLE OF CONTENTS
INTRODUCTION
The objective of this guideline is to facilitate the compilation of a single core clinical study report
acceptable to all regulatory authorities of the ICH regions. The regulatory authority-specific
additions will consist of modules to be considered as appendices, available upon request according
to regional regulatory requirements.
The clinical study report described in this guideline is an “integrated” full report of an individual
study of any therapeutic, prophylactic, or diagnostic agent (referred to herein as drug or
treatment) conducted in patients. The clinical and statistical description, presentations, and
analyses are integrated into a single report, incorporating tables and figures into the main text of
the report or at the end of the text, with appendices containing such information as the protocol,
sample case report forms, investigator-related information, information related to the test
drugs/investigational products including active control/comparators, technical statistical
documentation, related publications, patient data listings, and technical statistical details such as
derivations, computations, analyses,and computer output. The integrated full report of a study
should not be derived by simply joining a separate clinical and statistical report. Although this
guideline is mainly aimed at efficacy and safety trials, the basic principles and structure described
can be applied to other kinds of trials, such as clinical pharmacology studies. Depending on the
nature and importance of such studies, a less detailed report might be appropriate.
The guideline is intended to assist sponsors in the development of a report that is complete, free
from ambiguity, well organized, and easy to review. The report should provide a clear explanation

2of how the critical design features of the study were chosen and enough information on the plan,
methods, and conduct of the study so that there is no ambiguity in how the study was carried out.
The report with its appendices should also provide enough individual patient data, including the
demographic and baseline data, and details of analytical methods, to allow replication of the
critical analyses when authorities wish to do so. It is also particularly important that all analyses,
tables, and figures carry, in text or as part of the table, clear identification of the set of patients
from which they were generated.
Depending on the regulatory authority's review policy, abbreviated reports using summarized data
or with some sections deleted may be acceptable for uncontrolled studies or other studies not
designed to establish efficacy, for seriously flawed or aborted studies, or for controlled studies
that examine conditions clearly unrelated to those for which a claim is made. A controlled safety
study, however, should be reported in full. If an abbreviated report is provided, a full description
of safety aspects should be included in all cases. If an abbreviated report is submitted, there should
be enough detail of design and results to allow the regulatory authority to determine whether a
full report is needed. If there is any question regarding whether the reports are needed, it may be
useful to consult the regulatory authority.
In presenting the detailed description of how the study was carried out, it may be possible simply
to restate the description in the initial protocol. Often, however, it is possible to present the
methodology of the study more concisely in a separate document. In each section describing the
design and conduct of the study, it is particularly important to clarify features of the study that are
not well-described in the protocol and identify ways in which the study as conducted differed from
the protocol, and to discuss the statistical methods and analyses used to account for these
deviations from the planned protocol.
The full integrated report of the individual study should include the most detailed discussion of
individual adverse events or laboratory abnormalities, but these should usually be reexamined as
part of an overall safety analysis of all available data in any application.
The report should describe demographic and other potentially predictive characteristics of the
study population and, where the study is large enough to permit this, present data for
demographic (e.g., age, sex, race, weight) and other (e.g., renal or hepatic function) subgroups so
that possible differences in efficacy or safety can be identified. Usually, however, subgroup
responses should be examined in the larger data base used in the overall analysis.
The data listings requested as part of the report (usually in an appendix) are those needed to
support critical analyses. Data listings that are part of the report should be readily usable by the
reviewer. Thus, although it may be desirable to include many variables in a single listing to limit
size, this should not be at the expense of clarity. An excess of data should not be allowed to lead
to, for example, overuse of symbols instead of words or easily understood abbreviations, or to
too-small displays. In this case, it is preferable to produce several listings.

3Data should be presented in the report at different levels of detail: Overall summary figures and
tables for important demographic, efficacy, and safety variables may be placed in the text to
illustrate important points; other summary figures, tables, and listings for demographic, efficacy,
and safety variables should be provided in section 14; individual patient data for specified groups
of patients should be provided as listings in Appendix 16.2; and all individual patient data
(archival listings requested only in the United States) should be provided in Appendix 16.4.
In any table, figure, or data listing, estimated or derived values, if used, should be identified in a
conspicuous fashion. Detailed explanations should be provided as to how such values were
estimated or derived and what underlying assumptions were made.
The guidance provided below is detailed and is intended to notify the applicant of virtually all of
the information that should routinely be provided so that postsubmission requests for further data
clarification and analyses can be reduced as much as possible. Nonetheless, specific requirements
for data presentation and/or analysis may depend on specific situations, may evolve over time,
may vary from drug class to drug class, may differ among regions, and cannot be described in
general terms. It is, therefore, important to refer to specific clinical guidelines and to discuss data
presentation and analyses with the reviewing authority, whenever possible. Detailed written
guidance on statistical approaches is available from some authorities.
Each report should consider all of the topics described (unless clearly not relevant) although the
specific sequence and grouping of topics may be changed if alternatives are more logical for a
particular study. Some data in the appendices are specific requirements of individual regulatory
authorities and should be submitted as appropriate. The numbering should then be adapted
accordingly.
In the case of very large trials, some of the provisions of this guideline may be impractical or
inappropriate. When planning and when reporting such trials, contact with regulatory authorities
to discuss an appropriate report format is encouraged.
The provisions of this guideline should be used in conjunction with other ICH guidelines.

should be provided in Appendix 16.1.5.
7. INTRODUCTION
The introduction should contain a brief statement (maximum: one page) placing the study in the
context of the development of the test drug/investigational product, relating the critical features of
the study (e.g., rationale and aims, target population, treatment, duration, primary endpoints) to
that development. Any guidelines that were followed in the development of the protocol or any
other agreements/meetings between the sponsor/company and regulatory authorities that are
relevant to the particular study should be identified or described.
8. STUDY OBJECTIVES
A statement describing the overall purpose(s) of the study should be provided.
9. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan: Description
The overall study plan and design (configuration) of the study (e.g., parallel, cross-over)
should be described briefly but clearly, using charts and diagrams as needed. If other

7studies used a very similar protocol, it may be useful to note this and describe any
important differences. The actual protocol and any changes should be included as
Appendix 16.1.1 and a sample case report form (unique pages only; i.e., it is not necessary
to include identical pages from forms for different evaluations or visits) as Appendix
16.1.2. If any of the information in this section comes from sources other than the
protocol, these should be identified.
The information provided should include:
Treatments studied (specific drugs, doses, and procedures).
Patient population studied and the number of patients to be included.
Level and method of blinding/masking (e.g., open, double-blind, single-blind,
blinded evaluators, and unblinded patients and/or investigators).
Kind of control(s) (e.g., placebo, no treatment, active drug, dose-response,
historical) and study configuration (parallel, cross-over).
Method of assignment to treatment (randomization, stratification).
Sequence and duration of all study periods, including prerandomization and
post-treatment periods, therapy withdrawal periods, and single and double-blind
treatment periods. When patients were randomized should be specified. It is
usually helpful to display the design graphically with a flow chart that includes
timing of assessments (see Annexes IIIa and IIIb for an example).
 Any safety, data monitoring, or special steering or evaluation committees.
Any interim analyses.
9.2 Discussion of Study Design, Including the Choice of Control Groups
The specific control chosen and the study design used should be discussed, as necessary.
Examples of design issues meriting discussion follow.
Generally, the control (comparison) groups that are recognized are placebo concurrent
control, no treatment concurrent control, active treatment concurrent control, dose
comparison concurrent control, and historical control. In addition to the type of control,
other critical design features that may need discussion are use of a cross-over design and
selection of patients with particular prior history, such as response or nonresponse to a
specific drug or member of a drug class. If randomization was not used, it is important to
explain how other techniques, if any, guarded against systematic selection bias.

8   
Known or potential problems associated with the study design or control group chosen
should be discussed in light of the specific disease and therapies being studied. For a
cross-over design, for example, there should be consideration, among other things, of the
likelihood of spontaneous change in the disease and of carry-over effects of treatment
during the study.
If efficacy was to be demonstrated by showing equivalence, i.e., the absence of a specified
degree of inferiority of the new treatment compared to an established treatment, problems
associated with such study designs should be addressed. Specifically, there should be
provided a basis for considering the study capable of distinguishing active from inactive
therapy. Support may be provided by an analysis of previous studies similar to the present
study with respect to important design characteristics (e.g., patient selection, study
endpoints, duration, dose of active control, concomitant therapy) showing a consistent
ability to demonstrate superiority of the active control to placebo. How to assess the
ability of the present study to distinguish effective from ineffective therapy should also be
discussed. For example, it may be possible to identify a treatment response (based on past
studies) that would clearly distinguish between the treated population and an untreated
group. Such a response could be the change of a measure from baseline or some other
specified outcome like healing rate or survival rate. Attainment of such a response would
support the expectation that the study could have distinguished the active drug from an
inactive drug. There should also be a discussion of the degree of inferiority of the therapy
(often referred to as the delta value) the study was intended to show was not exceeded.
The limitations of historical controls are well known (e.g., difficulty of assuring
comparability of treated groups, inability to blind investigators to treatment, change in
therapy/disease, difference due to placebo effect) and deserve particular attention.
Other specific features of the design may also deserve discussion, including presence or
absence of washout periods and the duration of the treatment period, especially for a
chronic illness. The rationale for dose and dose-interval selection should be explained, if it
is not obvious. For example, once daily dosing with a short half-life drug whose effect is
closely related in time to blood level is not usually effective; if the study design uses such
dosing, this should be explained, e.g., by pointing to pharmacodynamic evidence that
effect is prolonged compared to blood levels. The procedures used to seek evidence of
“escape” from drug effect at the end of the dose-interval, such as measurements of effect
just before dosing, should be described. Similarly, in a parallel design dose-response study,
the choice of doses should be explained.
9.3 Selection of Study Population
9.3.1 Inclusion Criteria
The patient population and the selection criteria used to enter the patients into the

9study should be described, and the suitability of the population for the purposes of
the study discussed. Specific diagnostic criteria used, as well as specific
disease(e.g., disease of a particular severity or duration, results of a particular test
or rating scale(s) or physical examination, particular features of clinical history,
such as failure or success on prior therapy, or other potential prognostic factors
and any age, sex, or ethnic factors) should be presented.
Screening criteria and any additional criteria for randomization or entry into the
test drug/investigational product treatment part of the trial should be described. If
there is reason to believe that there were additional entry criteria, not defined in the
protocol, the implications of these should be discussed. For example, some
investigators may have excluded or entered into other studies patients who were
particularly ill or who had particular baseline characteristics.
9.3.2 Exclusion Criteria
The criteria for exclusion at entry into the study should be specified and the
rationale provided (e.g., safety concerns, administrative reasons, or lack of
suitability for the trial). The impact of exclusions on the generalizability of the
study should be discussed in section 13 of the study report or in an overview of
safety and efficacy.
9.3.3 Removal of Patients From Therapy or Assessment
The predetermined reasons for removing patients from therapy or assessment
observation, if any, should be described, as should the nature and duration of any
planned followup observations in those patients.
9.4 Treatments
9.4.1 Treatments Administered
The precise treatments or diagnostic agents to be administered in each arm of the
study, and for each period of the study, should be described including route and
mode of administration, dose, and dosage schedule.
9.4.2 Identity of Investigational Products(s)
In the text of the report, a brief description of the test drug(s)/investigational
product(s) (formulation, strength, batch number(s)) should be given. If more than
one batch of test drug/investigational product was used, patients receiving each
batch should be identified in Appendix 16.1.6.

10The source of placebos and active control/comparator product(s) should be
provided. Any modification of comparator product(s) from their usual commercial
state should be noted, and the steps taken to assure that their bioavailability was
unaltered should be described.
For long-duration trials of investigational products with limited shelf-lives or
incomplete stability data, the logistics of resupply of the materials should be
described. Any use of test materials past their expiry date should be noted, and
patients receiving them identified. If there were specific storage requirements,
these should also be described.
9.4.3 Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups
The specific methods used to assign patients to treatment groups, e.g., centralized
allocation, allocation within sites, adaptive allocation (that is, assignment on the
basis of earlier assignment or outcome) should be described in the text of the
report, including any stratification or blocking procedures. Any unusual features
should be explained.
A detailed description of the randomization method, including how it was
executed, should be given in Appendix 16.1.7 with references cited if necessary. A
table exhibiting the randomization codes, patient identifier, and treatment assigned
should also be presented in the Appendix. For a multicenter study, the information
should be given by center. The method of generating random numbers should be
explained.
For a historically controlled trial, it is important to explain how the particul ar
control was selected and what other historical experiences were examined, if any,
and how their results compared to the control used.
9.4.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
The doses or dose ranges used in the study should be given for all treatments and
the basis for choosing them described (e.g., prior experience in humans, animal
data).
9.4.5 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient
Procedures for selecting each patient's dose of test drug/ investigational product
and active control/comparator should be described. These procedures can vary
from simple random assignment to a selected fixed drug/dose regimen, to use of a
specified titration procedure, or to more elaborate response-determined selection
procedures, e.g., where dose is titrated upward at intervals until intolerance or

11some specified endpoint is achieved. Procedures for back-titration, if any, should
also be described.
The timing (time of day, interval) of dosing and the relation of dosing to meals
should be described and, if timing was not specified, this should be noted.
Any specific instructions to patients about when or how to take the dose(s) should
be described.
9.4.6 Blinding
A description of the specific procedures used to carry out blinding should be
provided (e.g., how bottles were labeled, use of labels that reveal blind-breakage,
sealed code list/envelopes, double dummy techniques), including the circumstances
in which the blind would be broken for an individual or for all patients (e.g., for
serious adverse events), the procedures used to do this, and who had access to
patient codes. If the study allowed for some investigators to remain unblinded
(e.g., to allow them to adjust medication), the means of shielding other
investigators should be explained. Measures taken to ensure that test
drug/investigational product and placebo were indistinguishable and evidence that
they were indistinguishable should be described, as should the appearance, shape,
smell, and taste of the test material. Measures to prevent unblinding by laboratory
measurements, if used, should be described. If there was a data monitoring
committee with access to unblinded data, procedures to ensure maintenance of
overall study blinding should be described. The procedure used to maintain the
blinding when interim analyses were performed should also be explained.
If blinding was considered unnecessary to reduce bias for some or all of the
observations, this should be explained; e.g., use of a random-zero
sphygmomanometer eliminates possible observer bias in reading blood pressure
and Holter tapes are often read by automated systems that are presumably immune
to observer bias. If blinding was considered desirable but not feasible, the reasons
and implications should be discussed. Sometimes blinding is attempted but is
known to be imperfect because of obvious drug effects in at least some patients
(dry mouth, bradycardia, fever, injection site reactions, changes in laboratory data).
Such problems or potential problems should be identified and, if there were any
attempts to assess the magnitude of the problem or manage it (e.g., by having
endpoint measurements carried out by people shielded from information that might
reveal treatment assignment), they should be described.
9.4.7 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
Which drugs or procedures were allowed before and during the study, whether and

12how their use was recorded, and any other specific rules and procedures related to
permitted or prohibited concomitant therapy should be described. How allowed
concomitant therapy might affect the outcome due either to drug-drug interaction
or to direct effects on the study endpoints should be discussed, and how the
independent effects of concomitant and study therapies could be ascertained
should be explained.
9.4.8 Treatment Compliance
The measures taken to ensure and document treatment compliance should be
described, e.g., drug accountability, diary cards, blood, urine or other body fluid
drug level measurements, or medication event monitoring.
9.5 Efficacy and Safety Variables
9.5.1 Efficacy and Safety Measurements Assessed and Flow Chart
The specific efficacy and safety variables to be assessed and laboratory tests to be
conducted, their schedule (days of study, time of day, relation to meals, and the
timing of critical measures in relation to test drug administration, e.g., just prior to
next dose, 2 hours after dose), the methods for measuring them, and the persons
responsible for the measurements should be described. If there were changes in
personnel carrying out critical measurements, these should be reported.
It is usually helpful to display graphically in a flow chart (see Annex III of the
guideline) the frequency and timing of efficacy and safety measurements; visit
numbers and times should be shown, or, alternatively, times alone can be used
(visit numbers alone are more difficult to interpret). Any specific instructions (e.g.,
guidance or use of a diary) to the patients should also be noted.
Any definitions used to characterize outcome (e.g., criteria for determining
occurrence of acute myocardial infarction, designation of the location of the
infarction, characterization of a stroke as thrombotic or hemorrhagic, distinction
between TIA and stroke, assignment of cause of death) should be explained in full.
Any techniques used to standardize or compare results of laboratory tests or other
clinical measurements (e.g., ECG, chest X-ray) should also be described.  This is
particularly important in multicenter studies.
If anyone other than the investigator was responsible for evaluation of clinical
outcomes (e.g., the sponsor or an external committee to review X-rays or ECG's
or to determine whether the patient had a stroke, acute infarction, or sudden
death), the person or group should be identified. The procedures used, including
means of maintaining blindness and centralizing readings and measurements,

13should be described fully.
The means of obtaining adverse event data should be described (volunteered,
checklist, or questioning), as should any specific rating scale(s) used and any
specifically planned followup procedures for adverse events or any planned
rechallenge procedure.
Any rating of adverse events by the investigator, sponsor, or external group (e.g.,
rating by severity or likelihood of drug causation) should be described. The criteria
for such ratings, if any, should be given and the parties responsible for the ratings
should be clearly identified. If efficacy or safety was to be assessed in terms of
categorical ratings or numerical scores, the criteria used for point assignment
should be provided (e.g., definitions of point scores). For multicenter studies, how
methods were standardized should be indicated.
9.5.2 Appropriateness of Measurements
If any of the efficacy or safety assessments was not standard, i.e., widely used and
generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant (able to discriminate
between effective and ineffective agents), its reliability, accuracy, and relevance
should be documented. It may be helpful to describe alternatives considered but
rejected.
If a surrogate endpoint (a laboratory measurement or physical measurement or sign
that is not a direct measure of clinical benefit) was used as a study endpoint, this
should be justified, e.g., by reference to clinical data, publications, guidelines, or
previous actions by regulatory authorities.
9.5.3 Primary Efficacy Variable(s)
The primary measurements and endpoints used to determine efficacy should be
clearly specified. Although the critical efficacy measurements may seem obvious,
when there are multiple variables or when variables are measured repeatedly, the
protocol should identify the primary ones with an explanation of why they were
chosen, or designate the pattern of significant findings or other method of
combining information that would be interpreted as supporting efficacy.
If the protocol did not identify the primary variables, the study report should
explain how these critical variables were selected (e.g., by reference to
publications, guidelines, or previous actions by regulatory authorities) and when
they were identified (i.e., before or after the study was completed and unblinded).
If an efficacy threshold was defined in the protocol, this should be described.

149.5.4 Drug Concentration Measurements
Any drug concentrations to be measured and the sample collection times and
periods in relation to the timing of drug administration should be described. Any
relation of drug administration and sampling to ingestion of food, posture, and the
possible effects of concomitant medication/alcohol/ caffeine/nicotine should also be
addressed. The biological sample measured, the handling of samples and the
method of measurement used should be described, referring to published and/or
internal assay validation documentation for methodological details. Where other
factors are believed important in assessing pharmacokinetics (e.g., soluble
circulating receptors, renal or hepatic function), the timing and plans to measure
these factors should also be specified.
9.6 Data Quality Assurance
The quality assurance and quality control systems implemented to assure the quality of the
data should be described in brief. If none were used, this should be stated. Documentation
of inter-laboratory standardization methods and quality assurance procedures, if used,
should be provided under Appendix 16.1.10.
Any steps taken at the investigation site or centrally to ensure the use of standard
terminology and the collection of accurate, consistent, complete, and reliable data, such as
training sessions, monitoring of investigators by sponsor personnel, instruction manuals,
data verification, cross-checking, use of a central laboratory for certain tests, centralized
ECG reading, or data audits, should be described. It should be noted whether investigator
meetings or other steps were taken to prepare investigators and standardize performance.
If the sponsor used an independent internal or external auditing procedure, it should be
mentioned here and described in Appendix 16.1.8; audit certificates, if available, should be
provided in the same appendix.
9.7 Statistical Methods Planned in the Protocol and Determination of Sample 
Size
9.7.2 Statistical and Analytical Plans
The statistical analyses planned in the protocol and any changes made before
outcome results were available should be described. In this section, emphasis
should be on which analyses, comparisons, and statistical tests were planned, not
on which ones were actually used. If critical measurements were made more than
once, the particular measurements (e.g., average of several measurements over the
entire study, values at particular times, values only from study completers, or last
on-therapy value) planned as the basis for comparison of test drug/investigational
product and control should be specified. Similarly, if more than one analytical

15approach is plausible, e.g., changes from baseline response, slope analysis,
life-table analysis, the planned approach should be identified. Also, whether the
primary analysis is to include adjustment for covariates should be specified.
If there were any planned reasons for excluding from analysis patients for whom
data are available, these should be described. If there were any subgroups whose
results were to be examined separately, these should be identified. If categorical
responses (global scales, severity scores, responses of a certain size) were to be
used in analyzing responses, they should be clearly defined.
Planned monitoring of the results of the study should be described. If there was a
data monitoring committee, either within or outside the sponsor's control, its
composition and operating procedures should be described and procedures to
maintain study blinding should be given. The frequency and nature of any planned
interim analysis, any specified circumstances in which the study would be
terminated, and any statistical adjustments to be employed because of interim
analyses should be described.
9.7.2 Determination of Sample Size
The planned sample size and the basis for it, such as statistical considerations or
practical limitations, should be provided. Methods for sample size calculation
should be given together with their derivations or source of reference. Estimates
used in the calculations should be given, and explanations should be provided as to
how they were obtained. For a study intended to show a difference between
treatments, the difference the study is designed to detect should be specified. For a
positive control study intended to show that a new therapy is at least as effective
as the standard therapy, the sample size determination should specify the difference
between treatments that would be considered unacceptably large and, therefore,
the difference the study is designed to be able to exclude.
9.8 Changes in the Conduct of the Study or Planned Analyses
Any change in the conduct of the study or planned analyses (e.g., dropping a treatment
group, changing the entry criteria or drug dosages, adjusting the sample size) instituted
after the start of the study should be described. The time(s) and reason(s) for the
change(s), the procedure used to decide on the change(s), the person(s) or group(s)
responsible for the change(s) and the nature and content of the data available (and to
whom they were available) when the change was made should also be described, whether
the change was documented as a formal protocol amendment or not. Personnel changes
need not be included. Any possible implications of the change(s) for the interpretation of
the study should be discussed briefly in this section and more fully in other appropriate
sections of the report. In every section of the report, a clear distinction between conditions

16(procedures) planned in the protocol and amendments or additions should be made. In
general, changes in planned analyses made prior to breaking the blind have limited
implications for study interpretation. It is therefore particularly critical that the timing of
changes relative to blind breaking and availability of outcome results be well characterized.
10. STUDY PATIENTS
10.1 Disposition of Patients
There should be a clear accounting of all patients who entered the study, using figures or
tables in the text of the report. The numbers of patients who were randomized and who
entered and completed each phase of the study (or each week/month of the study) should
be provided, as well as the reasons for all postrandomization discontinuations, grouped by
treatment and by major reason (e.g., lost to followup, adverse event, poor compliance). It
may also be relevant to provide the number of patients screened for inclusion and a
breakdown of the reasons for excluding patients during screening, if this could help clarify
the appropriate patient population for eventual drug use. A flow chart is often helpful (see
Annexes IVa and IVb for examples). Whether patients are followed for the duration of the
study, even if drug is discontinued, should be made clear.
In Appendix 16.2.1, there should also be a listing of all patients discontinued from the
study after enrollment, broken down by center and treatment group, giving a patient
identifier, the specific reason for discontinuation, the treatment (drug and dose),
cumulative dose (where appropriate), and the duration of treatment before
discontinuation. Whether or not the blind for the patient was broken at the time of
discontinuation should be noted. It may also be useful to include other information, such
as critical demographic data (e.g., age, sex, race), concomitant medication, and the major
response variable(s) at termination. See Annex V for an example of such a listing.
10.2 Protocol Deviations
All important deviations related to study inclusion or exclusion criteria, conduct of the
trial, patient managements or patient assessment should be described.
In the body of the text, protocol deviations should be appropriately summarized by center
and grouped into different categories, such as:
Those who entered the study even though they did not satisfy the entry criteria.
Those who developed withdrawal criteria during the study but were not
withdrawn.
Those who received the wrong treatment or incorrect dose.

17Those who received an excluded concomitant treatment.
In Appendix 16.2.2, individual patients with these protocol deviations should be listed,
broken down by center for multicenter studies.
11. EFFICACY EVALUATION
11.1 Data Sets Analyzed
Exactly which patients were included in each efficacy analysis should be precisely defined,
e.g., all patients receiving any test drugs/investigational products, all patients with any
efficacy observation or with a certain minimum number of observations, only patients
completing the trial, all patients with an observation during a particular time window, or
only patients with a specified degree of compliance. It should be clear, if not defined in the
study protocol, when (relative to study unblinding) and how inclusion/exclusion criteria
for the data sets analyzed were developed. Generally, even if the applicant's proposed
primary analysis is based on a reduced subset of the patients with data, there should also
be, for any trial intended to establish efficacy, an additional analysis using all randomized
(or otherwise entered) patients with any on-treatment data.
There should be a tabular listing of all patients, visits, and observations excluded from the
efficacy analysis provided in Appendix 16.2.3 (see Annex VI for an example). The reasons
for exclusions should also be analyzed for the whole treatment group over time (see
Annex VII for an example).
11.2 Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics
Group data for the critical demographic and baseline characteristics of the patients, as well
as other factors arising during the study that could affect response, should be presented in
this section and comparability of the treatment groups for all relevant characteristics
should be displayed by use of tables or graphs in section 14.1. The data for the patient
sample included in the “all patients with data” analysis should be given first. This may be
followed by data on other groups used in principal analyses, such as the “per-protocol”
analysis or other analyses, e.g., groups defined by compliance, concomitant
disease/therapy, or demographic/baseline characteristics. When such groups are used, data
for the complementary excluded group should also be shown. In a multicenter study,
where appropriate, comparability should be assessed by center, and centers should be
compared.
A diagram showing the relationship between the entire sample and any other analysis
groups should be provided.
The critical variables will depend on the specific nature of the disease and on the protocol

18but will usually include:
Demographic variables:
- Age
- Sex
    - Race
Disease factors:
- Specific entry criteria (if not uniform), duration, stage and severity of disease,
and other clinical classifications and subgroupings in common usage or of known
prognostic significance.
- Baseline values for critical clinical measurements carried out during the study or
identified as important indicators of prognosis or response to therapy.
- Concomitant illness at trial initiation, such as renal disease, diabetes, heart failure.
- Relevant previous illness.
- Relevant previous treatment for illness treated in the study.
- Concomitant treatment maintained, even if the dose was changed during the
study, including oral contraceptive and hormone replacement therapy; treatments
stopped at entry into the study period (or changed at study initiation).
Other factors that might affect response to therapy (e.g., weight, renin status,
antibody levels, metabolic status).
Other possibly relevant variables (e.g., smoking, alcohol intake, special diets) and,
for women, menstrual status and date of last menstrual period, if pertinent for the
study.
In addition to tables and graphs giving group data for these baseline variables, relevant
individual patient demographic and baseline data, including laboratory values, and all
concomitant medication for all individual patients randomized (broken down by treatment
and by center for multicenter studies) should be presented in by-patient tabular listings in
Appendix 16.2.4. Although some regulatory authorities will require all baseline data to be
presented elsewhere in tabular listings, the Appendix to the study report should be limited
to only the most relevant data, generally the variables listed above.
11.3. Measurements of Treatment Compliance
Any measurements of compliance of individual patients with the treatment regimen under
study and drug concentrations in body fluids should be summarized, analyzed by treatment
group and time interval, and tabulated in Appendix 16.2.5.
11.4 Efficacy Results and Tabulations of Individual Patient Data

1911.4.1 Analysis of Efficacy
Treatment groups should be compared for all critical measures of efficacy (primary
and secondary endpoints; any pharmacodynamic endpoints studied), as well as
benefit/risk assessment(s) in each patient where these are utilized. In general, the
results of all analyses contemplated in the protocol and an analysis including all
patients with on-study data should be performed in studies intended to establish
efficacy. The analysis should show the size (point estimate) of the difference
between the treatments, the associated confidence interval, and, where utilized, the
results of hypothesis testing.
Analyses based on continuous variables (e.g., mean blood pressure or depression
scale score) and categorical responses (e.g., cure of an infection) can be equally
valid; ordinarily both should be presented if both were planned and are available. If
categories are newly created (i.e., not in the statistical plan) the basis for them
should be explained. Even if one variable receives primary attention (e.g., in a
blood pressure study, supine blood pressure at week “x”), other reasonable
measures (e.g., standing blood pressure and blood pressures at other particular
times) should be assessed, at least briefly. In addition, the time course of response
should be described, if possible. For a multicenter study, where appropriate, data
display and analysis of individual centers should be included for critical variables to
give a clear picture of the results at each site, especially the larger sites.
If any critical measurements or assessments of efficacy or safety outcomes were
made by more than one party (e.g., both the investigator and an expert committee
may offer an opinion on whether a patient had an acute infarction), overall
differences between the ratings should be shown, and each patient having disparate
assessments should be identified. The assessments used should be clear in all
analyses.
In many cases, efficacy and safety endpoints are difficult to distinguish (e.g., deaths
in a fatal disease study). Many of the principles addressed below should be adopted
for critical safety measures as well.
11.4.2 Statistical/Analytical Issues
The statistical analysis used should be described for clinical and statistical
reviewers in the text of the report, with detailed documentation of statistical
methods (see Annex IX) presented in Appendix 16.1.9. Important features of the
analysis, including the particular methods used, adjustments made for demographic
or baseline measurements or concomitant therapy, handling of dropouts and
missing data, adjustments for multiple comparisons, special analyses of multicenter
studies, and adjustments for interim analyses, should be discussed. Any changes in

20the analysis made after blind-breaking should be identified.
In addition to the general discussion, the following specific issues should be
addressed (unless not applicable):
11.4.2.1 Adjustments for Covariates
Selection of, and adjustments for, demographic or baseline measurements,
concomitant therapy, or any other covariates or prognostic factors should
be explained in the report, and methods of adjustment, results of analyses,
and supportive information (e.g., ANCOVA or Cox regression output)
should be included in the detailed documentation of statistical methods. If
the covariates or methods used in these analyses differed from those
planned in the protocol, the differences should be explained and, where
possible and relevant, the results of planned analyses should also be
presented. Although not part of the individual study report, comparisons of
covariate adjustments and prognostic factors across individual studies may
be an informative analysis in a summary of clinical efficacy data.
11.4.2.2 Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data
There are several factors that may affect dropout rates. These include the
duration of the study, the nature of the disease, the efficacy and toxicity of
the drug under study, and other factors that are not therapy-related.
Ignoring the patients who dropped out of the study and drawing
conclusions based only on patients who completed the study can be
misleading. A large number of dropouts, however, even if included in an
analysis, may introduce bias, particularly if there are more early dropouts in
one treatment group or the reasons for dropping out are treatment or
outcome related. Although the effects of early dropouts, and sometimes
even the direction of bias, can be difficult to determine, possible effects
should be explored as fully as possible. It may be helpful to examine the
observed cases at various times or, if dropouts were very frequent, to
concentrate on analyses at times when most of the patients were still under
observation and when the full effect of the drug was realized. It may also
be helpful to examine modeling approaches to the evaluation of such
incomplete data sets.
The results of a clinical trial should be assessed not only for the subset of
patients who completed the study, but also for the entire patient population
as randomized or at least for all those with any on-study measurements.

21Several factors should be considered and compared for the treatment
groups in analyzing the effects of dropouts: The reasons for the dropouts,
the time to dropout, and the proportion of dropouts among treatment
groups at various time points.
Procedures for dealing with missing data, e.g., use of estimated or derived
data, should be described. Detailed explanation should be provided as to
how such estimations or derivations were done and what underlying
assumptions were made.
11.4.2.3 Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring
The process of examining and analyzing data accumulating in a clinical
trial, either formally or informally, can introduce bias and/or increase type I
error. Therefore, all interim analyses, formal or informal, preplanned or ad
hoc, by any study participant, sponsor staff member, or data monitoring
group should be described in full, even if the treatment groups were not
identified. The need for statistical adjustment because of such analyses
should be addressed. Any operating instructions or procedures used for
such analyses should be described. The minutes of meetings of any data
monitoring group and any data reports reviewed at those meetings,
particularly a meeting that led to a change in the protocol or early
termination of the study, may be helpful and should be provided in
Appendix 16.1.9. Data monitoring without code-breaking should also be
described, even if this kind of monitoring is considered to cause no increase
in type I error.
11.4.2.4 Multicenter Studies
A multicenter study is a single study under a common protocol, involving
several centers (e.g., clinics, practices, hospitals) where the data collected
are intended to be analyzed as a whole (as opposed to a post-hoc decision
to combine data or results from separate studies). Individual center results
should be presented, however, where appropriate, e.g., when the centers
have sufficient numbers of patients to make such analysis potentially
valuable, the possibility of qualitative or quantitative treatment-by-center
interaction should be explored. Any extreme or opposite results among
centers should be noted and discussed, considering such possibilities as
differences in study conduct, patient characteristics, or clinical settings.
Treatment comparison should include analyses that allow for center
differences with respect to response. If appropriate, demographic, baseline,
and postbaseline data, as well as efficacy data, should be presented by
center, even though the combined analysis is the primary one.

2211.4.2.5 Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity
False/positive findings increase in number as the number of significance
tests (number of comparisons) performed increases. If there was more than
one primary endpoint (outcome variable) or more than one analysis of
particular endpoint, or if there were multiple treatment groups or subsets of
the patient population being examined, the statistical analysis should reflect
awareness of this and either explain the statistical adjustment used for type
I error criteria or give reasons why it was considered unnecessary.
11.4.2.6 Use of an “Efficacy Subset” of Patients
Particular attention should be devoted to the effects of dropping patients
with available data from analyses because of poor compliance, missed
visits, ineligibility, or any other reason. As noted above, an analysis using
all available data should be carried out for all studies intended to establish
efficacy, even if it is not the analysis proposed as the primary analysis by
the applicant. In general, it is advantageous to demonstrate robustness of
the principal trial conclusions with respect to alternative choices of patient
populations for analysis. Any substantial differences resulting from the
choice of patient population for analysis should be the subject of explicit
discussion.
11.4.2.7 Active-Control Studies Intended to Show Equivalence
If an active control study is intended to show equivalence (i.e., lack of a
difference greater than a specified size) between the test
drug/investigational product and the active control/comparator, the analysis
should show the confidence interval for the comparison between the two
agents for critical endpoints and the relation of that interval to the
prespecified degree of inferiority that would be considered unacceptable.
(See section 9.2 for important considerations when using the active control
equivalence design.)
11.4.2.8 Examination of Subgroups
If the size of the study permits, important demographic or baseline
value-defined subgroups should be examined for unusually large or small
responses and the results presented, e.g., comparison of effects by age, sex,
or race; by severity or prognostic groups; and by history of prior treatment
with a drug of the same class. If these analyses were not carried out
because the study was too small, it should be noted. These analyses are not
intended to “salvage” an otherwise nonsupportive study but may suggest

23hypotheses worth examining in other studies or be helpful in refining
labeling information, patient selection, or dose selection. Where there is a
prior hypothesis of a differential effect in a particular subgroup, this
hypothesis and its assessment should be part of the planned statistical
analysis.
11.4.3 Tabulation of Individual Response Data
In addition to tables and graphs representing group data, individual response data
and other relevant study information should be presented in tables. Some
regulatory authorities may require all individual data in archival case report
tabulations. What needs to be included in the report will vary from study to study
and from one drug class to another, and the applicant must decide, if possible after
consultation with the regulatory authority, what to include in an Appendix to the
study report. The study report should indicate what material is included as an
Appendix, what is in the more extensive archival case report tabulations, if
required by the regulatory authority, and what is available on request.
For a controlled study in which critical efficacy measurements or assessments (e.g.,
blood or urine cultures, pulmonary function tests, angina frequency, or global
evaluations) are repeated at intervals, the data listings accompanying the report
should include, for each patient, a patient identifier, all measured or observed
values of critical measurements, including baseline measurements, with notation of
the time during the study (e.g., days on therapy and time of day, if relevant) when
the measurements were made, the drug/dose at the time (if useful, given as
milligram per kilogram (mg/kg)), any measurements of compliance, and any
concomitant medications at the time of, or close to the time of, measurement or
assessment. If, aside from repeated assessments, the study included some overall
responder versus nonresponder evaluation(s) (bacteriologic cure or failure), it
should also be included. In addition to critical measurements, the tabulation should
note whether the patient was included in the efficacy evaluation (and which
evaluation, if more than one), provide patient compliance information, if collected,
and a reference to the location of the case report form, if included. Critical baseline
information such as age, sex, and weight; disease being treated (if more than one in
study); and disease stage or severity is also helpful. The baseline values for critical
measurements would ordinarily be included as zero time values for each efficacy
measurement.
The tabulation described should usually be included in Appendix 16.2.6 of the
study report, rather than in the more extensive case report tabulations required by
some regulatory authorities, because it represents the basic efficacy data
supporting summary tables. Such a thorough tabulation can be unwieldy for review
purposes, however, and it is expected that more targeted displays will be

24developed as well. For example, if there are many measurements reported,
tabulations of the most critical measurements for each patient (e.g., the blood
pressure value at certain visits might be more important than others) will be useful
in providing an overview of each individual's results in a study, with each patient's
response summarized on a single line or small number of lines.
11.4.4 Drug Dose, Drug Concentration, and Relationships to Response
When the dose in each patient can vary, the actual doses received by patients
should be shown and individual patient's doses should be tabulated. Although
studies not designed as dose-response studies may have limited ability to
contribute dose-response information, the available data should be examined for
whatever information they can yield. In examining the dose response, it may be
helpful to calculate dose as mg/kg body weight or milligram per square meter
(mg/m2) body surface.
Drug concentration information, if available, should also be tabulated (Appendix
16.2.5), analyzed in pharmacokinetic terms, and, if possible, related to response.
Further guidance on the design and analysis of studies exploring dose-response or
concentration response can be found in the ICH Guideline entitled
“Dose-Response Information to Support Drug Registration.”
11.4.5 Drug-Drug and Drug-Disease Interactions
Any apparent relationship between response and concomitant therapy and between
response and past and/or concurrent illness should be described.
11.4.6 By-Patient Displays
While individual patient data ordinarily can be displayed in tabular listings, it has
on occasion been helpful to construct individual patient profiles in other formats,
such as graphic displays. These might, for example, show the value of a particular
parameter(s) over time, the drug dose over the same period, and the times of
particular events (e.g., an adverse event or change in concomitant therapy). Where
group mean data represent the principal analyses, this kind of “case report extract”
may offer little advantage; it may be helpful, however, if overall evaluation of
individual responses is a critical part of the analysis.
11.4.7 Efficacy Conclusions
The important conclusions concerning efficacy should be concisely described,
considering primary and secondary endpoints, prespecified and alternative

25statistical approaches, and results of exploratory analyses.
12. SAFETY EVALUATION
Analysis of safety-related data can be considered at three levels. First, the extent of exposure
(dose, duration, number of patients) should be examined to determine the degree to which safety
can be assessed from the study. Second, the more common adverse events and laboratory test
changes should be identified, classified in some reasonable way, compared for treatment groups,
and analyzed, as appropriate, for factors that may affect the frequency of adverse reactions/events,
such as time dependence, relation to demographic characteristics, relation to dose or drug
concentration. Finally, serious adverse events and other significant adverse events should be
identified, usually by close examination of patients who left the study prematurely because of an
adverse event, whether or not identified as drug related, or who died.
The ICH Guideline entitled “Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for
Expedited Reporting” defines serious adverse events as follows: “A serious adverse event
(experience) or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death, is
life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,
results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.”
For the purpose of this guideline, “other significant adverse events” are marked hematological and
other laboratory abnormalities and any adverse events that led to an intervention, including
withdrawal of drug treatment, dose reduction, or significant additional concomitant therapy.
In the following sections, three kinds of analysis and display are called for:
1. Summarized data, often using tables and graphical presentations presented in the main
body of the report;
2. Listings of individual patient data; and
3. Narrative statements of events of particular interest.
In all tabulations and analyses, events associated with both test drug and control treatment should
be displayed.
12.1 Extent of Exposure
The extent of exposure to test drugs/investigational products (and to active control and
placebo) should be characterized according to the number of patients exposed, the
duration of exposure, and the dose to which they were exposed.
Duration:  Duration of exposure to any dose can be expressed as a median or
mean, but it is also helpful to describe the number of patients exposed for specified
periods of time, such as for 1 day or less, 2 days to 1 week, more than 1 week to 1

26month, more than 1 month to 6 months. The numbers exposed to test
drug(s)/investigational product(s) for the various durations should also be broken
down into age, sex, and racial subgroups, and any other pertinent subgroups, such
as groups defined by disease (if more than one is represented), disease severity, or
concurrent illness.
Dose: The mean or median dose used and the number of patients exposed to
specified daily dose levels should be given; the daily dose levels used could be the
maximum dose for each patient, the dose with longest exposure for each patient,
or the mean daily dose. It is often useful to provide combined dose-duration
information, such as the numbers exposed for a given duration (e.g., at least 1
month) to the most common dose, the highest dose, or the maximum
recommended dose. In some cases, cumulative dose might be pertinent. Dosage
may be given as the actual daily dose or on a mg/kg or mg/m<SUP>2 basis, as
appropriate. The number of patients exposed to various doses should be broken
down into age, sex, racial, and any other pertinent subgroups.
Drug concentration: If available, drug concentration data (e.g., concentration at
the time of an event, maximum plasma concentration, area under curve) may be
helpful in individual patients for correlation with adverse events or changes in
laboratory variables. (Appendix 16.2.5.)
It is assumed that all patients entered into treatment who received at least one dose of the
treatment are included in the safety analysis; if not, an explanation should be provided.
12.2 Adverse Events
12.2.1 Brief Summary of Adverse Events 
The overall adverse event experience in the study should be described in a brief
narrative, supported by the following more detailed tabulations and analyses. In
these tabulations and analyses, events associated with both the test drug and
control treatment should be displayed.
12.2.2 Display of Adverse Events 
All adverse events occurring after initiation of study treatments (including events
likely to be related to the underlying disease or likely to represent concomitant
illness, unless there is a prior agreement with the regulatory authority to consider
specified events as disease related) should be displayed in summary tables (section
14.3.1). The tables should include changes in vital signs and any laboratory
changes that were considered serious adverse events or other significant adverse
events.

27In most cases, it will also be useful to identify in such tables “treatment emergent
signs and symptoms” (TESS: events not seen at baseline and events that worsened
even if present at baseline).
The tables should list each adverse event, the number of patients in each treatment
group in whom the event occurred, and the rate of occurrence. When treatments
are cyclical, e.g., cancer chemotherapy, it may also be helpful to list results
separately for each cycle. Adverse events should be grouped by body system. Each
event may then be divided into defined severity categories (e.g., mild, moderate,
severe) if these were used. The tables may also divide the adverse events into those
considered at least possibly related to drug use and those considered not related,
or use another causality scheme (e.g., unrelated or possibly, probably, or definitely
related). Even when such a causality assessment is used, the tables should include
all adverse events, whether or not considered drug related, including events
thought to represent intercurrent illnesses. Subsequent analyses of the study or of
the overall safety data base may help to distinguish between adverse events that
are, or are not, considered drug related. So that it is possible to analyze and
evaluate the data in these tables, it is important to identify each patient having each
adverse event. An example of such a tabular presentation is shown below.

Patient identification number.2
In addition to these complete tables provided in section 14.3.1, an additional
summary table comparing treatment and control groups, without the patient
identifying numbers and limited to relatively common adverse events (e.g., those in
at least 1 percent of the treated group), should be provided in the body of the
report.
In presenting adverse events, it is important both to display the original terms used
by the investigator and to attempt to group related events (i.e., events that
probably represent the same phenomenon), so that the true occurrence rate is not
obscured. One way to do this is with a standard adverse reaction/events dictionary.
12.2.3 Analysis of Adverse Events
The basic display of adverse event rates described in section 12.2.2 (and located in
section 14.3.1) of the report should be used to compare rates in treatment and
control groups. For this analysis, it may be helpful to combine the event severity
categories and the causality categories, leading to a simpler side-by-side
comparison of treatment groups. In addition, although this is usually best done in
an integrated analysis of safety, if study size and design permit, it may be useful to
examine the more common adverse events that seem to be drug related for
relationship to dosage and mg/kg or mg/m<SUP>2 dose; dose regimen; duration
of treatment; total dose; demographic characteristics such as age, sex, race; other
baseline features such as renal status, efficacy outcomes, and drug concentration. It
may also be useful to examine time of onset and duration of adverse events. A
variety of additional analyses may be suggested by the study results or by the
pharmacology of the test drug/investigational product.
It is not intended that every adverse event be subjected to rigorous statistical
evaluation. It may be apparent from initial display and inspection of the data that a
significant relation to demographic or other baseline features is not present. If the
studies are small and if the number of events is relatively small, it may be sufficient
to limit analyses to a comparison of treatment and control.
Under certain circumstances, life table or similar analyses may be more informative
than reporting of crude adverse event rates. When treatments are cyclical, e.g.,
cancer chemotherapy, it may also be helpful to analyze results separately for each
cycle.
12.2.4 Listing of Adverse Events by Patient
All adverse events for each patient, including the same event on several occasions,

29should be listed in Appendix 16.2.7, giving both preferred term and the original
term used by the investigator. The listing should be by investigator and by
treatment group and should include:
Patient identifier.
Age, race, sex, weight (height, if relevant).
Location of case report forms, if provided.
The adverse event (preferred term, reported term).
Duration of the adverse event.
Severity (e.g., mild, moderate, severe).
Seriousness (serious/nonserious).
Action taken (none, dose reduced, treatment stopped, specific treatment
instituted, and so forth).
    Outcome (e.g., CIOMS format).
Causality assessment (e.g., related/not related). How this was determined
should be described in the table or elsewhere.
Date of onset or date of clinic visit at which the event was discovered.
Timing of onset of the adverse event in relation to the last dose of the test
drug/investigational product (when applicable).
Study treatment at the time of event or the most recent study treatment
taken.
Test drug/investigational product dose in absolute amount, mg/kg or
mg/m<SUP>2, at time of event.
Drug concentration (if known).
Duration of test drug/investigational product treatment.
Concomitant treatment during study.

30Any abbreviations and codes should be clearly explained at the beginning of the
listing or, preferably, on each page.
12.3. Deaths, Other Serious Adverse Events, and Other Significant Adverse Events
Deaths, other serious adverse events, and other significant adverse events deserve special
attention.
12.3.1 Listing of Deaths, Other Serious Adverse Events, and Other Significant
Adverse Events
Listings, containing the same information as called for in section 12.2.4, should be
provided for the following events.
12.3.1.1 Deaths 
All deaths during the study, including the post-treatment followup period,
and deaths that resulted from a process that began during the study, should
be listed by patient in section 14.3.2.
12.3.1.2 Other Serious Adverse Events
All serious adverse events (other than death but including the serious
adverse events temporally associated with or preceding the deaths) should
be listed in section 14.3.2. The listing should include laboratory
abnormalities, abnormal vital signs, and abnormal physical observations
that were considered serious adverse events.
12.3.1.3 Other Significant Adverse Events
Marked hematological and other laboratory abnormalities (other than those
meeting the definition of serious) and any events that led to an intervention,
including withdrawal of test drug/investigational product treatment, dose
reduction, or significant additional concomitant therapy, other than those
reported as serious adverse events, should be listed in section 14.3.2.
12.3.2 Narratives of Deaths, Other Serious Adverse Events, and Certain Other
Significant Adverse Events
There should be a brief narrative describing each death, other serious adverse
event, and other significant adverse event that is judged to be of special interest
because of clinical importance. These narratives can be placed either in the text of
the report or in section 14.3.3, depending on their number. Events that were

31clearly unrelated to the test drug/investigational product may be omitted or
described very briefly. In general, the narrative should describe the following: The
nature and intensity of event; the clinical course leading up to event, with an
indication of timing relevant to test drug/investigational product administration;
relevant laboratory measurements; whether the drug was stopped, and when;
countermeasures; post-mortem findings; investigator's opinion on causality and
sponsor's opinion on causality, if appropriate.
In addition, the following information should be included:
Patient identifier.
Age and sex of patient; general clinical condition of patient, if appropriate.
Disease being treated (this is not required if it is the same for all patients)
with duration (of current episode) of illness.
Relevant concomitant/previous illnesses with details of occurrence/
duration.
Relevant concomitant/previous medication with details of dosage.
Test drug/investigational product administered; drug dose, if this varied
among patients; and length of time administered.
12.3.3 Analysis and Discussion of Deaths, Other Serious Adverse Events, and
Other Significant Adverse Events
The significance of the deaths, other serious adverse events, and other significant
adverse events leading to withdrawal, dose reduction, or institution of concomitant
therapy should be assessed with respect to the safety of the test
drug/investigational product. Particular attention should be paid to whether any of
these events may represent a previously unsuspected important adverse effect of
the test drug/investigational product. For serious adverse events that appear of
particular importance, it maybe useful to use life table or similar analyses to show
their relation to time on test drug/investigational product and to assess their risk
over time.
12.4 Clinical Laboratory Evaluation
12.4.1 Listing of Individual Laboratory Measurements by Patient (Appendix
16.2.8) and Each Abnormal Laboratory Value (see section 14.3.4)

32When required by regulatory authorities, the results of all safety-related laboratory
tests should be available in tabular listings, using a display similar to the following,
where each row represents a patient visit at which a laboratory study was done,
with patients grouped by investigator (if more than one) and treatment group, and
columns include critical demographic data, drug dose data, and the results of the
laboratory tests. Because not all tests can be displayed in a single table, they should
be grouped logically (e.g., hematological tests, liver chemistries, electrolytes,
urinalysis). Abnormal values should be identified, e.g., by underlining or
bracketing. These listings should be submitted as part of the registration/marketing
application, when this is required, or may be available on request.

T21 V14 V17 V20
T32 V15 V18 V21
†Vn = value of particular test
For all regulatory authorities, there should be a by-patient listing of all abnormal
laboratory values in section 14.3.4, using the format described above. For
laboratory abnormalities of special interest (abnormal laboratory values of potential
clinical importance), it may also be useful to provide additional data, such as
normal values before and after the abnormal value, and values of related laboratory
tests. In some cases, it may be desirable to exclude certain abnormal values from
further analysis. For example, single, nonreplicated, small abnormalities of some
tests (e.g., uric acid or electrolytes) or occasional low values of some tests (e.g.,
transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, or BUN) can probably be defined as clinically
insignificant and excluded. Any such decisions should be clearly explained,
however, and the complete list of values provided (or available to authorities on
request) should identify every abnormal value.
12.4.2 Evaluation of Each Laboratory Parameter

33The necessary evaluation of laboratory values will in part be determined by the
results seen, but, in general, the following analyses should be provided. For each
analysis, comparison of the treatment and control groups should be carried out, as
appropriate and compatible with study size. In addition, normal laboratory ranges
should be given for each analysis.
12.4.2.1 Laboratory Values Over Time
For each parameter at each time over the course of the study (e.g., at each
visit) the following should be described: The group mean or median values,
the range of values, and the number of patients with abnormal values or
with abnormal values that are of a certain size (e.g., twice the upper limit of
normal or five times the upper limit; choices should be explained). Graphs
may be used.
12.4.2.2 Individual Patient Changes
An analysis of individual patient changes by treatment group should be
given. A variety of approaches may be used, including:
i) “Shift tables” - These tables show the number of patients
who are low, normal, or high at baseline and at selected time
intervals.
ii) Tables showing the number or fraction of patients who had
a change in parameter of a predetermined size at selected time
intervals. For example, for BUN, it might be decided that a change
of more than 10 mg/dL BUN should be noted. For this parameter,
the number of patients having a smaller or greater change would be
shown for one or more visits, usually grouping patients separately
depending on baseline BUN (normal or elevated). The possible
advantage of this display, compared to the usual shift table, is that
changes of a certain size are noted, even if the final value is not
abnormal.
iii) A graph comparing the initial value and the on-treatment
values of a laboratory measurement for each patient by locating the
point defined by the initial value on the abscissa and a subsequent
value on the ordinate. If no changes occur, the point representing
each patient will be located on the 45 deg. line. A general shift to
higher values will show a clustering of points above the 45 deg.
line. As this display usually shows only a single time point for a
single treatment, interpretation requires a time series of these plots

34for treatment and control groups. Alternatively, the display could
show baseline and most extreme on-treatment value. These displays
identify outliersreadily (it is useful to include patient identifiers for
the outliers).
12.4.2.3. Individual Clinically Significant Abnormalities
Clinically significant changes (defined by the applicant) should be
discussed. A narrative of each patient whose laboratory abnormality was
considered a serious adverse event and, in certain cases, considered an
“other significant adverse event,” should be provided under section 12.3.2
or 14.3.3. When toxicity grading scales are used (e.g., WHO, NCI),
changes graded as severe should be discussed regardless of seriousness. An
analysis of the clinically significant changes, together with a recapitulation
of discontinuations due to laboratory measurements, should be provided
for each parameter. The significance of the changes and likely relation to
the treatment should be assessed, e.g., by analysis of such features as
relationship to dose, relationship to drug concentration, disappearance on
continued therapy, positive dechallenge, positive rechallenge, and the
nature of concomitant therapy.
12.5. Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety
Vital signs, other physical findings, and other observations related to safety should be
analyzed and presented in a way similar to laboratory variables. If there is evidence of a
drug effect, any dose-response or drug-concentration-response relationship or relationship
to patient variables (e.g., disease, demographics, concomitant therapy) should be identified
and the clinical relevance of the observation described. Particular attention should be given
to changes not evaluated as efficacy variables and to those considered to be adverse
events.
12.6 Safety Conclusions
The overall safety evaluation of the test drug(s)/investigational product(s) should be
reviewed, with particular attention to events resulting in changes of dose or need for
concomitant medication, serious adverse events, events resulting in withdrawal, and
deaths. Any patients or patient groups at increased risk should be identified and particular
attention should be paid to potentially vulnerable patients who may be present in small
numbers, e.g., children, pregnant women, frail elderly, people with marked abnormalities
of drug metabolism or excretion. The implication of the safety evaluation for the possible
uses of the drug should be described.
13. DISCUSSION AND OVERALL CONCLUSIONS

35The efficacy and safety results of the study and the relationship of risks and benefits should be
briefly summarized and discussed, referring to the tables, figures, and sections above as needed.
The presentation should not simply repeat the description of results nor introduce new results.
The discussion and conclusions should clearly identify any new or unexpected findings, comment
on their significance, and discuss any potential problems such as inconsistencies between related
measures. The clinical relevance and importance of the results should also be discussed in the light
of other existing data. Any specific benefits or special precautions required for individual subjects
or at-risk groups and any implications for the conduct of future studies should be identified.
Alternatively, such discussions may be reserved for summaries of safety and efficacy referring to
the entire dossier (integrated summaries).
14. TABLES, FIGURES, AND GRAPHS REFERRED TO BUT NOT INCLUDED IN
THE TEXT
Figures should be used to visually summarize the important results, or to clarify results that are
not easily understood from tables.
Important demographic, efficacy, and safety data should be presented in summary figures or tables
in the text of the report. However, if these become obtrusive because of size or number they
should be presented here, cross-referenced to the text, along with supportive, or additional,
figures, tables, or listings.
The following information may be presented in this section of the core clinical study report:
14.1 Demographic Data Summary figures and tables. 
14.2 Efficacy Data Summary figures and tables.
14.3 Safety Data Summary figures and tables.

14.3.2 Listings of Deaths, Other Serious and Significant Adverse Events 
14.3.3 Narratives of Deaths, Other Serious and Certain Other Significant Adverse
Events 
14.3.4 Abnormal Laboratory Value Listing (each patient)
15. REFERENCE LIST
A list of articles from the literature pertinent to the evaluation of the study should be provided.

36Copies of important publications should be attached in an Appendix (Appendices 16.1.11 and
16.1.12). References should be given in accordance with the internationally accepted standards of
the 1979 Vancouver Declaration on “Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to
Biomedical Journals” or the system used in “Chemical Abstracts.”
16. APPENDICES
This section should be prefaced by a full list of all Appendices available for the study report.
Where permitted by the regulatory authority, some of the following Appendices need not be
submitted with the report but need to be provided only on request.
The applicant should therefore clearly indicate those Appendices that are submitted with the

GUIDANCE FOR SECTION 11.4.2 -- STATISTICAL/ANALYTICAL ISSUES
 AND APPENDIX 16.1.9
A. Statistical Considerations
Details of the statistical analysis performed on each primary efficacy variable should be presented
in Appendix 16.1.9. Details reported should include at least the following information:
(a) The statistical model underlying the analysis. This should be presented precisely
and completely, using references if necessary.
(b) A statement of the clinical claim tested in precise statistical terms, e.g., in terms of
null and alternative hypotheses.
(c) The statistical methods applied to estimate effects, construct confidence intervals,
etc. Literature references should be included where appropriate.
(d) The assumptions underlying the statistical methods. It should be shown, insofar as
statistically reasonable, that the data satisfy crucial assumptions, especially when necessary
to confirm the validity of an inference. When extensive statistical analyses have been
performed by the applicant, it is essential to consider the extent to which the analyses were
planned prior to the availability of data and, if they were not, how bias was avoided in
choosing the particular analysis used as a basis for conclusions. This is particularly
important in the case of any subgroup analyses, because if such analyses are not
preplanned they will ordinarily not provide an adequate basis for definitive conclusions.
(i) In the event data transformation was performed, a rationale for the choice
of data transformation along with interpretation of the estimates of treatment
effects based on transformed data should be provided.
(ii) A discussion of the appropriateness of the choice of statistical procedure
and the validity of statistical conclusions will guide the regulatory authority's
statistical reviewer in determining whether reanalysis of data is needed.
(e) The test statistic, the sampling distribution of the test statistic under the null
hypothesis, the value of the test statistic, significance level (i.e., p-value), and intermediate
summary data, in a format that enables the regulatory authority's statistical reviewer to
verify the results of the analysis quickly and easily. The p-values should be designated as
one or two tailed. The rationale for using a one-tailed test should be provided.

VIII-2For example, the documentation of a two-sample t-test should consist of the value of the
t-statistic, the associated degrees of freedom, the p-value, the two sample sizes, mean and
variance for each of the samples, and the pooled estimate of variance. The documentation
of multicenter studies analyzed by analysis of variance techniques should include, at a
minimum, an analysis of variance table with terms for centers, treatments, their interaction,
error, and total. For crossover designs, the documentation should include information
regarding sequences, patients within sequences, baselines at the start of each period,
washouts and length of washouts, dropouts during each period, treatments, periods,
treatment by period interaction, error, and total. For each source of variation, aside from
the total, the table should contain the degrees of freedom, the sum of squares, the mean
square, the appropriate F-test, the p-value, and the expected mean square.
Intermediate summary data should display the demographic data and response data,
averaged or otherwise summarized, for each center-by-treatment combination (or other
design characteristic such as sequence) at each observation time.
B. Format and Specifications for Submission of Data Requested by Regulatory Authority's
Statistical Reviewers
In the report of each controlled clinical study, there should be data listings (tabulations) of patient
data utilized by the sponsor for statistical analyses and tables supporting conclusions and major
findings. These data listings are necessary for the regulatory authority's statistical review, and the
sponsor may be asked to supply these patient data listings in a computer-readable form.
