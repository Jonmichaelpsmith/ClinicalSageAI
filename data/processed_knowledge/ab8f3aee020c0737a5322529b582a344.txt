 1 INTRODUCTION  1 
1.1 Objectives of the Guideline  2 
The following guideline outlines the stability data expectations for drug substances and drug products . 3 
This guideline  is applicable to marketed drug products , including those associated with registration and 4 
lifecycle/post -approval  changes  and, when applicable, master files. These applications are hereafter 5 
collectively referred to  in the guideline as regulatory submissions. ICH Q1 is a consolidated revision 6 
that supersedes ICH Q1A -F and Q5C guidelines and  provides additional guidance on pr inciples relating 7 
to stability.   8 
1.2 Scope of the Guideline  9 
This guideline applies to synthetic  and biological drug substances and drug products, including the 10 
following:  11 
• Chemically synthesised  drug substances including oligonucleotides, polysaccharides and 12 
polypeptides (collectively referred to as ‘synthetic chemical entities’ or ‘synthetics’ in this 13 
guideline), semi -synthetic drug substances and fermentation -derived drug substances . 14 
• Therapeuti c proteins/polypeptides, polysaccharides and proteoglycans produced using 15 
recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology or isolated from  human,  animal or plant tissues, other 16 
natural sources, including body fluids (such as plasma -derived products), or cell cultures . 17 
• Conjugated products that are made up of proteins/polypeptides linked to another moiety ( e.g., 18 
antibody -drug conjugate) . 19 
• Vaccines, allergenic products, and adjuvants . 20 
• Autologous and allogenic cell -based substances, including those which may be genetically 21 
modified ex-vivo (refer to Annex 3 – Stability of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products 22 
(ATMPs)) . 23 
• Gene therapy products that mediate their effect by the expression (transcription or translation) 24 
of transferred genetic materials and genome editing products used to modify cells (refer to 25 
Annex 3 – Stability of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs)) . 26 
• The d rug constituent part of a combination of a drug product with  a medical device (both 27 
integra l or co -packaged ). 28 
• Co-packaged solvents/ diluents . 29 
• Natural health products that are regulated as drug products.  30 

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
7 
 The guideline is applicable to all regulatory submissions  and, in accordance with regional regulations, 31 
can apply to prescription and non -prescription drug products (e.g., regulated over -the-counter products), 32 
original drug products (e.g., new entities),  new product presentations , abbreviated/abridged applications 33 
(e.g., generics) and biosimilars.  34 
The principles outlined in this guideline are applicable to support post -approval changes (PACs) that 35 
require supportive and confirmatory stability studies, inclu ding those that are discussed within ICH 36 
Q12.   37 
Although this guideline is not directly applicable to drug substances and drug products  during clinical 38 
development stages, the concepts can apply proportionate to increasing level of product and process 39 
under standing during pharmaceutical development.  The data from development batches that meet 40 
primary stability requirements may be used to support a regulatory submission  and for product lifecycle 41 
management.  Refer to Section 15 - Stability  Considerations for Commitments and Product Lifecyle 42 
Management . 43 
The guideline is not applicable to device constituent parts, radiopharmaceuticals and whole blood 44 
products.  45 
1.3 Introduction to Guideline and General  Principles  46 
The purpose of stability testing i s to provide evidence on how the quality of a drug substance or drug 47 
product varies with time under the influence of a variety of environmental and physical factors such as 48 
temperature, humidity, light, or agitation.  Stability testing establishes and conf irms a re-test period or 49 
shelf life for the drug substance or a shelf life for the drug product in the proposed container closure 50 
system under  the recommended storage conditions . Shelf  life is also referred to as dating period or 51 
expiry period in some regions. This guideline provides comprehensive guidance to establish stability 52 
for all molecule types within its scope and includes recommendations on how science - and risk -based 53 
principles  may be applied.  A standard approach to assess each stability -related topic is provided by 54 
describing the general principles and strategies to assess stability. In addition, the principles of Quality 55 
by Design described within ICH Q8 -Q11 and Q14 , through enhanced understanding of critical quality 56 
attributes (CQA s) and the impact that the manufacturing process can have on these attributes, are 57 
applicable to the design of an overall stability strategy.  58 
This guideline should be considered in its entirety for  a comprehensive approach to stability studies.  59 
The guideline exemplifies the standard  stability data package for drug substances and drug products 60 
and provides guidance on alternative  and scientifically  justified approaches that encompass the variety 61 
of different situations that may be encountered due to specific scientific considerations and 62 

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
8 
 characteristics of the data being evaluated. Alternative strategies based on science - and risk -based 63 
principles ( e.g., as described in ICH Q8 -Q11 and section IX of ICH Q12 ) for drug substances and drug 64 
products may be proposed by the applicant  of a regulatory submission , leveraging quality risk 65 
management principles , pharmaceutical development data  (e.g., as discusse d in Section 2 – 66 
Development Studies Under Stressed and Forced Conditions) , prior knowledge and modelling , (e.g., as 67 
discussed in Annex 2 -Stability Modelling ).  Examples are provided under specific sections to illustrate 68 
how science - and risk -based strate gies may be applied.   69 
Unless otherwise specified, the recommendations described in this gui deline  apply to both drug 70 
substance and drug products . Additionally:  71 
• Each section may include guidance for specific product types (e.g., synthetics, biologicals, 72 
vaccines or a combination drug product with a medical device ) where relevant.  73 
• For semi -synthetics , fermentation and conjugated products, the recommendation s for synthetic s 74 
and biologi cals would apply , as appropriate .   75 
• Where “products” is mentioned by itself in this guideline, this is to be interpreted as “drug 76 
substances and drug products”.  77 
• Recommendations on the general principles for stability studies and data expectations for drug 78 
substances and drug products apply across all climatic zones for regulatory submissions  and 79 
lifecycle management. The mean kinetic temperature  in any part of the  world can be derived 80 
from climatic data, which divides the world into four climatic zones, I -IV (13, 14). The four 81 
zones are distinguished by their characteristic prevalent annual climatic conditions based  on the 82 
concept originally described by W. Grimm ( 15), updated in W . Grimm ( 16) and adopted under 83 
WHO Technical Report s (13, 14 ). This guideline addresses all four climatic zones. The 84 
principle has been established that if the stability information is generated under a more severe 85 
climatic zone storage condition, it would be acceptable in the other climatic zones, provided 86 
the information is consistent with this guideline and the labelling and storage statements are in 87 
accordance with regional requirements.  88 
• The recommendations may be applicable to drug substance intermediates and drug product 89 
intermediates.  Intermediates that are stored as part of manufacturing process activities (e.g., 90 
unprocessed bulk harvest , granulation s) should be evaluated in accordance with Section 9 - 91 
Stabi lity Consideration s for Processing and Holding Times for Intermediates. For those 92 
intermediates that are packaged and stored outside of manufacturing process activities , a 93 
holding time may be established or it may be appropriate to establish a re-test period  or shelf 94 

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
9 
 life as per the applicable sections of this guideline (e.g., antibody prior to conjugation and a 95 
spray dried dispersion).  96 
• The recommendations may be applicable  to reference materials  as well as  to drug products 97 
containing certain excipients  and adjuvants where the stability of these components can 98 
significantly impact drug product performance. Refer to Section 12- Reference Materials , 99 
Novel Excipients and Adjuvants for detailed guidance. Co -packaged solvents/ diluents should 100 
follow the recomm endations for drug products.  101 
• Regulatory expectations for the stability data package in this guideline are also applicable to 102 
drug substances and drug products made using continuous manufacturing (CM) processes.  103 
• Annexes are intended to either supplement the guideline with specific guidance on enhanced 104 
approaches or to provide product -specific guidance for product types with specific and unique 105 
stability considerations.  Annex 1 provides guidance on Reduced Protocol Design; Annex 2 106 
provides guid ance on Stability Modelling; and Annex 3 provides Additional Considerations for 107 
ATMPs.  108 
The main types of stability studies  are graphically represented in Figure 1.  109 
Figure 1: Stability Study Types  110 
 111 
 112 
Formal s tability studies are primary, commitment, ongoing and product lifecycle stability studies 113 
conducted under the accelerated, intermediate, or long -term storage conditions (as applicable) to 114 
establish or confirm a re -test period or a shelf life.  Supportive stability studies are those stability studies 115 
that are conducted (as applicable) to support the practical use of the product (including label claims) or 116 
a re-test period or a shelf life  (e.g., photostability, in -use, short -term storage condition studies and  117 


ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
10 
 studies to support exc ursions  or modelling). Formal and supportive stability  studies and their purposes 118 
are described in various sections of this guideline .  In addition to formal stability studies, guidance is 119 
provided on studies that inform stability knowledge and product und erstanding  (refer to Section 2  – 120 
Development Studies Under Stressed and Forced Conditions).  The se development studies are 121 
introduced in Section 2 because some  of this information is utili sed to develop the primary stability 122 
protocol and the validation of stability -indicating methodologies.  123 
The guideline discusses strategies for protocol design within Section 3 - Stability Protocol Design  to 124 
Section 7 - Storage Conditions . The recommendations in these sections are applicable to primary 125 
stability studies. However, the principles of protocol design are intended to apply to any stability 126 
protocol (e.g., commitment, ongoing and product lifecycle stability studies , including those to support 127 
changes ). 128 
The concept of a ‘representative batch’ to support establishing the re -test period or shelf life is 129 
referenced throughout this guideline. The justification that a batch is representative will vary depending 130 
on the drug substance and drug product types, th eir complexity and manufacturing process es.  This is 131 
discussed in detail within Section 4 - Selection of Batches.  132 
The applicant should consider all available stability knowledge when designing stability protocols and 133 
defining information for inclusion on t he product labelling (e.g., storage statements). This includes 134 
considerations of the impact of holding times, the primary stability data and supportive stability data to 135 
inform long -term, short -term and in -use storage conditions.  In many cases, stability protocol designs 136 
may be dependent on the potential impact on the final product quality and therefore based on quality 137 
risk management.  138 
This guideline does not specify filing mechanisms or regional requirements.  139 
2 DEVELOPMENT STABILITY  STUDIES UNDER STRESS AND FORCED 140 
CONDITIONS  141 
Product knowledge is useful in the design of formal stability study protocols. Development studies may 142 
be useful to characteri se the physical, chemical and biological changes  likely to occur with storage , to 143 
establish the degradation profile and intrinsic stability of the product, to confirm and validate the 144 
stability -indicating nature of the analytical procedures, to inform  specifications and to determin e 145 
whether unexpected exposures to conditions other than those defined in the label are deleterious to the 146 
product ( refer to Section 14 – Excursions Outside of  a Labelling Claim ).  In addition, these development 147 
studies can  be used to help design the  primary stability protocol and may also be applied to pro tocols 148 
used to support changes during the product lifecycle (refer to Section 3 - Stability Protocol Design and 149 
Section 15 - Stability Considerations for Commitments and Product Lifecyle Management ).   150 

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
11 
 In the context of generating product knowledge, studie s may be performed under accelerated and/or 151 
stress conditions, including forced conditions. The nature of this  testing  shoul d be proportionate to the 152 
knowledge available , the type of the drug substance  or drug product being  evaluated and the quality 153 
attribute(s) being investigated.    154 
Accelerated conditions (temperature and when  applicable, humidity ), over a defined time period, are 155 
intended to increase the rate of chemical degradation, physical change and/or biochemical  change in 156 
the product.  Data generated under accelerated conditions can be used to gain product knowledge and 157 
to support extrapolation, re -test or shelf life  determination and  to evaluate the impact of excursions 158 
outside the label storage conditions. Accelera ted testing is  typically included as part of the formal 159 
stability program as described in Sections 3 – Stability Protocol Design  through Section 7 – Storage 160 
Conditions .   161 
Development studies  undertaken to assess the effect of stress on the drug substance a nd/or drug product 162 
can be divided into two categories:    163 
1) Studies conducted under stress co nditions : Conditions are more severe than the accelerated 164 
conditions but not  necessarily  intended to deliberately degrade the sample.   165 
2) Studies conducted under  force d degradation conditions : Conditions are intended to deliberately 166 
degrade the sample (such as elevated temperature,  humidity, pH, oxidation, agitation  and light).  167 
The purpose of this section is to describe the principles of development studies under stres s and forced 168 
conditions. This section provides clarity on the concepts, study design and considerations for 169 
interpreting the results.  170 
2.1 Development Studies Under Stress Conditions  171 
Studies under stress conditions can contribute to an understanding of product knowledge and the data 172 
gathered from these studies can be useful in addressing unexpected excursion s outside of the conditions 173 
defined on the labelling (refer to Section 14.1 – Excursions Outside of  a Labelling Claim ). 174 
Stress condition studies can include temperature  and humidity  levels above accelerated conditions, 175 
thermal cycling and freeze -thaw studies, as appropriate. For synthetic chemicals entities, these  studies 176 
may be conducted on one batch of the drug product and where relevant one batch of the drug substance 177 
directly exposed or in a container closure system, as applicable. For biologicals, at a minimum, stress  178 
studies may be performed on a single batch of drug product, however, it may be possi ble to justify using 179 
a single batch of drug substance if it is representative of the drug product.  180 

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
12 
 2.2 Development Studies Under Forced Degradation Conditions  181 
Forced degradation studies may be utilised  to investigate potential  degradation  pathways; gain produc t 182 
knowledge; understand the intrinsic stability of product and used to develop and confirm stability - 183 
indicating nature of the analytical procedure (refer to ICH Q2 and ICH Q14) . It is acceptable to leverage 184 
product knowledge  when data is available on ident ified degradation products and pathways , including 185 
scientific  literature.   186 
It is recommended to assess forced conditions on a single batch of the drug substance. It should include 187 
the effect of elevated temperatures, humidity (e.g., 75% Relative Humidity (RH) or greater) where 188 
appropriate, oxidation and photo degradation  on the drug substance. Testing should evaluate  the 189 
susceptibility of the drug substance to hydrolysis across a range of pH values.  Also , a combination  of 190 
forced conditions may be appropriat e to test under certain circumstances (e.g. , agitation and heat).  191 
For drug products, testing under forced conditions is recommended on a single batch of exposed drug 192 
product. It should include the effect of temperature, humidity (e.g. , 75% RH or greater) where 193 
appropriate and light. Additional  forced conditions for specific types of  products and  dosage forms may 194 
be appropriate . 195 
For biologicals, studies under forced degradation conditions  should be performed on a single batch of 196 
drug substance ; alternatively,  it may be possible to justify using a single batch of drug product.   197 
The forced  photodegradation condition can be an  integral part of forced degradation studies. The 198 
purpose of forced photodegradation studies is to evaluate the overall phot osensitivity of the product. A 199 
forced photodegradation  study requires exposure to light conditions which are more extreme than the 200 
light conditions utilised  in confirmatory studies ( refer to Section 8 – Photostability ).  201 
With forced degradation studies, th e conditions and duration may need to be varied depending on the 202 
sensitivity of the product.  For development and analytical procedure  validation purposes, it is 203 
appropriate to limit the exposure and end the forced degradation study if extensive decompositi on 204 
occurs. Similarly, for stable materials, studies may  be terminated after an appropriate exposure level 205 
has been used. The design of these experiments is left to the applicant’s discretion although the exposure 206 
levels used should be justified.  207 
2.3 Analysis and Interpretation of Results  208 
When testing under stressed conditions, including forced degradation, samples should be examined at 209 
the end of the exposure period for any changes in physical, chemical, or biological properties ( e.g., 210 
physical state, clarity,  colour, degradation products, particle size, potency) , as applicable,  by a  211 
procedure suitable to detect any evidence of change.   212 

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
13 
 Changes in attributes that are unlikely to occur under normal storage conditions may occur under forced 213 
conditions and possibly under stress conditions  (e.g., the formation of degradation products) . This 214 
information may be useful in developing and validating suitable analytical procedures and can  be part 215 
of a comprehensive approach to justify the overall control strategy.  216 
The data obtained from these development studies  may also inform product understanding and help 217 
identify the  potential  stability -indicating CQAs that should be monitored during stability testing , 218 
assist ing in the design of the stability protocol ( refer to  Section 3  - Stability Protocol Design ). Although 219 
forced degradation studies are not part of the formal stability studies, results from the forced degradation 220 
studies are an integral part of the information provided to regulatory authorities (e.g. , support  analytical 221 
procedure validation, product characteri sation , specifications or packaging considerations). Data from 222 
development studies under stress  condition should  be included in regulatory submissions if they support  223 
a claim on the product labelling.  224 
3 PROTOCOL DESIGN  FOR FORMAL STABILITY STUDIES  225 
This section provides guidance that is intended to be used in conjunction with Section 4 – Selection of 226 
Batches  through Section 7 – Storage Conditions  to establish a formal stability study protocol.  Figure 2 227 
illustrates how an applicant may approach the design and development of a formal stability protocol. 228 
The “available stability data” in the figure refers to knowledge gained from long -term and accelerated 229 
stability studies conducted earlier in development and from development studies discussed in Section 2 230 
– Development Studies Conducted on Stressed and Forced Conditions .   231 
Where noted, these sections provide specific guidance for establishing a primary stability protocol to  232 
determine  a re-test period or shelf  life (refer to Section 13  - Data Evaluation ). When applicable, the 233 
guidance in these sections should be utilised  in conjunction with Section 15  - Stability Considerations 234 
for Commitments and Product Lifecyle Management  (for commitment stability studies, ongoing 235 
stability studies and lifecycle  stability studies ) and Annex 1  - Reduced Stability Protocol Design  (where 236 
reduced study designs may be appropriate ). 237 
3.1 General Principles  238 
A summary of the stability protocol should be provided in a regulatory submission when a re -test period 239 
or shelf life is to be established or confirmed. The stability protocol incorporates all necessary 240 
information to establish or confirm the stability of the drug substance or drug product under the 241 
recommended storage condit ions throughout the re -test period or shelf life. This includes consideration 242 
of data from  primary stability  studies  and supporti ng data to inform long -term storage, short -term 243 
storage, excursions  and in -use conditions.    244 

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
14 
 An illustration of the general pro cess for the development , design and execution of a stability protocol 245 
is shown in  Figure 2. The applicant is responsible for building knowledge and un derstanding during 246 
pharmaceutical development, leading to the identification of those CQAs that are or have the potential 247 
to be stability -indicating under appropriate storage conditions and using this information to design the 248 
protocol to support the forma l stability studies. Stability studies should include testing of those attributes 249 
that are susceptible to change during storage and can potentially influence quality, safety and efficacy.  250 
During the product’s lifecycle, a s knowledge is gained, stability protocol designs may be optimi sed. 251 
Changes to the stability protocol to extend a re -test period or shelf life should be established in 252 
accordance with Section 15 - Stability Considerations for Commitments and Product Lifecy le 253 
Management .   254

  258 


ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
16 
 The principles detailed for protocol design should be applied from initial regulatory submission  through 259 
product lifecycle.  The precise protocol design will depend on the drug substance/drug product, study 260 
purpose and the available prior knowledge.  261 
Additional protocol considerations for photostability, excursions, short -term storage and in -use 262 
conditions are described in the respective sections (refer to Section 8 – Photostability , Section 14.1 – 263 
Excursions Outside of a Labelling Claim , Section 1 0 - Short -Term Storage  Conditions and Section 1 1 264 
– In-Use Stability ). 265 
A full design stability protocol is a protocol where  at least three batches of the drug substance or at least 266 
three batches of each strength of the drug product covering the proposed container closure systems for 267 
every combination of all design factors are included and tested at all time points.  Alternative approaches 268 
to stability protocol design, such a s bracketing, matrixing, knowledge - and risk -based protocol 269 
reductions and stability models are described in Annex 1 – Reduced Stability Protocol Design and 270 
Annex 2 – Stability Modelling. Additional considerations for ATMPs are provided in Annex 3 – 271 
Stabil ity of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs).  272 
3.2 Stability Data to Support the Initial Re -test Period and Shelf Life  According to the 273 
Standard Approach  274 
This section provides guidance on establishing  the re-test period, shelf life and storage conditions using 275 
data from  the primary stability study  (refer to Section 4 – Selection of Batches ).  This is considered the 276 
standar d approach . When the standard approach  is adopted, the recommendations provided in Table 1 277 
establish an appropriate minimum dataset at the time of the initial regulatory submission to assign a re - 278 
test period and shelf life in accordance  with the guidance provided in Section 13 – Data Evaluation . 279 
Alternative approaches to the principles and practices described in this section may be acceptable if 280 
they are supported by adequate justification, including an enhanced knowledge of product perf ormance  281 
from  prior knowledge, as per ICH Q8  - Q11 and modelling as discussed in Annex 2 - Stability 282 
Modelling .  283 
The stability package provided  in the regulatory submission  should be sufficient to support the proposed 284 
re-test period or shelf life and storage conditions. The long -term stability protocol  should, at a minimum, 285 
ensure testing continue s for the duration of the  proposed re -test period or shelf life.  286 
Data from the  accelerated storage condition s and, if appropriate, from the intermediate storage 287 
condition s can be used to evaluate the effect of short -term excursions outside the label led storage 288 
conditions ( e.g., during shipping). For synthetics, data from the acceler ated storage condition are also 289 
needed to enable extrapolation in accordance with Section 13. 2.5 – Extrapolation for Synthetic 290 
Chemical Entities .  For biologicals, data from the accelerated storage condition is utilised for product 291 

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
17 
 understanding and may be  used to support analytical comparability. Even though data generated under 292 
accelerated storage conditions are not used to establish a re-test period  or shelf life for biologicals , it is 293 
strongly suggested t o include th ese data in the regulatory submission.  294 
Refer to Section 4 – Selection of Batches,  Table 2 for guidance on selection of primary batches.  For 295 
synthetics a nd for biologicals, a primary batch may be a production batch but does not need to be a 296 
production batch.  297 
Biologic al drug substances and drug products usually require stringent conditions for their storage to 298 
ensure maintenance of biological activity and to avoid degradation, because of dependence of molecular 299 
conformation and biological activity on noncovalent as well as covalent forces , resulting their high 300 
sensitivity to environmental factors (e.g., temperature changes, oxidation, light, ionic content a nd 301 
shear).  The evaluation of their stability may necessitate complex analytical methodologies including 302 
physicochemical, biochemical and immunochemical methods, and consideration of many external 303 
conditions which can affect the product’s potency, purity an d quality. For biological drug substances 304 
and drug products, data from three primary batches that cover the duration of the proposed shelf life 305 
should be submitted  unless an alternative approach is justified . When these primary batches are not 306 
production s cale, a minimum of 6 months of data from production  batches should also be submitted to 307 
support the evaluation of the regulatory submission. A minimum of 6 months stability data from primary 308 
batches should be submitted in cases where shelf life is greater than 6 months.  For drug substances and 309 
drug products with a shelf life of less than 6 months, the minimum amount of stability data in the initial 310 
regulatory submission should be determined on a case -by-case basis. Refer to Section 15 - Stability 311 
Considera tions for Commitments and Product Lifecyle Management  for guidance on providing 312 
commitment stability data after marketing authorisation . 313 
A stability study to establish a re-test period  or shelf life should include at least  three batches of the 314 
drug substance or at least  three batches of  each strength of the drug product  covering the proposed 315 
container closure systems.  Reduced designs may be applied where justified (refer to Annex 1  – Reduced 316 
Stability Protocol Design ).  317 
 318 
For synthetic chemical entit ies and biologicals, if primary batches are not production scale or not all at 319 
production scale, the applicant should commit to continuing or initiating and completing a commitment 320 
stability study to establish  and confirm  the re -test period  or shelf life i n accordance with  Section 15 .1 - 321 
Commitment Stability Studies.   322

1 For testing frequency guidance refer to Section 6 – Testing Frequency  
2 For a full design, at least 3 batches of the drug sub stance or at least 3 batches of each strength of the drug product 
covering the proposed container closure systems  are tested . Reduced designs may be applied where justifie d (refer 
to Annex 1  – Reduced Stability Protocol Design ). 
3 If a significant change (refer to Section 13  - Data Evaluation) or an out of specification result occurs at accelerated 
conditions within the first 3 months, it is considered unnecessary to continue to test through 6 months.  
4 In principle, s tability protocols for new dosage forms and new  strengths/concentrations should follow the guidance 
for a new drug. However, a reduced stability dataset at submission time (e.g., 6 months a ccelerated and 6 months 
long term data) may be acceptable in certain justified cases  (refer to Section 15.3 - Stability Studies to Support 
New Dosage Forms and New Strengths/Concentrations ). 
5 There should be a commitment to continue stability studies for production batches corresponding to the proposed 
re-test period  or shelf  life. 
6 A primary batch can be a production batch but does not need to be a production batch.  If the re -test period or shelf 
life proposed from non -production primary bat ch data  is greater than 6 months, stability data from production 
batches should be a minimum of 6 months.  The shelf life would generally be supported by three primary batches 
having stability data through to shelf life . 
7 Testing under accelerated storage  conditions is  strongly  suggested  when appropriate for the storage condition and 
product type and the minimum time period should be justified by the applicant in accordance with the selected 
storage conditions.   A minimum of three time points, including th e initial and final, is recommended.   
 325 

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
19 
 For drug substances and drug products with intended storage periods of less than the recommendations 326 
in Table 1, the minimum amount of stability data in the initial regulatory submission should be 327 
determined based on the product -specific risks and in accordance with Section 6 – Testing Frequency.   328 
3.3 Stability -Indicating Critical Quality Attributes  329 
CQAs should be identified using the principles outlined in ICH Q6 A, Q6B  and ICH Q8 -Q11. When 330 
designing a stability protocol in support of a drug substance or drug product, information on the CQAs 331 
and their tar get acceptance criteria should already be available. Based on prior knowledge and 332 
development data, the applicant should identify the stability -indicating CQAs, which are those attributes 333 
that may change upon storage and may impact the functionality and/or  quality of the drug substance or 334 
drug product.  335 
3.3.1 Recommendations for Establishing a Re-Test Period or Shelf life. 336 
The stability protocol to establish a re -test period or shelf life should include stability -indicating CQAs 337 
and compile a suitable dataset to demonstrate product quality through storage  and use.  For synthetic 338 
chemical drug substances and drug products, the stability protocol should consider appropriate, physical 339 
and chemical attributes. For biological  drug substances and drug products , the protocol should assess  340 
changes in CQAs that affect physicochemical properties, purity and impurity levels, immunochemical 341 
properties and the biological activity of the product, as appropriate. For both synthetics and biological s, 342 
microbiological attr ibutes and product performance characteristics should be confirmed on stability as 343 
applicable. For products that are particularly sensitive to changes in temperature, oxidation, light, 344 
moisture content and shear forces, quality attributes that may be impac ted should be assessed. For 345 
additional information on attributes to be included in the drug substance or drug product specification, 346 
refer to ICH Q6 A and Q6B . 347 
Where excipient levels or their properties may change on stability, potentially impacting drug pr oduct 348 
CQAs, they should be evaluated as part of drug product stability testing, (e.g., levels of surfactant, 349 
preservative  content). In cases where stabili sers are needed for a biological  drug substance, the same 350 
considerations should be applied. Co-package d diluents should follow the recommendations for drug 351 
products.  A risk -based approach is recommended, where development data and excipient prior 352 
knowledge can be used to understand whether additional drug substance and/or drug product stability 353 
data are ap propriate to support the re -test period or shelf life . 354 
In accordance with the principles outlined in ICH Q3D and Q3E, stability -indicating CQA s 355 
considerations should include potential interaction with the respective storage container, contact with 356 
administration or delivery devices (e.g., syringe walls, catheters and injection needle) and dispersion 357 
media (such as solvent s for reconstitution or dilution ).  358 

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
20 
 3.3.2 Recommendation for Lifecycle Stability Protocols  359 
After additional knowledge is gained following establishment of the re -test period or shelf life, data 360 
may confirm that some CQAs do not change on stability and stability protocols to support the product 361 
lifecycle may be updated accordingly (refer to Section 15 – Stability Considerations for Commitments 362 
and Product Lifecyle  and Annex 1  - Reduced Stability Protocol Design ) 363 
3.4 Specification s 364 
3.4.1 Tests and Analytical Procedures  365 
Before a formal stability study protocol is initiated, the suitability of the proposed analytical procedures  366 
to detect changes in the stability -indicating CQAs should be assessed in accordance with ICH Q2  and 367 
ICH Q14. The analytical procedures used to monitor changes in the stability -indicating CQAs should 368 
be chosen and validated to provide assurance that changes to product quality will be detected, measured 369 
and understood over the expected re -test period o r shelf life. Establishment of potential degradation 370 
pathways ( refer to Section 2 .3 -Analysis and Interpretation of Results ) is important when developing 371 
and validating suitable analytical procedures. When feasible f or synthetic chemical entities, the mass  372 
balance relationship between tested attributes should be observed when selecting appropriate stability - 373 
indicating tests. For example, for solid drug substances or drug products, an apparent decrease in the 374 
active moiety could be caused by an increase in d egradation products and/or an increase in moisture 375 
content.  376 
When justified, the analytical procedures used for stability testing may differ from the release analytical 377 
procedure for the same quality attribute (e.g., container closure integrity testing may be used instead of 378 
sterility testing during stability).   In situations where stability -indicating quality attributes are not tested 379 
as part of release testing (e.g., the relevant CQAs are measured and controlled during processing as 380 
described i n ICH Q8), additional analytical procedures should be established to support stability studies.  381 
3.4.2 Acceptance Criteria  382 
The shelf life  acceptance criteria should consider all available stability information from development 383 
and manufacture of the drug substanc e through final drug product shelf life in accordance with ICH 384 
Q6A and Q6B.  As per these guidelines, when a stability -indicating CQA changes over time, it may be 385 
appropriate to establish a release specification that is more stringent than the shelf life  specification to 386 
ensure that the drug substance and/or drug product quality is maintained through to the end of shelf life. 387 
In general, any differences between the release and shelf life  acceptance criteria should be justified with 388 
data.  In case a re -test p eriod is assigned to a drug substance, generally  the acceptance criteria are the 389 
same as at release . 390 

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
21 
 3.4.3 Pharmacopoeial Critical Quality Attributes and Analytical Procedures  391 
When drug substance and/or drug product monographs or general procedures are availabl e and relevant 392 
to the region(s) where the regulatory submission  is to be filed, the monographed CQAs and analytical 393 
procedures are an appropriate starting point in designing a product -specific stability protocol.  Any 394 
differences in the proposed analytical procedures from those in the pharmacopeia should be 395 
scientifical ly justified (e.g., including demonstration of equivalency). A knowledge - and risk -based 396 
approach should then be applied to ensure that any differences in stability behaviour  are properly 397 
controlled.  398 
3.5 Additional Considerations for Vaccines  399 
In cases where th e potency of the product is dependent on conjugation and/or adsorption of the active 400 
ingredient to another moiety (e.g. , carrier), applicants should evaluate potential dissociation of the active 401 
ingredient(s) from the carrier during storage (e.g., in conju gate vaccines).  402 
In cases where the potency of the product is dependent on the inclusion of an adjuvant, the CQAs for 403 
the adjuvant should be evaluated during stability studies . 404 
It is strongly recommended that stability studies for vaccines include mechanism s to evaluate the 405 
potency (i.e., the specific ability or capacity to achieve its intended effect using suitable methods) of 406 
the product.   407 
3.6 Additional Considerations for the Combination  of a Drug  Product with a Medical Device  408 
The stability of a combination  of a drug product with a medical device  considers (a) drug product CQAs 409 
and (b) drug device combination performance characteristics through storage to the completion of 410 
administration (refer to Section 1 1 – In Use Stability).  The functional pe rformance characteristics  of 411 
the device constituent  alone  are outside of the scope of this guideline and are addressed through device 412 
design verification studies.  413 
The stability protocol design for a combination  of a drug product  with a medical device  (integral or co - 414 
packaged) should follow the same principles as described for a drug product, including a risk assessment 415 
and compatibility with contact materials. Stability -indicating attributes of the drug constituent may 416 
impact the medical device functional performance characteristics, and stability studies and conclusions 417 
should account for these interactions. Considerations should be made for the administration -dependent 418 
functional performance characteristics of the fully assembled combination of a drug product with a 419 
medical device  that may be impacted by long -term storage (i.e., CQAs that can only be assessed after 420 
assembly).  The storage orientation may be established based on a risk assessment.  The shelf life of a 421 
co-packaged combination  of a drug product with a medical device should be based on the shorter of 422 

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
22 
 either the device constituent part or the drug constituent part shelf life.  For integrated device -drug 423 
products, the shelf life should be  based on the shorter of either of the constituent part or the final 424 
combination of a drug product with a medical device.  425 
Each type of combination  of a drug product  with a medical device  should  have its own unique list of 426 
quality attributes and administrat ion-dependent functional performance characteristics . Attributes  427 
should be risk assessed according to the specific design of that  product to identify the critical attributes 428 
or characteristics.  The risk assessment may include data from device design devel opment studies and 429 
prior knowledge from similar combination s of a drug  product with a  medical device.  The stability 430 
protocol should use the assembled (integral or co -packaged)  product  representative of the product 431 
proposed for  marketing. If the stability studies were not performed with the combination  of a drug 432 
product with a medical device as  proposed for marketing, the changes made should be assessed and 433 
justified with respect to the impact on stability.  434 
3.7 Risk Management  435 
A scie nce- and risk -based approach should be used to inform the different aspects of protocol design 436 
outlined in Section 4 - Selection of Batches through Section 7 - Storage Conditions.  437 
The inclusion of risk management information with a registered stability protocol is not mandatory, but 438 
in cases where it forms the basis of a justification for enhanced/reduced protocol approaches, 439 
information on the risk assessment process, outcome and the  connection to the stability protocol should 440 
be described.  441 
4 SELECTION OF BATCHES  442 
To establish a re -test period or shelf life for the drug substance and drug product, stability data should 443 
generally be provided on three primary batches.   Alternative approaches for batch requirements may be 444 
supported when justified. Th e manufacturing process for the primary batches of drug substance and 445 
drug product should be similar or representative, but not necessarily identical to the manufacturing 446 
process used for production batches. Hence, a primary batch may be but is not necessa rily a production 447 
batch. Differences in the manufacturing processes for the primary batches and those proposed for 448 
production batches should be justified. Specific considerations for primary stability batches are 449 
provided in Table 2. 450 
For studies that are not a primary study ( e.g., in -use stability, photostability, supportive studies and 451 
stability studies to support post -approval changes ) and use non -production batches, the batches should 452 
be representative as described below : 453 

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
23 
 • Synthetic chemical entities: Chemically synthesised drug substances should be manufactured 454 
by the same synthetic route. Changes to manufacturing process parameters should be 455 
scientif ically justified. Drug products should be of the same formulation and method of 456 
manufacture.   457 
• Biological s:  The quality of all drug substance and drug product batches placed in a stability 458 
program should be manufactured using a similar process to the proposed production 459 
manufacturing process and be analytically  comparable to the production batches ( refer to  ICH 460 
Q5E).  The analytical comparability for the clinical batches and the non -production batches to 461 
the production batches should be demonstrated . A comprehensive analytical comparability 462 
exercise may include additional characterisation testing.  463 
4.1 Considerations for Selection of Primary Stability Batches  464 
Where possible, batches of drug product included in stability testing should be derived from different 465 
batches of drug substance to account for variability in drug substance batches. Stability studies should 466 
be performed on each individual strength, fill v olume and container closure system of the drug product 467 
unless a reduced protocol design is applied (refer to Annex 1 – Reduced Stability Protocol Design).  468 
The primary stability batches of the drug substance and drug product should be representative of the 469 
clinical and production batches as described above . Additional development batches that are 470 
representative of the primary and production batches may also be included as supporting stability data . 471 
Refer to Table 2 below for additional considerations at time of selection of primary stability batches.  472

2In accordance with ICH Q13, the definition of a pilot batch for synthetics does not apply for continuous 
manufacturing.   
When the long -term stability data do not cover the proposed re -test period or shelf life at the time the 474 
marketing application is submitted, refer to Section 15 - Stability Considerations for Commitments and 475 
Product Lifecycle Management for relevant commitments.  476 
4.2 Considerations for Multiple Production Sites  in the Initial Regulatory Submission   477 
The stability data from each site, provided in the initial regulatory submission should be proportionate 478 
to the overall product, process and facility r isk and in accordance with regional requirements.   For both 479 
synthetics and biologicals, when the product, process and production  site are comparable, the re -test 480 
period and/or shelf life would not need to be re -established at an additional  production  site.  An 481 
additional production site refers to any production  site proposed in the initial regulatory submission 482 
other than the drug substance and drug product site where the original production scale batches are 483 
manufactured.  484 
For synthetic chemical entities, a comparison of batch data of the primary batches with data from each 485 
production  site should be provided in the regulatory submission. The amount of stability data provided 486 
for each production  site depends on the risk associated with implementing each addi tional production  487 
site for the drug substance or drug product. A commitment stability study should be established for each 488 
production  site in accordance with Section 15.1 - Commitment Stability Studies .  The number of 489 
production batches from each site in the commitment stability study can be fewer than three with a 490 
supporting scientific justification and risk assessment .  491 

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
25 
 For biologicals, the default minimum stability data presented for each  production  site, should be as 492 
outlined in Table 1 of Section 3.2  -Recommended Minimum Core Stability Data for the Standard 493 
Approach at Submission to Support Initial Re -test Period or Shelf Life.   However, for biologicals with 494 
an enhanced level of product and process understanding , an alternative science - and risk -based approach 495 
may be justified for those additional sites that are receiving the transferred manu facturing process from 496 
an origina ting production  site. A comparability assessment inclusive of accelerated and/or stressed 497 
condition stability results for commercial scale production batches manufactured at the proposed 498 
additional site relative to primary batches from the original production site  should be provided (refer to 499 
ICH Q5E). Based on risk assessment that considers analytical comparability,  process comparability and  500 
production  site history for the manufacture of similar product types, sites receivi ng the transferred 501 
manufacturing process may initially propose a reduced number of production scale stability studies in 502 
the regulatory submission. When a reduced data set is justified, a commitment should be made to 503 
continue stability studies at each site  through the proposed re -test period or shelf life for a total of three 504 
production scale batches in accordance with Section 15.1 - Commitment Stability Studies .    505 
4.3 Considerations for Vaccines   506 
In general, production scale batches are expected to be used to set shelf life of vaccines.  If non - 507 
production scale batches are used as primary batches, a justification should be based on product 508 
knowledge, comparability studies and risk.  The remaining r ecommendations for primary batches for 509 
biological s in Table 2 are also applicable to vaccines .  510 
4.4 Consideration s for Continuous Manufacturing Processes  511 
For guidance on selection of batches from a CM process, refer to ICH Q13 guideline.   For recombinant 512 
protein biological s, the use of a single start -up/shutdown sequence (refer to ICH Q13) to manufacture 513 
multiple primary drug substance stability batches is t ypically not applicable. Primary drug substance 514 
stability batches should be obtained from multiple harvests/cell bank thaws and should cover the entire 515 
cell culture duration. The drug product primary stability batches manufactured by CM processes should 516 
incorporate the variability described for different drug substance batches.  517 
5 CONTAINER CLOSURE SYSTEM  518 
A container closure system comprises the primary (in contact with the product) and the secondary 519 
packaging if the latter are functional (e.g., combination  of a drug product with a medical device ) or 520 
intended to provide additional protection to the drug product.  The stability study design should consider 521 
and include the secondary package when it is protective or directly impacts  the chemical, physical, or 522 
functional attributes, unless otherwise justified.  523 

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
26 
 The primary stability studies for the drug substance should be conducted in a container closure system 524 
that is the same or representative of the packaging proposed for storage a nd distribution. The container 525 
closure system should be  the same type and constructed of the same material as production batches 526 
(dimensions may be smaller). For the drug product, the commercial container closure is recommended 527 
to ensure that the proposed container closure system can adequately protect the dosage form, is 528 
compatible with the dosage form and will function in the manner for which it is designed through a 529 
product's intended shelf life . When applicable, impact of packaging components from which  matter 530 
may migrate into the product (e.g., ink or adhesive from labels) should also be considered.  531 
Changes in the quality of a product may occur due to the interactions between the drug substance or 532 
drug product and the respective container closure system , and the effect of such interactions on product 533 
stability should be evaluated. Any impact of container orientation on the critical quality attributes of the 534 
drug product should be assessed based on prior knowledge gained through development and/or as part  535 
of stability studies. For primary batches of liquids, solutions, semi -solids and suspensions, the product 536 
should be placed into an inverted (or horizontal) position and an upright (or vertical) position unless a 537 
worst -case orientation is justified with su pporting data. However, when drug product -container closure 538 
interactions cannot be excluded, stability studies should include samples maintained in both the inverted 539 
(or horizontal) position, as well as in the upright (or vertical) position (e.g., when sto rage orientation 540 
can have a significant effect on the delivered dose/repriming period of pressurised metered dose 541 
inhalers).  542 
6 TESTING FREQUENCY  543 
The proposed protocol should align with the principles outlined in Section 13 - Data Evaluation and 544 
include suffi cient timepoints to verify any proposed extrapolation or stability model, where appropriate 545 
for the product type.   546 
For primary stability studies, the frequency of testing should be sufficient to establish the stability 547 
profile of the drug substance or drug product. For a drug substance or drug product with a proposed re - 548 
test period/shelf life of 12 months or less, the frequency of testing at the long -term storage condition is 549 
recommended monthly for the first 3 months and at 3 -month intervals thereafter. For cases when an 550 
intended re -test period/shelf life is very short, sufficient time points should be considered. For a drug 551 
substance or drug product with a proposed re -test period/shelf life greater than 12 months, the 552 
recommended frequency of testing at the long -term storage condition should normally be every 3 553 
months over the first year, every 6 months over the second  year and annually thereafter through to the 554 
end of the proposed re -test period/shelf life.  Sterility testing or alternatives (e.g., container  closure 555 

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
27 
 integrity testing) should be performed at a minimum  annually , inclu ding initially and  at the end of the 556 
proposed re-test period or shelf  life. 557 
For studies under accelerated conditions, a minimum of three time points, including the initial and final 558 
time points , is recommended (e.g., 0, 3 and 6 months is recommended for a 6 -month study). Where an 559 
expectation ( e.g., based on development experience) exists that results from accelerated studies are 560 
likely to approach significant change criteria ( refer to Section 13 – Data Evaluation)  or likely to be out 561 
of specification , increased testing is recommended. Increased testing could be conducted either by (a) 562 
including an additional less s evere  temperature condition (i.e., intermediate) that  may be better 563 
predictive of the long -term stability and /or (b) including an additional time point in the ac celerated 564 
study design which may be earlier than the final time point.  Note that this would not preclude following 565 
the re commendations  in Section 13 - Data Evaluation , when deciding whether extrapolation is 566 
applicable. At the intermediate storage condition , a minimum of four time points, including the initial 567 
and final time points (e.g., 0, 6, 9 and 12 months, from a 12 -month study) is recommended.  568 
As discussed in Annex 1  - Reduced Stability  Protocol Design and Section 15. 3 - Product Lifecycle 569 
Stability Studies , a reduced testing frequency may be justified when potential stability -indicating CQAs 570 
show no change over time. The minimum  testing  frequency  recommended in this section  may not be 571 
applicable if alternative strategi es are applied ( refer to  Section 13  – Data Evaluation  and Annex 2  – 572 
Stability Modelling ). 573 
7 STORAGE CONDITIONS  574 
7.1 General Considerations  575 
Stability of drug substances and drug products should be evaluated under storage conditions with 576 
appropriate tolerance s that test for thermal and moisture stability and, if applicable, sensitivity to 577 
potential solvent loss. For sensitivity to light, refer to Section 8 – Photostability . The storage conditions 578 
and the duration of studies chosen should cover the int ended storage and use, including considerations 579 
for shipment  and any short -term storage condition ( refer to Section 1 0 – Short -Term Storage 580 
Conditions) . Advice on storage conditions to support an  in-use period is detailed in Section 1 1 - In-Use 581 
Stability.  582 
Testing at accelerated conditions or stress testing is essential to establish product stability information, 583 
such as to  establish the degradation pathways  and the intrinsic stability of the molecule, to confirm the 584 
stability -indicating nature of the analytical procedures (refer to Section 2 – Development Studies Under 585 
Stress and Forced Conditions and Section 3.3 – Stability -Indicating Critical Quality Attributes ) and 586 
unintended excursions in storage conditions. Data generated under accelerated conditions may enable 587 

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
28 
 stability modelling. Accelerated conditions data may support extrapolation of the intended re -test period 588 
and shelf life  (refer to Section 13  – Data Evaluation).  589 
Since most biologicals are sensitive to physical condi tions, data obtained under accelerated conditions 590 
may confirm the stability -indicating nature of the analytical procedures or help elucidate the degradation 591 
profile of a biological drug substance or drug product.  Data from accelerated conditions could als o 592 
support that  a manufacturing change did not impact the stability profile.  593 
Where it can be justified that a proposed container closure system and conditions of storage afford 594 
sufficient protection against high and low humidity conditions, stability studie s at different relative 595 
humidities can usually be omitted. Appropriate stability data under recommended storage conditions 596 
should be provided if containers other than impermeable containers are used.  597 
The storage conditions to be applied to the different st ability studies are detailed in the sections below. 598 
The equipment  utilised  should be capable of controlling the storage condition within the ranges defined 599 
in this guideline. The actual temperature and humidity (when controlled) should be monitored during 600 
stability storage. Short -term spikes due to opening of doors of the storage facility are accepted as 601 
unavoidable. The effect of excursions due to equipment failure should be addressed and reported if 602 
judged to affect stability results. Excursions that exce ed the defined tolerances for more than 24 hours 603 
should be described in the study report and their effect assessed.  604 
Alternative storage conditions can be used if justified.  Recommendations are applicable to both 605 
synthetic chemical entities and biological products, unless otherwise specified.  606

 7.2 Considerations for Products Intended to be Stored at Room Temperature  608

1Specific regional requirements for more s evere storage conditions may however apply  
2Refer to Section 1.3  – Introduction to Guideline and General Principles  
 
The applicant should determine  and justify the long -term stability studies conditions to be performed.  612 
In general, it is acceptable for stability information to be generated under a more s evere  climatic zone 613 
storage condition already defined in Table 3 to support the labe lling. Testing  at a more s evere  long-term 614 
condition  (e.g., 30°C ± 2°C/75% RH ± 5% RH ) could be justified as it encompasses all climate zones 615 
that a drug substance or drug product may be exposed to. However, if it is demonstrated that the drug 616 
substance or drug product will not remain within its acceptance criteria when stored at the more severe 617 
condition (e.g., 30°C ± 2°C/75% RH ± 5% RH) for the duration of the proposed re -test period or shelf 618 
life, the following are some approaches to consider:  619 
• alternative long -term storage condition for the intended climatic zone . 620 
• a minimal reduction in r e-test period or shelf life .  621 
• evaluation of stability in an alternative container closure system .   622 
• evaluation of formulation and manufacturing process options .  623 

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
30 
  624 
When long -term studies are conducted at 25°C ± 2°C/60% RH ± 5% RH and a significant change oc curs 625 
at any time during 6 months’ testing under accelerated conditions, additional testing at the intermediate 626 
storage condition should be conducted and evaluated against significant change criteria ( refer to Section 627 
13 – Data Evaluation).    628 
If 30°C ± 2°C/ 65% RH ± 5% RH or 30°C ± 2°C/75% RH ± 5% RH is the long -term condition, there is 629 
no intermediate condition defined.  630 
For Climatic Zone III stability studies, an alternative approach to studying at the reference relative 631 
humidity (e.g., 35% RH ± 5% RH) can be achieved by performing the stability studies under higher 632 
relative humidity (e.g., 65% RH ± 5% or 75% RH ± 5%) through mathematical calculation. This can 633 
be achieved by experimentally determining the permeation coefficient for the container closure syst em 634 
(e.g., refer to Example 1 in Section 7.2.2 – Storage Conditions for Products Packaged in Semi - 635 
Permeable Containers).  636 
7.2.1 Storage Conditions for Products Packaged in Impermeable Containers  637 
Since drug substance and drug products packaged in impermeable cont ainers (e.g., aluminium / 638 
aluminium foil blister, sealed glass container ) provide a permanent barrier to passage of moisture or 639 
solvent, sensitivity to moisture or potential for solvent loss is not a concern. Thus, stability studies for 640 
products stored in impermeable containers can be conducted under any humidity condition.     641 
7.2.2 Storage Conditions for Products Packaged in Semi -Permeable Containers   642 
Sensitivity to moisture or potential for solvent loss is a concern for drug substance and drug products 643 
packaged in semi permeable containers. Semi -permeable containers can allow the passage of moisture, 644 
solvent, or gases while preventing solute loss. The mechanism for solvent transport occurs by absorption 645 
into one container surface, diffusion through the b ulk of the container material and desorption from the 646 
other surface. Transport across the container wall is driven by a partial pressure gradient.   647 
Aqueous -based products packaged in semi -permeable containers should be evaluated for potential 648 
water loss in  addition to physical, chemical, biological and microbiological stability. This evaluation 649 
should be carried out under conditions of low relative humidity, as discussed below. Ultimately, it 650 
should be demonstrated that aqueous -based products stored in semi -permeable containers can withstand 651 
low relative humidity environments.  652 
For non -aqueous, solvent -based products, comparable approaches can be developed and applied.    653 

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS

 655 
Testing at a more severe long-term condition, e.g., 30°C ± 2°C/35% RH ± 5% RH  could be justified.  656 
A 5% loss in water from its initial value is considered a significant change for a product packaged in a 657 
semi -permeable container after an equivalent of 3 mon ths’ storage at 40°C ± 2°C /NMT 25% RH. 658 
However, for small containers (1 mL or less) or unit -dose products, a water loss of 5% or more after an 659 
equivalent of 3 months’ storage at 40°C ± 2°C /NMT 25% RH may be acceptable, if justified.  660 
A significant change in water loss alone under the accelerated condition does not necessitate testing at 661 
the intermediate storage condition. However, data should be provided to demonstrate that no significant 662 
water loss has been observed throughout the proposed re -test period / shelf life if stored at 25°C ± 2°C 663 
/ 40% RH ± 5% RH.  664 
When long -term studies are conducted at 25°C ± 2°C/40% RH ± 5% RH, additional testing at the 665 
intermediate storage condition should be performed to evaluate the temperature effect at 30°C if 666 
significant change other than water loss occurs during the 6 month s testing at the accelerated condition.  667 
If 30°C ± 2°C/35% RH ± 5% RH is the long -term condition, there is no intermediate condition.  668 
An alternative approach to performing studies at the reference relative humidity as recommended in 669 
Table 5 is performing the stability studies under higher relative humidity and deriving the water loss at 670 
the reference relative humidity through calculation. This can be achieved by experi mentally determining 671 
the permeation coefficient for the container closure system (e.g., as shown in the illustrative example 672 
below, using the calculated ratio of water loss rates for the container closure system between the two 673 
relative humidity conditions  at the same temperature). The permeation coefficient for a container 674 
closure system can be experimentally determined by using the worst -case scenario (e.g., the most 675 
diluted of a series of concentrations) for the proposed drug product.  676 
Example 1. An appro ach for determining water loss:  677 
For a product in a given container closure system, container size  and fill, an appropriate approach for 678 
deriving the water loss rate at the reference relative humidity is to multiply the water loss rate measured 679 
at an altern ative relative humidity at the same temperature by a water loss rate ratio determined 680 

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
32 
 experimentally shown in Table 5 below.  A linear water loss rate at the alternative relative humidity over 681 
the storage period should be demonstrated.  682 
For the below illustrative example, at a given temperature (e.g., 40°C) the water loss rate determined 683 
experimentally for the proposed container closure system during storage at NMT 25% RH is the water 684 
loss rate measured at 75% RH multiplied by 3.0, the corresponding water loss rate ratio.  685

 687 
The ratios described in Table 5 above are for illustrative purposes. Actual ratios for water loss rates 688 
determined experimentally for the proposed container closure sy stem under various relative humidity 689 
conditions should be provided.  690 
7.3 Considerations for Refrigerated Temperature Storage  691 
Recommendations for drug substance and drug products intended for long -term storage under 692 
refrigerated conditions are provided below. A ccelerated conditions are intended to  demonstrate the 693 
effect of temperature , and active humidity control may not be needed when justified.  694 
Table 6: Storage Under Refrigerated Conditions  695 
Long -term  Accelerated  
5°C ± 3°C   25°C ± 2°C or any alternative temperature condition when justified.  
 696 
For an aqueous -based product packaged in a semi -permeable container, appropriate information should 697 
be provided to assess the extent of water loss.  698 
For products  stored under refrigerated condit ions, when a significant chang e or out of specification  699 
occurs within the first 3 months  of testing  under accelerated conditions, a discussion should be provided 700 
to address the effect of shipment and handling ( refer to Section 14 – Labelling ). 701 
For synthetics, i t is considered unnecessary to continue to test a product under accelerated conditions 702 
through  6 months when a significant change has occurred within the first 3 months.  703

 7.4 Considerations for Frozen Temperature Storage  704 
Recommendations for drug substance and drug products intended for long -term storage under frozen 705 
conditions  (as determined  for the pro duct)  are provided below.  706

Testing at accelerated or stress conditions (e.g., 5°C ± 3°C or 25°C ± 2°C or 30°C ± 2°C or any 709 
appropriate condition based on the intrinsic properties of the drug substance or drug product) for an 710 
appropriate time period should be conducted to address the  effect of short -term excursions outside the 711 
proposed label storage condition (refer to Section 14.1 - Excursions Outside of a Labelling Claim ). 712 
8 PHOTOSTABILITY  713 
8.1 Purpose of Photostability Testing  714 
This section addresses the principles governing the generation of photostability information in initial 715 
regulatory submission and for lifecycle management changes.  716 
The intrinsic photostability characteristics of a product should be evaluated to demonstrate that light 717 
exposure does not result in unacceptable change th at could compromise product efficacy or patient 718 
safety. Normally, photostability testing is carried out on a single representative batch suitable for the 719 
purpose of the study. Repeating a photostability study may be required in response to relevant  changes  720 
(e.g., in the formulation, container closure system and in -use conditions) when the photostability 721 
characteristics and controls established at the time of the initial regulatory submission are assessed to 722 
be impacted (refer to Section 15.3 – Product Lifec ycle Stability Studies) . 723 
Two specific studies are performed to generate and evaluate photostability data : 724 
• Forced photo degradation study – A study that may be an integral part of  forced degradation 725 
evaluation  and may be undertaken in the development phase. This information may be used to 726 
evaluate the overall photosensitivity of the drug substance and drug product for method 727 
development purposes, degradation pathway elucidation and  to inform control strategies (refer 728 
to Section 2-Developmen t Stability Studies Under Stress and Forced Conditions) .  729 
• Confirmatory photostability studies – Studies performed when a risk of photodegradation has 730 
been identified. The purpose of the studies is to establish the photostability characteristics to 731 

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
34 
 understa nd the ability of the primary or secondary packaging material to protect light -sensitive 732 
products and the impact of light on product quality through manufacture, storage, transportation 733 
and in -use. These data may also support labelling (e.g., storage state ments).  734 
A systematic approach to photostability testing is recommended, covering as appropriate :  735 
i) Tests on the drug substance and/or drug product directly exposed; and if necessary.  736 
ii) Tests on the drug substance and/or drug product in the primary packaging;  and if necessary.  737 
iii) Tests on the drug substance and/or drug product in the secondary packaging.  738 
Normally, the studies are carried out in a sequential manner starting with testing the sample directly 739 
exposed then progressing as necessary to the drug substan ce and/or drug product in the primary 740 
packaging and then in the secondary packaging, if applicable. If the product is known to be 741 
photosensitive, e.g., most biologicals, parallel testing can be carried out as a science - and risk -based 742 
approach. The extent  of testing should be established by assessing whether acceptable change or no 743 
change has occurred at the end of the light exposure testing. Acceptable change is a change within limits 744 
previously justified by the applicant. If a non -acceptable change is ob served, a change in the packaging 745 
or the formulation should  be proposed. Testing should progress until the results demonstrate that the 746 
drug substance and/or drug product is adequately protected from exposure to light ( refer to Figure 3 - 747 
Decision Flow Chart for Systematic Photostability Testing).   748 

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
35 
 Figure 3:  Decision Flow Chart for Systematic Photostability Testing  749 
 750 
8.2 Forced Photo degradation  751 
As forced photodegradation is an integral part of forced degradation  strategy, details on the concepts, 752 
study design considerations and interpretation of results can be found in Section 2- Developmental 753 
Studies Under Stress and Forc ed Conditions.  For details on radiation sources and light exposure 754 
conditions for forced photo degradation studies refer to Section 8.4  – Radiation Source and Light 755 
Exposure .   756 
If the forced photodegradation study is combined with the confirmatory photost ability study , the 757 
specific sample considerations provided in Section 8.3 - Confirmatory Photostability  should be 758 
considered, e.g., for solid substances.  759 


ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
36 
 8.3 Confirmatory Photostability   760 
The confirmatory studies are used to determine whether special precautio nary measures are needed in 761 
manufacturing, formulation of the product, long -term storage or in -use period (refer to Section 1 1 - In- 762 
Use Stability ) and if a light -resistant container closure system and/or special labelling information are 763 
needed. Guidance i s provided on determining whether a confirmatory study should be performed, study 764 
design and interpretation of results (refer to Figure 3- Decision Flow Chart for Systematic Photostability 765 
Testing).  766 
For synthetic chemical entities, confirmatory photostability testing is generally performed on one batch 767 
of the drug substance and the drug product, while for biologicals, testing is generally performed on one 768 
batch of the drug product. Confirmatory tes ting is typically  conducted in the primary  container closure 769 
system and  including , if necessary,  secondary packaging. Alternative science - and risk -based 770 
approaches may be considered when appropriately justified and may in clude scenarios where 771 
confirmatory photostability testing is not required. For example, if no photodegradation is observed in 772 
the fully exposed drug substance sample or the fully exposed drug product sample, no further testing as 773 
part of the confirmatory s tudy is needed.  For some products where it has been demonstrated that the 774 
primary packaging is completely impenetrable to light (e.g., aluminium  tubes cans or foil/foil blisters) 775 
testing should normally only be conducted on directly exposed drug product.  776 
If the results from the confirmatory study batch are not conclusive in terms of photostability or 777 
photolability, testing of additional batches or a new study design should be considered.  778 
As a direct challenge for samples of solid products, an appropriate a mount of sample should be taken 779 
and placed in a glass or plastic dish spread in a single layer and protected with a suitable transparent 780 
cover, if considered necessary. Tablets and capsules should be spread in a single layer. Solids, except 781 
tablets or caps ules, should be spread across the dish to give a thickness of typically not more than 3 782 
millimetres . When direct exposure is not feasible (e.g., liquids, or products sensitive to non -light 783 
induced oxidation), the sample should be placed in a suitable prote ctive inert transparent container (e.g., 784 
quartz). In general, the samples should be positioned to provide maximum area of exposure to the light 785 
source.  786 
If testing of the drug product in the primary or secondary packaging  is needed, the samples should be 787 
placed horizontally or transversely with respect to the light source, providing the most uniform exposure 788 
of the samples. Some adjustment of testing conditions may have to be made when testing large -volume  789 
containers (e.g., dispensing packs). In general, sam ples with the greatest light exposure surface in the 790 
container should be tested.    791 

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
37 
 At the end of the exposure period, representative samples (taking homogeneity of light exposure into 792 
consideration) should be examined by analytical procedures (suitable fo r intended purpose) for any 793 
changes in physical, chemical or biological properties,  including  assay or potency and degradants that 794 
are determined from the characterisation studies that are likely to arise from photochemical degradation.   795 
When powder sample s are involved, sampling should ensure that a representative portion is used in 796 
individual tests. For solid oral dosage form products  (e.g., tablets, capsules) , testing should be conducted 797 
on a suitable number of units (statistical sampling approaches may be used). Similar sampling 798 
considerations, such as homogeneity or solubilisation of the entire sample, apply to other materials that 799 
may not be homogeneous after exposure (e.g., creams, ointments, suspensions).    800 
The analysis of the exposed sample should be performed concomitantly with that of any protected 801 
samples used as dark controls if these are used in the test. When evaluating the results of photostability 802 
studies to determine whether change due to exposure to light is acceptable, it is important to consider 803 
the results obtained from other formal stability studies to assure that the product will be within proposed 804 
specifications during the re -test period or shelf life. Depending on the extent of change or failure to 805 
meet acceptance criteria, special p recautions may be needed to mitigate exposure to light, like 806 
formulation change, redesign of container closure system (including secondary packaging), a reduced 807 
re-test period or shelf life of drug substance or drug product (in conjunction with long term stability 808 
data) or change in labelling for storage and use ( refer to Figure 3 - Decision Flow Chart for Systematic 809 
Photostability Testing ). 810 
8.4 Radiation Source and Light Exposure  811 
This section describes the radiation source and light exposure that can be used to support forced  812 
photodegradation studies and confirmatory photostability studies.  For forced degradation studies a 813 
variety of exposure conditions may be used, depending on the photosensitivity of the product and the 814 
intensity of the light sources used.  Co nfirmatory photostability studies should be based on light 815 
exposure possible during manufacture, storage, distribution and in -use.  816 
In photostability studies, it  is important to consider the spectral characteristics  of the light , cumulative 817 
light exposure and temperature, as the combination of these factors will influence the rate of 818 
photodegradation and the design of the study.  819 
The light sources described below are considered appropriate  for photostability testing.  Alternative 820 
light sources may be applica ble when justified. The applicant should either maintain appropriate 821 
temperature control to minimi se the effect of locali sed temperature changes or include a dark control in 822 
the same environment unless otherwise justified.  The applicant may rely on the sp ectral distribution 823 
specification of the light source manufacturer for the following options:  824 

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
38 
 Option 1:  825 
For light exposure similar to the D65 (outdoor daylight) emission standard (as currently defined in, 826 
ISO/CIE 18909:2022)  (17), an artificial daylight fluorescent lamp combining visible and ultraviolet 827 
(UV) outputs, xenon or metal halide lamp, including appropriate filter(s) is recommended as radiation 828 
light source.  829 
Option 2:  830 
A combined exposure to both cool white fluorescent and near ultraviole t lamp, which is capable of 831 
producing a light exposure similar to the ID65 (indoor daylight) emission standard, for which the 832 
ultraviolet lamp has at least 25% of the ultraviolet -A between 320 and 360 nm and at least 25% is 833 
between 360 and 400 nm.  834 
Option 3 : 835 
Ambient/mild light conditions (predominantly light >400  nm during manufacturing, processing and in - 836 
use), for which a fluorescent or LED lamp is recommended.  837 
Light exposure for forced photodegradation studies may require higher light intensity, such as do ubling 838 
the levels used in confirmatory studies. However, depending on the photosensitivity of the product, 839 
milder conditions may be more suitable to avoid extensive decomposition. For example, samples might 840 
be exposed to ambient/mild light conditions, typi cally ranging from 43 -260 ×103 lux hours for >400 nm 841 
and 0.3 -3 Wh/m2 for 350 – 400 nm, over an exposure period of 1 to 7 days.  842 
In confirmatory studies, to assess the effects of light under controlled conditions during manufacturing, 843 
storage and in use, sam ples maybe exposed to light providing an overall illumination of not less than 844 
1.2 million lux hours and an integrated near ultraviolet energy of not less than 200 Wh/m2.  When 845 
justified, alternate approaches may also be appropriate depending on the photos ensitivity of the product, 846 
the light source selected, manufacturing conditions and packaging.  The overall light exposure during 847 
manufacture can be determined by measuring the light exposure and defining the average light exposure 848 
and UV energy (e.g., in L uxh and/or Wh/m2). The average light exposure reading , with the worst -case 849 
light exposure time, could be used to define light exposure time and distance to light source 850 
considerations in the confirmatory study.   851

 9 STABILITY CONSIDERATIONS FOR PROCESSING AND HOLDING TIMES 852 
FOR INTERMEDIATES  853 
9.1 General Considerations  854 
Good manufacturing practices (GMP) and good distribution practices (GDP)  require that controls are 855 
in place  to ensure that intermediates (i.e., drug substance intermediates and drug product intermedia tes 856 
(including bulk drug products)) are manufactured and stored under appropriate conditions. Storage 857 
and/or transportation arrangements should not have deleterious effects on the subsequent processing, 858 
stability, safety, or quality of intermediates , in accordance with good distribution practices .   859 
The processing time can be considered as the established time period needed to perform a manufacturing 860 
step or series of steps  and should take into consideration compatibility with manufacturing equipment .  861 
Whereas the holding time can be considered as the established time period for which materials (e.g., 862 
dispensed raw materials, drug substance intermediates and drug product intermediates) are awaiting 863 
further processing or packaging in the final container clo sure system and may be held and/or transported 864 
under specified conditions. For such intermediates, maximum holding times should be established to 865 
ensure their quality and that they can be held, pending the next processing step, without having results 866 
outsi de the established control strategy . Intermediates should not be used beyond the established 867 
holding times.   A written protocol, procedure or program for the holding time studies should be 868 
followed taking into consideration the  principles described in Section 3.1 – General Principles .  869 
The data used to establish the holding time should cover the proposed holding times for the 870 
intermediates and the stability studies should be performed at relevant temperature and humidity 871 
conditions to support the expected s torage conditions for the drug substance or drug product 872 
intermediate. If the temperature and humidity conditions used during these studies do not correspond 873 
with the storage conditions described in Section 7 - Storage Conditions  of this guideline, other 874 
conditions should be justified . If the product is sensitive to light exposure that may occur during storage, 875 
data should confirm that controls are sufficient to limit exposure to acceptable levels as described in 876 
Section 8  - Photo stability .  If more than one production  site is involved, the stability studies should also 877 
consider transportation of the intermediates.  For consideration of reduced design, the principles of 878 
Annex 1  - Reduced Stability Protocol Design  may apply.  Cumulati ve hold times are generally assessed 879 
as part of process validation.  If a stability risk is identified , a cumulative holding time study may be 880 
necessary.   881 
For drug substance and drug product intermediates that are packaged and stored outside of the 882 
manufa cturing process activities or that are purchased as such, it may be appropriate to establish a re - 883 
test period or shelf life, as applicable, rather than a holding time. In these situations, the 884 

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
40 
 recommendations described in the respective sections within thi s guideline should be followed for the 885 
stability studies conducted to support the re -test period or shelf life with the corresponding storage 886 
statements.  887 
Stability recommendations for intermediates, including considerations that are specific for synthetic 888 
chemical entities and biological s, are described below.  889 
9.2 Considerations for Synthetic Chemical Entities  890 
The holding times of the drug substance intermediat es should consider GMP principles and comply 891 
with written procedures.  However, in situations where an in -process step for the drug substance has a 892 
holding time where the quality of the drug substance may be affected by the hold, then the principles in 893 
this section apply.  894 
When established, the processing times and maximum holding times for drug product intermediates 895 
should be included in the description of the manufacturing processes .  The risk assessment and control 896 
strategy for the drug product manufacturi ng processes should include an assessment of whether holding 897 
time studies should be performed. When applicable,  the information to support the processing and 898 
holding times should be included in the regulatory submission .  899 
When the holding times of a drug p roduct intermediate are prolonged (e.g., more than 30 days for solid 900 
dosage forms for the entire manufacturing process or more than 24 hours for  non-solid dosage forms  or 901 
sterile products), evidence of the suitability of the holding times, together with th e proposed container 902 
that is representative of that for marketing, the storage period or transportation arrangements, should be 903 
included in the regulatory submission , when requested. Where intermediates are transported between 904 
production  sites, the transpo rtation arrangements and method of transportation should be described in 905 
general terms (e.g., intermediate container, storage and transportation conditions) in the description of 906 
the manufacturing processes.  907 
For a drug substance or drug product produced b y batch processes (i.e., not by continuous 908 
manufacturing processes), it is expected that the data to support the holding times  is generated and is 909 
representative of the overall process.  If the data to support the holding times were not generated on 910 
produc tion scale batches, these data should be verified in post -approval stability commitment to conduct 911 
these studies on production scale batches. If continuous manufacturing processes are used, the principles 912 
outlined in ICH Q13 guideline should be followed when selecting batches to support holding times.    913 
9.3 Considerations for Biologic als 914 
During the manufacture of biological s, the quality and control of certain process intermediates may be 915 
critical to the production of the drug substance or drug product. In general, the manufacturer should 916 

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
41 
 identify process intermediates and generate data and define process limits and holding times that assure 917 
their stability within the conditions of the developed manufacturing process. Samples are periodically 918 
tested for product quality attributes that may be affected by the holding time.   919 
A holding time study for a biological  will typically c onsider two elements: (a) physicochemical stability 920 
and (b) microbial control strategy . The physicochemical stability part may be performed on small scale 921 
batches that are representative of production scale as part of process characterisation and should be  922 
assessed by monitoring relevant  CQAs, such as  purity and impurity . Microbial control should be 923 
demonstrated for the manufacturing process of production scale batches. The use of surrogate material 924 
as well as other approaches should be justified.  925 
When phy sicochemical and microbial hold times are determined from separate studies, the established 926 
hold time would be the shorter of the two times.  927 
When analytical procedures cannot be applied to an intermediate to determine its holding time, the 928 
adequacy of the holding time could be supported by evaluating the quality of the later stage 929 
intermediates, drug substance, or drug product.   930 
9.4 Examples of Holding Time Risk Assessment Considerations  931 
The following are examples of the stages that may be considered during the risk assessment of two 932 
different types of drug product manufacturing process . Depending on the dosage form, other stages and 933 
considerations could be relevant.  934 
9.4.1 Non-Sterile, Solid Oral Dosage Form  935 
The following  are examples of the stages that may be considered during the risk assessment of the drug 936 
product manufacturing processes for a for a non -sterile, solid oral dosage form  to identify potential 937 
processing and holding times for intermediates. Depending on the  dosage form, other stages and 938 
considerations could be relevant.  939

 941 
9.4.2 Sterile, Injectable Solution  942 
The f ollowing are examples of the stages that may be considered during the risk assessment of the 943 
manufacturing processes for a sterile, injectable solution to identify potential processing and holding 944 
times for intermediates:  945 
• Processing times at 15 -25°C during drug substance process to bulk drug substance  946 
• Frozen in -process materials   947 
• Processing time at room temperature (e.g., 15 -25°C) fr om start of drug product manufacturing 948 
(e.g., drug substance thaw) until end of fill  949 
10 SHORT -TERM STORAGE CONDITIONS  950 
The drug product labelling (refer to Section 14 – Labelling) may specify a short -term storage condition 951 
for a drug product. Short term storag e is a condition where the primary container closure is not breached 952 
and that is different form the long -term storage condition and the in -use period.  The short -term storage 953 
condition does not need to be implemented by the patient/health care professional,  as use of short -term 954 
storage is optional. The short -term storage condition is intended for convenience of the patient or health 955 
care professional in accordance with regional requirements based on anticipated storage of the drug 956 
product.  For example, a sh ort-term storage condition would enable a patient to store a refrigerated drug 957 
product at a room temperature condition for a specified duration of time.  In these cases, the short -term 958 
storage condition and duration should be stated on the labelling along with the long -term storage 959 
condition and shelf life.  The short -term storage condition is not intended to be applied beyond the shelf 960 
life of the drug product.   The short -term storage condition is different from any necessary manipulation 961 
(e.g., equilibra tion to ambient temperature) that would be required to prepare a drug for administration 962 
(e.g., as per relevant instructions in Instructions for Use).   If the drug product can be returned to long - 963 
term storage conditions after an acceptable period of short -term storage, data to support the short -term 964 
storage conditions should be provided as part of the primary stability studies.  A short -term storage 965 
condition is not required for all products. Once a short -term storage condition is established it does not 966 
need to be reevaluated periodically unless there is a change likely to impact stability.  967 
The design of specific short -term storage condition stability studies should follow the general principles 968 
applied to long -term stability studies (refer to Section 3 – Stability Protocol Design) and should consider 969 
all relevant climatic zones. Generally, a  minimum of 2 batches should be included in the study. The 970 
number of batches and the considerations for aged sample should be based on the general principles 971 

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
43 
 described for in -use stability studies (refer to Section 1 1.2.1 – Selection of Batches).    Additio nally, the 972 
applicant may justify alternative strategies, such as modelling ( refer to Annex 2 – Stability Modelling),  973 
to support the short -term storage condition.  974 
The applicant should demonstrate  that drug product with a proposed short -term storage condition will 975 
remain within the shelf life  specifications.  976 
11 IN-USE STABILITY  977 
11.1 Purpose of In -Use Stability Testing  978 
This section describes the principles for in -use stability testing for the purpose of esta blishing or 979 
confirming an in -use period and storage conditions, during which the quality of the drug product is 980 
maintained within the pre -defined acceptance criteria. In -use conditions are  defined as the conditions 981 
that mimic the intended use of the drug p roduct after the primary container is first breached and , where 982 
applicable, through preparation, storage and administration as per the relevant instructions. The 983 
principles outlined in this section are generally applied to single -dose drug products that ar e handled or 984 
prepared and stored prior to administration, including dilution, reconstitution or co -mixing , as well as 985 
single containers or combination s of a drug product with a medical device  containing drug product 986 
intended for multiple administrations or  doses. Products packaged in single -use containers for 987 
immediate use and not requiring preparation generally do not require an in -use period and would not be 988 
subject to in -use stability testing. Assembly of a combination  of a drug  product with a medical de vice 989 
for immediate use does not constitute preparation  in the context of in -use stability testing . 990 
For a drug product that may remain in contact with a delivery device during administration over time 991 
under conditions that differ from the proposed storage ( e.g., implantable infusion pump containing the 992 
drug product), an in -use study should demonstrate that the drug product remains stable and does not 993 
negatively impact the device delivering the drug during the in -use duration.  994 
The conditions of use for those products requiring preparation and for multi -dose products may pose a 995 
risk to quality of the drug product regarding physicochemical properties and/or microbiological 996 
contaminat ion. The regulatory submission  for these product s should include in -use stability data, upon 997 
which the in -use period and instructions are based. This section defines a core framework for 998 
establishing or confirming an in -use period and storage conditions, including selection of batches, study 999 
design, ana lytical procedures and acceptance criteria, that are applicable across multiple product types. 1000  
It is expected that the material in contact with the product and used in the preparation and administration 1001  
should be demonstrated to be compatible for use with the drug product.  1002  

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
44 
 Under some circumstances these studies may need to be  repeated if certain post -approval variations and 1003  
changes are made to the product (e.g., formulation, container closure system ). To determine  whether 1004  
these studies should be repeated , an assessment of change should be performed according to Section 1005  
15.2 - Risk Assessments and Confirmatory Studies to Support Post -Approval Changes.  1006  
11.2 In-Use Stability Study Protocol Design  1007  
The design of in -use stability study protocols should follow the gene ral principles outlined in Section 3 1008  
- Stability Protocol Design . The protocol should simulate the intended use of the product, as detailed in 1009  
the relevant instructions (e.g., for a multi -dose product stored in a vial, the in -use studies should 1010  
demonstrate  that the container closure system can withstand the conditions of repeated insertion and 1011  
withdrawal). When designing in -use studies, conditions under which a drug product could be used, 1012  
including the maximum time the drug product will be exposed to differ ent environmental factors during 1013  
use, should be considered. For samples requiring preparation, including reconstitution, dilution, or co - 1014  
mixing, the in -use studies should demonstrate the stability of the product through preparation and 1015  
handling under the specifi ed storage conditions for the maximum storage period.  The study duration, 1016  
conditions and selection of the analytical procedures  and acceptance criteria should  be justified as 1017  
suitable for demonstrating that product quality is maintained throughout the in‐use period.  Storage 1018  
conditions and withdrawal frequency sho uld, at minimum, reflect the instructions -for-use or may 1019  
consider a worst -case scenario.   1020  
Alternative (e.g., w orst-case) approaches to protocol design may be considered when appropriately 1021  
justified.  For example, for solid oral doses, the applicant may just ify the use of open dish studies  instead 1022  
of an in -use study.  1023  
11.2.1  Selection of Batches  1024  
Generally, in -use stability data should be provided on two batches of representative drug product. Based 1025  
on a risk assessment considering product knowledge and available prim ary stability data, alternative 1026  
approaches to batch selection may be considered when appropriately justified.  At least one of the 1027  
batches should be chosen towards the end of its shelf life. If such results are not available, one batch 1028  
should be tested at the final point of the submitted stability studies. If aged batch data are not available 1029  
at time of filing, a commitment to provide the data or a justification why those data may not  be required 1030  
based  on a risk assessment should be provided in the regulato ry submission . 1031  
All in -use stability batches should be provided in the container closure system proposed for commercial 1032  
use (e.g., multi -dose vial, assembled multi -dose combination  of a drug  product with  a medical device ), 1033  
or the administration set up. For drug products presented with different fill volumes, strengths, or 1034  

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
45 
 presentations , a representative, worst -case or, bracketing or matrixing approach may be applied with 1035  
justification (refer to Annex 1 – Reduced Stability  Protocol Design).    1036  
11.2.2  Selection of Analytical Procedures and Acceptance Criteria  1037  
The analytical procedures with acceptance criteria included in the study should be justified using a risk - 1038  
based approach that considers the CQAs most likely to change during t he proposed in -use period (refer 1039  
to Section 3.3 - Stability -Indicating Critical Quality Attributes ). The analytical procedures should be 1040  
suitable for the intended purpose and selected to demonstrate the physical, chemical and microbial 1041  
stability of the pro duct through the proposed in -use period.  1042  
For synthetic chemical entities, the physical and chemical quality attributes selected should be 1043  
appropriate to the individual dosage form and formulation. For example, attributes  such as colour, 1044  
odour, clarity, cl osure integrity, particulate matter, particle size, moisture content, drug substance 1045  
assay(s), degradation product level(s), dissolution, antimicrobial preservative and antioxidant 1046  
content(s), pH and viscosity, and microbial testing should be considered fo r testing, as applicable with 1047  
additional consideration s for risk associated with dosage form.  1048  
For biological s, the physical and chemical quality attributes selected should be appropriate to the 1049  
individual dosage forms ( 18). For example, physical and chemical quality attributes of protein content, 1050  
appearance, clarity, colour, visible particles and high molecular weight species should be tested, unless 1051  
otherwise justified,  while product -related variants or impurities and sub -visible particles should be 1052  
tested where applicable. Potency testing, or an analytical procedure covering the mode of action, should 1053  
be included where applicable and potential analytical limitations should be understood.  Microbial 1054  
stability  should be assesse d through the proposed in -use period for biologicals.  Common recommended 1055  
testing includes a Preservative Efficacy Test ( PET) / or Antimicrobial Effectiveness Test (AET),  or a 1056  
microbial enumeration method (e.g., bioburden) . In lower risk situations, it may be possible to justify 1057  
the absence of microbial testing where appropriately justified and based on an assessment of risk.  1058  
11.3 Labe lling of the in -use period and storage conditions  1059  
In-use stability data should be used to determine whether a declaration of an in -use period and storage 1060  
condition are necessary. The in -use period and storage conditions should be stated on the labelling in 1061  
accordance with regional regulations.  1062  
There may be scenarios where an established in -use period may not be needed  in the labelling. For 1063  
example, prepared orally administered  products, stored in multi -dose containers with a defined supply 1064  
that is intended for continuous use (not intermittent dosing), may not need to include an in -use period 1065  
on the labelling if the dem onstrated in -use stability data support storage for the intended use of the 1066  
product.  1067

 12 REFERENCE  MATERIALS, NOVEL EXCIPIENTS AND ADJUVANTS  1068  
This section covers stability considerations for reference materials, novel excipients (e.g., those used 1069  
for the first time in a drug product or through a new route of administration) and adjuvants. Novel 1070  
excipients and adjuvants are discussed due to their  significant potential impact on the quality of the drug 1071  
product.  1072  
Additives (e.g., stabili sers and preservatives) may degrade during the re -test period or shelf life of the 1073  
drug substance or the shelf life of the drug product. T hese materials (additives) should be monitored 1074  
during the stability program if there is an indication that their reaction, degradation, or depletion will 1075  
adversely affect the quality of the drug product.  Refer to Section 3.3 Stability -Indicating Critical Quality 1076  
Attributes  for gener al stability study design considerations.  1077  
12.1 Reference Materials  1078  
Reference materials (as defined in ICH Q2/Q14), that are used to control the quality attributes of a 1079  
stored intermediate, drug substance, or drug product should be sufficiently homogenous and st able to 1080  
ensure scientifically valid results are achieved. If the formulation, material composition , storage 1081  
condition  and/or container closure system for the reference material is different from the drug substance 1082  
or drug product, a specific reference mate rial stability program may be needed, with a n established  use 1083  
period  that reflect s the differences.  Externally sourced , well-characteri sed reference materials should  1084  
follow manufacturer recommendations for stability and storage and should be managed withi n the 1085  
quality management system  (e.g., pharmacopeial materials). Stability data should be available to 1086  
support the use period of the in -house reference material.  These data are generally provided with the 1087  
regulatory submission for biologicals and managed within the pharmaceutical quality syste m (PQS)  for 1088  
synthetics.  1089  
12.1.1  Considerations for Synthetic Chemical Reference Materials  1090  
The use period of a synthetic chemical drug substance, intermediate and drug product reference material 1091  
may be extended through acceptable stability data and requalification according to established control 1092  
strategy under a PQS.  A synthetic reference material may be stored under more conservative storage 1093  
conditions than the drug substance and drug product.  1094  
12.1.2  Considerations for Biological Reference Materials  1095  
The use period of a biological reference material, when kept under conditions used to store the 1096  
corresponding drug substance, intermediate or drug product, should generally be supported by available 1097  
long-term stability data. When a well -characterised drug substance or drug pr oduct is used as an in - 1098  
house  reference material and the storage conditions are the same as that used to store the drug substance 1099  

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
47 
 or drug product, the drug substance or drug product stability data may support the reference material  1100  
use period , without a nee d for additional reference material  specific stability testing.  1101  
Alternative storage conditions may extend the use period of in-house biological reference materials  1102  
beyond the re -test period or shelf life of the drug substance, intermediate, or drug produc t (e.g., 1103  
stabilising storage at a sufficiently lower temperature than the drug substance or drug product storage 1104  
condition). The alternative storage condition should be justified with its own long -term stability data or 1105  
a concurrent  stability testing strat egy that allows for a trend analysis of the data.  The reference material 1106  
use period may be extended through acceptable stability data according to a protocol (e.g., 1107  
qualification).  1108  
In situations where a drug substance or product’s stability -indicating cri tical quality attribute (e.g. , 1109  
potency) is being controlled relative to a reference material, a risk -based approach, including more 1110  
stringent stability acceptance criteria and trend analyses, should be considered for the reference 1111  
material’s stability to p revent drift in the stability profile of the drug substance or product.  1112  
12.2 Novel Excipients  1113  
Novel excipients should be evaluated for their impact on the stability of the drug product and relevant 1114  
information should be included in the regulatory submission fol lowing the recommendations described 1115  
in the applicable sections within this guideline ( refer to Section 3 - Stability Protocol Design , Section 6 1116  
-Testing Frequency and Section 7 - Storage Conditions ). If the excipient itself is a protein (e.g., albumin) 1117  
and used with a biological drug substance, additional risk assessments should be provided to clarify the 1118  
known degradation profile of the excipient and its impact on the biological drug substance or drug 1119  
product. For protein -based excipients, the drug product stability studies should address their potential 1120  
protein -excipient interaction, quantity of intact excipient in the drug product and impact on drug product 1121  
immunogenicity as well as their potential for masking process related impurities.  1122  
12.3 Vacci ne Adjuvants  1123  
Adjuvant stability data should be provided in the regulatory submissions  for vaccines. Stability of the 1124  
adjuvant should be assessed by formal stability studies .  If alternative strategies for determining stability 1125  
of the adjuvant are potential ly applicable , the applicant should consider early engagement with the 1126  
regulatory authority.  1127  
The stability studies will depend on the formulation/presentation, where vaccine drug product 1128  
formulated with the adjuvant will have different consideration to for mulations where the adjuvant is 1129  
provided in a separate vial to the vaccine drug product.  For adjuvants that are mixed with the drug 1130  
substance at the production site to derive the adjuvanted vaccine drug product, data that support shelf 1131  
life of the adjuvant ed vaccine in the primary container is required. In case of adjuvanted vaccines that 1132  

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
48 
 depend on antigen adsorption to the adjuvant (e.g., alum/antigen mixture) stability monitoring should 1133  
consider the degree of antigen adsorption/binding and extent of disso ciation of antigen from the 1134  
adjuvant upon storage, where relevant.  1135  
When the adjuvant and vaccine antigen (vaccine components) are supplied in separate containers, the 1136  
stability of each component should be assessed following appropriate pre -defined protoco ls that reflect 1137  
storage duration and storage conditions of each vaccine component.  1138  
The in -use stability of the adjuvant -antigen mixture should be assessed in the situation when the mixture 1139  
is not administered immediately after preparation and should be pe rformed at the intended in -use 1140  
conditions and period ( refer to Section 1 1 – In-Use Stability ). It is important to set appropriate 1141  
acceptance criteria to assess integrity of the adjuvant in the adjuvant/vaccine antigen mixture. The data 1142  
generated in the in -use stability studies will support the instructions for use of the admixed vaccine.  1143  
13 DATA EVALUATION   1144  
13.1 General Considerations  1145  
Stability data are obtained for multiple purposes through out the product lifecycle. A systematic 1146  
approach should be adopted in the p resentation and evaluation of the stability information. This section 1147  
focuses on the evaluation of stability data to establish  a re-test period or shelf life for drug substance 1148  
and the shelf life for drug product based on long-term data  at the recommended storage condition. Refer 1149  
to Section 3 - Stability Protocol Design , Table 1 for the minimum stability data at the time of 1150  
submission.  Alternatively, when there is limited long-term stability data at the recommended storage 1151  
condition, the re -test period or shelf life can be  proposed based on:  1152  
• Use of enhanced stability modelling methodologies to predict or extrapolate the stability profile 1153  
past the point of the available real -time data  (refer to Annex 2 – Section A2-2- Enhanced 1154  
Stability Modelling).  1155  
• Limited extrapolation of the real -time data for synthetic chemical entities that may be supported 1156  
by accelerated condition stability data using a decision tree approach. For biologic als, the 1157  
decision tree approach, which is based on the extent of attribute change at accelerated storage 1158  
conditions, is not considered suitable due to the inherent differences in degradation mechanisms 1159  
and other structure /function differences within biological s. 1160  
A comprehensive stability data evaluation should take into considera tion any stored intermediates, 1161  
process hold times, any short -term storage outside of the long -term storage conditions, including the 1162  
risk of excursions to the storage conditions and manipulations of the product to the completion of 1163  
administration to the pa tient (in -use stability).  1164  

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
49 
 Guidance is provided for the data evaluation of drug substance and drug product that have stability data 1165  
from at least three primary batches with batch as a single factor, and multi -factor products with full 1166  
design (for example, products with the same drug substance at different fill volumes, varied 1167  
concentration, container closure system dimensions , etc.).  In addition, t he degree of variability between 1168  
batches and other factors affect the confidence that a future produc tion batch will remain within 1169  
acceptance criteria throughout its re -test period or shelf life.   Multi -factor products with reduced design 1170  
studies are discussed in Annex 1 - Reduced Stability Protocol Design.  1171  
When the principles for extrapolation and modell ing are considered to apply to other product types , 1172  
such as ATMPs or vaccines , the applicant should seek early engagement with the regulatory authority.  1173  
13.1.1  Re-Test Period  1174  
A re-test period is normally applicable to drug substances of synthetic chemical entitie s as an alternative 1175  
to establishing a shelf  life. This approach may also be proposed in certain cases for the drug substances 1176  
of biological s with a well understood stability profile, where justified. An example where a re -test 1177  
period may apply for a biological  drug substance is a well characteri sed IgG therapeutic monoclonal 1178  
antibody that is stored frozen and shows  little to no change in prod uct quality over the duration of 1179  
storage.    1180  
13.1.2  Start of Shelf Life for Synthetic Chemical Entity Drug Products  1181  
The start of shelf life should be the date of production, which is defined as the date of the first 1182  
manufacturing step that combines drug substance  with other ingredients.  1183  
In accordance with  regional requirements , consider the following approaches : 1184  
• When the date of release is less than 30 days from the date of production, the start of shelf life 1185  
of a drug product batch could instead be calculated fr om the date of release of that batch.  1186  
• For drug products consisting of a drug substance as a single ingredient, filled into the final drug 1187  
product container, the initial date of the filling operation is taken as the date of production.  1188  
In the case of a drug product intermediate storage step before further processing  and when the start of 1189  
shelf life is not defined as described above, these should be declared and justified and included in the 1190  
drug product stability program of batches that represent the cum ulative maximum holding times of drug 1191  
product intermediates.    1192  
13.1.3  Start of Shelf Life for Biological  Drug Products  1193  
The start of shelf life for biological drug products begin on the date of manufacture e.g. , date of filtration 1194  
and/or filling for a liquid drug product.  When the drug product filling operation takes place over more 1195  

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
50 
 than one day, then the initial date of the filling operation is taken as the date of manufacture. Other 1196  
approaches used to define the start of shelf life can be used if justified.  1197  
13.2 Stati stical Evaluation of the Long -term Storage Condition Stability Profile to Establish 1198  
the Re -test Period or Shelf Life  1199  
All stability data from the primary and supportive stability studies should be evaluated to establish a re - 1200  
test period or shelf life. The s tatistical evaluation should include all primary stability studies, any 1201  
available production scale studies and supplemented , when applicable,  with additional supportive data 1202  
from batches  included in the stability programme  (refer to Section 4 - Selection o f Batches). The 1203  
stability profiles for the CQAs shown to potentially change over time at the recommended storage 1204  
conditions should be evaluated to establish the re -test period or shelf life. Each CQA should be assessed 1205  
separately,  and an overall assessment  should be made of findings for the purposes of proposing a shelf 1206  
life or re -test period. The re -test period or shelf life proposed should not exceed that predicted for any 1207  
single attribute.    1208  
Data from quantitative analytical procedures should be evaluat ed using appropriate statistical tools; 1209  
whereas results from semi -quantitative or qualitative analytical procedures, which may not be amenable 1210  
to statistical analysis, should also be evaluated. The degree of variability across individual batches and 1211  
the nu mber of data time -points affects the confidence that a future production batch will remain within 1212  
specification throughout the established re-test period or shelf life  (24).  1213  
There are many valid statistical methods to evaluate stability data to set a re-test period or shelf life 1214  
from batches of substances, intermediates, or products. The statistical methodology used should be 1215  
justified as suitable for the product type, the data set used for the analysis (batches, study design factors , 1216  
etc.) and the pur pose of the evaluation. The following sections outline selected, commonly used 1217  
approaches and do not cover all situations  (26, 27). 1218  
13.2.1  Linear Regression for an Individual Batch  1219  
Each primary batch, stored under the long -term conditions, may be evaluated indivi dually to establish 1220  
the re -test period or shelf life. Where there are differences in stability observed among batches or among 1221  
other factors or factor combinations that preclude the combining of data, the proposed re -test period or 1222  
shelf life should not ex ceed the earliest time (worst -case) period supported by any batch, other factor, 1223  
or factor combination. For quantitative attributes expected to change with time follow ing a linear pattern  1224  
or log transformed data that follow a linear pattern at the recommen ded storage condition, an approach 1225  
for evaluating the data is by linear regression analysis . The appropriateness of the assumed linear 1226  
relationship over time and normal distribution of the variables may be supported by evaluation of the 1227  
residuals for the r egression line (goodness of fit).  1228  

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
51 
 Analyses of a quantitative attribute can be performed by determining the earliest time at which the 95% 1229  
percent confidence limit for the mean intersects the proposed acceptance criterion. For attributes with 1230  
upper and low er acceptance criteria, a two -sided 95% confidence limit is recommended. The point at 1231  
which the confidence limits for the mean intersects the acceptance limit for each individual batch under 1232  
evaluation is generally determined ( illustrated in Annex -2 Stabil ity Modelling for an individual batch 1233  
example ). Using this approach, the upper and lower limits may each be evaluated individually as one - 1234  
sided limits against their respective upper and lower acceptance criteria.  For attributes with only a 1235  
lower or an upp er acceptance criterion, such as those for purity/impurity, a one -sided 95% confidence 1236  
limit is recommended.     1237  
Re-test period or shelf  life for individual batches should first be estimated with individual intercepts, 1238  
individual slopes and the pooled mean  square error calculated from all batches. If each batch has an 1239  
estimated re -test period or shelf life longer than that proposed, the proposed re -test period or shelf life  1240  
will generally be considered appropriate. If, however, one or more of the estimated re -test periods or 1241  
shelf lives are shorter than that proposed, a statistical test can be performed to determine whether the 1242  
batches can be combined to estimate a longer re -test period or shelf life.  1243  
13.2.2  Combining Batches  1244  
For the statistical evaluation, it may be advantageous to combine the data from different representative 1245  
batches into one overall estimate. A linear regression analysis provides a test for the parameters that 1246  
define the linear stability profile of an attribute from a single batch and whether they can be combined 1247  
to determine:  first the change over time or slope followed by the y -intercept. An appropriate statistical 1248  
approach should be prospectively defined and justified to evaluate the ability of combining data from 1249  
different batches  (22, 23). Refer to Annex 2  - Stability Model ling for additional statistical 1250  
considerations . A simulation study can be useful, if applicable, to demonstrate that the statistical 1251  
properties of the procedure selected are appropriate  (25). 1252  
13.2.3  Scale Transformation of Data  1253  
 When the degradation kinetics are complex and decelerating (e.g. , a biphasic degradation profile 1254  
characteri sed by fast initial rate followed by a slower longer -term rate o r when the data that may show 1255  
a plateauing profile), a linear regression analysis could be proposed when the linear regression provides 1256  
a worst -case shelf life or re -test period. The nature of the relationship between an attribute and time will 1257  
determine w hether data should be transformed for linear regression analysis.  The relationship can be 1258  
represented by a linear or non -linear function on an arithmetic or logarithmic scale. In some cases, a 1259  
non-linear regression can better reflect the true relationship . It should be noted that in some instances if 1260  
a linear function is fit to plateauing data, data points beyond the plateau could skew the regression line 1261  
towards later timepoints. Whereas this section describes linear regression analysis, other approaches 1262  

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
52 
 may be used (e.g. , nonlinear regression) with justification. When scale of transformation is used, 1263  
statistical methods should be prospectively employed to evaluate the goodness of fit on all batches and 1264  
combined batches (where appropriate) to the inferred degradation profil e. Transformation of a non - 1265  
linear model should be justified from a scientific perspective (e.g. , understanding of the attribute and/or 1266  
analytical procedure ). 1267  
13.2.4   Extrapolation and Stability Modelling  1268  
Extrapolation is the practice of using a known data set to infer information about future data and is a 1269  
form of stability modelling that, under certain conditions, may be applicable to synthetics and 1270  
biological s.  Extension of shelf life beyond the period covered by long -term data, by extrapolation, can 1271  
be propose d in the regulatory submission . Whether extrapolation of stability data is appropriate depends 1272  
on the extent of understanding for the product type, relevant knowledge about the stability -indicating 1273  
attributes and any change over time, the goodness of fit o f any mathematical or other computational 1274  
model type, and the existence of relevant supporting data that may include additional timepoints, 1275  
additional batches or prior knowledge . Relevant supporting data include satisfactory long -term data 1276  
from development  batches that are (1) made with a comparable formulation to, (2) manufactured on a 1277  
smaller scale than, or (3) packaged in a container closure system similar to that of the primary stability 1278  
batches.  1279  
For synthetics, certain quantitative chemical attributes (e.g., assay, chemical degradation products, 1280  
preservative content) for a drug substance or product can generally be assumed to follow zero -order 1281  
kinetics during long -term storage. Although the kinetics of other quantitative attributes (e.g. , pH, 1282  
dissolutio n) are generally not known, the same statistical analysis can be applied, if appropriate. 1283  
Qualitative attributes and microbiological attributes are not amenable to this kind of statistical analysis.  1284  
The decision tree approach would not be recommended for biological products because b iological and 1285  
immunological attributes are generally not amenable to extrapolation , as they cannot be assumed to 1286  
follow zero order kinetics. For certain well characterised biologicals  that have n o statistically significant 1287  
or m eaningful change over time , extrapolation may be possible using the risk assessment criteria and 1288  
supporting long term development data, as outlined in Section 13. 2.9 – Extrapolation of Biologicals .  1289  
An extrapolation of stability data assumes that the same change profile will continue to apply beyond 1290  
the period covered by available long -term data and should be applicable to future batches. The 1291  
correctness of the assumed change profile is a critical consideration, especially when stability data are 1292  
limited. A ny extrapolation should be justified and have a science -based rationale that may be based on 1293  
prior knowledge.  1294  
The methodologies outlined in  this section  may be used to extrapolate the long -term stability data.  1295  
When estimating a regression line or curve to fit the long -term data, the data themselves provide a check 1296  

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
53 
 on the correctness of the assumed change pattern, and statistical methods should be applied  to evaluate 1297  
the goodness of fit (or an equivalent valid statistical method) of the existing data to the inferred line or 1298  
curve and to provide confidence that future batches will lie within the inferred stability profile ( refer to 1299  
Annex 2 , Section A2-1 - Statistical Evaluation of Stability Data from Single or Multi -factor Study 1300  
Designs) . No such internal check is possible beyond the period covered by long -term data from primary 1301  
batches, though an inferred trend may be supported by prior knowledge.  1302  
Enhanced  stability modelling , such as those referenced in Annex 2 (Annex 2 - Section A2-2 Enhanced 1303  
Stability Modelling) may also be considered.  1304  
Any shelf life or re -test period proposed based on extrapolation should be verified by additional long - 1305  
term stability da ta as these data become available.  1306  
13.2.5  Extrapolation  for Synthetic  Chemical Entitie s  1307  
A systematic approach using a decision tree (Figure 4) is provided as a tool for appropriate data 1308  
extrapolation beyond the period covered by long -term stability data. The decision tree is intended to 1309  
apply to synthetic chemical entities that are  stored long -term at room temperature or refrigerated 1310  
conditions and that have stability data at an accelerated storage condition in addition to the long -term 1311  
stability data. The decision tree is not intended for other products or other long -term condition s (e.g. , 1312  
biological s or frozen storage). The decision tree provides a complementary approach to the statistical 1313  
analysis of long -term stability data. The decision tree approach may provide some limited extrapolation 1314  
though greater extrapolation beyond thes e stated limits may be possible using other modelling 1315  
methodologies ( refer to Annex 2 –Stability Modelling).  1316  
To use the decision tree, the variability between and within batches should allow reasonable confidence 1317  
that the stability profile meets the attrib ute specification at the proposed re -test period or shelf life under 1318  
the recommended storage conditions. The term “room temperature” refers to the general customary 1319  
environment and should not be inferred to be the storage statement for labelling  (refer to Section 14 – 1320  
Labelling) . 1321  

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
54 
 Figure 4: Decision Tree for Data Evaluation for Re -test Period and Shelf Life Estimation for 1322  
Synthetic Chemical Entity Drug Substances and Drug Products (excluding frozen 1323  
products)  1324  
 1325  
 1326  
When the decision tree is used for extrapolation, each attribute on the s helf life specification should be 1327  
systematically evaluated. The assessment should begin with any significant change at the accelerated 1328  
condition and, if appropriate, at an intermediate conditi on, and progresses through the trends and 1329  
variability of the long -term data. The circumstances are delineated under which extrapolation of re -test 1330  


ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
55 
 period or shelf life beyond the period covered by long -term data can be appropriate. If any attribute that 1331  
is not quantifiable shows potential for significant change at the accelerated storage condition, then the 1332  
decision tree cannot be used.  1333  
The following subsections describe the decision tree approach,  and the scenarios illustrated.  1334  
13.2.6  No Significant Change at Ac celerated Condition  1335  
Where no significant change occurs at the accelerated condition, the re -test period or shelf life would 1336  
depend on the nature of the long -term and accelerated data. This applies to room temperature and 1337  
refrigerated drug substances and dr ug products where no significant change occurs at the accelerated 1338  
condition . 1339  
13.2.6.1  Long -term and Accelerated Data Show Little to No Change Over Time and Little or 1340  
No Variability (Scenario A)  1341  
Where the long -term data and accelerated data for an attribute show lit tle or no change over time and 1342  
little or no variability, it might be apparent that the drug substance or product will remain well within 1343  
the acceptance criteria for that attribute during the proposed re -test period or shelf life. In these 1344  
circumstances, a statistical analysis is normally considered unnecessary but justification for the 1345  
omission should be provided. Justification can include a discussion of the change pattern or lack of 1346  
change, relevance of the accelerated data, mass balance , and/or other sup porting data. Extrapolation of 1347  
the re -test period or shelf life beyond the period covered by long -term data can be proposed. The 1348  
proposed re -test period or shelf life can be up to two times  for products stored at room temperature , but 1349  
should not be more th an 12 months beyond, the period covered by long -term data. For refrigerated drug 1350  
substances or drug products, if the long -term and accelerated data show little change over time and little 1351  
variability, the proposed re -test period or shelf life can be up to one-and-a-half times, but should not be 1352  
more than 6 months beyond the period covered by long -term data.  1353  
13.2.6.2  Long -term or Accelerated Data Show Change Over Time and/or Variability 1354  
(Scenario B)  1355  
The decision tree approach considers the significance of change over  time under accelerated and long - 1356  
term storage conditions and method variability.  For a synthetic chemical drug substance, a significant 1357  
change is when an attribute exceeds specification at the accelerated condition within 6 months or long - 1358  
term storage con dition within the intended shelf life or re -test period.  For drug product, a significant 1359  
change has additional considerations applicable to synthetic chemical products including:  1360  
(1) 5% change in assay from its initial value  1361  
(2) failure to meet the speci fication for degradation products, physical attributes (e.g., colour, phase 1362  
separation, re -suspend ability , caking, hardness) and, when applicable functionality tests (e.g., dose 1363  
delivery per actuation);  1364  

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
56 
 and for certain dosage forms:  1365  
(3) failure to meet specification for pH  1366  
(4) failure to meet specification for dissolution testing    1367  
With respect to physical  attribute changes, the following can be expected to occur at the accelerated 1368  
condition and would not be considered significant change that calls for intermediate testing if there is 1369  
no other significant change:  1370  
• softening of a suppository that is design ed to melt at 37 °C, if the melting point is clearly 1371  
demonstrated,  1372  
• failure to meet acceptance criteria for dissolution of a gelatin e capsule or gel -coated tablet if the 1373  
failure can be unequivocally attributed to cross -linking.  1374  
However, if phase separati on of a semi -solid dosage form occurs at the accelerated condition, testing at 1375  
an intermediate condition should be performed. Potential interaction effects (e.g. , other drug product 1376  
components) should also be considered in establishing that there is no sig nificant change.  1377  
For product intended to be stored at room temperature, when a significant change is observed or 1378  
anticipated at a particular accelerated storage condition, consider including an intermediate storage 1379  
condition in the protocol and for the da ta evaluation.  An appropriate intermediate storage condition, as 1380  
applied to a synthetic chemical entity, depends on the climatic zones intended for the product (refer to 1381  
Section 7 – Storage Conditions).  1382  
If the long -term or accelerated data for an attribute show change over time and/or variability within a 1383  
factor or among factors (e.g., strength, container size and/or fill), statistical analysis of the long -term 1384  
data can be useful in establishing a re -test period or shelf life. When there are differences in stability 1385  
observed across batches or among other factors or factor combinations (e.g., strength, container size 1386  
and/or fill) that preclude the combining of data, the proposed re -test period or shelf life  should not 1387  
exceed the shortest period supported by any batch, other factor, or factor combination. Alternatively, 1388  
where the differences are readily attributed to a particular factor (e.g., strength), different shelf lives can 1389  
be assigned to different leve ls within the factor (e.g., different strengths). A discussion should be 1390  
provided to address the cause for the differences and the overall significance of such differences on the 1391  
product. Extrapolation beyond the period covered by long -term data can be pro posed; however, the 1392  
extent of extrapolation would depend on whether long -term data for the attribute are amenable to 1393  
statistical analysis.  1394  
13.2.6.3  Data not amenable to statistical analysis (Scenario B.I)  1395  
Where long -term data are not amenable to statistical analys is (e.g., colour, clarity using qualitative or 1396  
semi -quantitative methods), but change over time and relevant supporting data are provided, the 1397  

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
57 
 proposed re -test period or shelf life at room temperature storage can be up to one and -a-half times but 1398  
should no t be more than 6 months beyond the period covered by long -term data. For refrigerator storage, 1399  
the proposed re -test period or shelf  life can be up to 3 months beyond the period covered by long -term 1400  
data.  1401  
13.2.6.4  Data amenable to statistical analysis (Scenario B.I I) 1402  
If long -term data are amenable to statistical analysis but no analysis is performed, the extent of 1403  
extrapolation should be the same as when data are not amenable to statistical analysis. However, if a 1404  
statistical analysis is performed, it can be appropr iate to propose a re -test period or shelf life when stored 1405  
at room temperature of up to twice but not more than 12  months beyond the period covered by long - 1406  
term data, when the proposal is supported by the result of the analysis and relevant supporting data . For 1407  
refrigerated chemical entities, w here statistical analysis is performed, the proposed re -test period or 1408  
shelf life can be up to one -and-a-half times, but should not be more than 6 months beyond, the period 1409  
covered by long -term data.   1410  
13.2.7  Significant Change at Accelerated Condition  1411  
Where significant change occurs at the accelerated condition, the re -test period or shelf life would 1412  
depend on the storage condition (room temperature or refrigerated) and if stability data at an 1413  
intermediate condition are avai lable.  1414  
13.2.7.1  Significant Change at Accelerated Condition (refrigerated storage) (Scenario C)  1415  
For refrigerated storage, if significant change occurs at the accelerated storage condition, the proposed 1416  
re-test period or shelf life should be based on the long -term data and extrapolation is generally not 1417  
considered appropriate.  Intermediate conditions are also not considered appl icable for products stored 1418  
at refrigerated storage conditions . In addition, a re -test period or shelf life shorter than the period 1419  
covered by long -term data could be proposed in a science - and risk-based  manner . If the long -term data 1420  
show variability, veri fication of the proposed re -test period or shelf life by statistical analysis can be 1421  
appropriate .  1422  
13.2.7.2  Significant Change at Accelerated Condition and Significant Change at Intermediate 1423  
Condition (room temperature storage) (Scenario D)  1424  
Where significant change  occurs at both accelerated and the intermediate condition, the proposed re - 1425  
test period or shelf life should be based on the long -term data and extrapolation is generally not 1426  
considered appropriate.  In addition, a re -test period or shelf life shorter than  the period covered by 1427  
long-term data could be proposed in a science - and risk-based  manner. If the long -term data show 1428  
variability, verification of the proposed re -test period or shelf life by statistical analysis can be 1429  
appropriate.   1430  

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
58 
 13.2.7.3  Significant Change at Accelerated Condition and No Significant Change at 1431  
Intermediate Condition (room temperature storage) (Scenario E ) 1432  
If there is significant change at accelerated condition but no significant change at the intermediate 1433  
condition, extrapolation beyond the p eriod covered by long -term data can be proposed; however, the 1434  
extent of extrapolation would depend on whether long -term data for the attribute are amenable to 1435  
statistical analysis.  1436  
13.2.7.3.1  Data not amenable to statistical analysis (Scenario E.I)  1437  
When the long -term data for an attribute are not amenable to statistical analysis, the proposed re -test 1438  
period or shelf life can be up to 3 months beyond the period covered by long -term data, if supported by 1439  
relevant supporting data.  1440  
13.2.7.3.2  Data amenable to statistical analysis (Scenario E.II)  1441  
When the long -term data for an attribute are amenable to statistical analysis but no analysis is 1442  
performed, the extent of extrapolation should be the same as when data are not amenable to statistical 1443  
analysis. However, if a statistical anal ysis is performed, the proposed re -test period or shelf life can be 1444  
up to one -and-half times, but should not be more than 6 months beyond, the period covered by long - 1445  
term data, when backed by statistical analysis and relevant supporting data.  1446  
13.2.8  Extrapolatio n for Chemical Entities when Stored Frozen   1447  
When a drug substance or product is stored frozen, with no observable or no statistically significant 1448  
change over time for the available data of all quality attributes monitored at the recommended storage 1449  
conditions or a minor change that remains well within the acceptance criteria, extrapolation may be 1450  
considered based on appropriate prior knowledge and enhanced stability modelling ( Annex 2 –Stability 1451  
Modelling ).  1452  
13.2.9  Extrapolation for Biologicals  1453  
Extrapolation beyond the period covered by available long -term primary stability data may be 1454  
considered for a well characterised biologic al drug substance stored frozen, for which the quality 1455  
attributes are known, and their corresponding criticality and re sidual risks evaluated to ensure patient 1456  
safety.  Extrapolation of drug substance shelf life should be limited to one and a half  times the available 1457  
long-term data from the primary stability batches to a maximum of 12 months beyond available long - 1458  
term data,  when justified.   Justification should include a risk -based approach to fully support the 1459  
proposed extrapolation, including data available on batches that have long term data to the end of the 1460  
proposed shelf life that are analytically comparable to primary  batches. Justification should also include 1461  
statistical analysis (such as using linear regression with 95% confidence limit) of available long -term 1462  
data on representative batches and primary stability batches to show no statistically significant or 1463  
meaning ful change over time.  Any observable trend should also be justified.  In addition, the risk 1464  
assessment should take into consideration other aspects such as, knowledge of the molecule and its 1465  

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
59 
 degradation profile, impact of degradation of the molecule on dru g product, knowledge of the impact 1466  
on stability due to the rate of freezing and thawing of the drug substance, the container/closure system, 1467  
drug substance concentration and formulation to support the extrapolation.  1468  
Alternative approaches can be proposed and justified for extrapolation and/or shelf life prediction based 1469  
on appropriate prior knowledge and enhanced stability modelling ( Annex 2 –Stability Modelling ).   1470  
The general principles outlined here for drug substance extrapolation may be applicable to drug product 1471  
extrapolation, however, due to increased risk, applicants are encouraged to seek agreement with 1472  
regulatory authorities on the extrapolation proposal and accompanying justification that includes 1473  
potential impact to patient safety and efficacy.   Additionally, for biological drug products, applicants 1474  
are encouraged to consider enhanced mode lling techniques as described in Annex 2  – Stability 1475  
Modelling .   1476  
For biologicals and synthetics, w hen the proposed shelf life is extrapolated beyond available long-term 1477  
data from primary stability studies, the primary stability studies should be continued post -approval to 1478  
confirm the shelf life with long -term data. The ongoing monitoring/trending of stability data should be 1479  
managed by the manufacturer’s  PQS. The  PQS should be capable of detecting and managing any 1480  
confirmed changes in stability trend and out of specification results with appropriate corrective action 1481  
and preventive actions (CAPA)  as described in ICH Q10, relevant to any extrapolation being applied .  1482  
13.3 Data Evaluation for Multi -factor, Full -design Studies  1483  
The stability of the drug product, or drug substance if applicable, could differ to a certain degree among 1484  
different factor combinations in a multi -factor, full -design study, for example, products wi th different 1485  
fill volumes or content and different container dimensions. Two approaches can be considered when 1486  
analysing such data.  1487  
• To determine whether the data from all factor combinations (e.g ., fill volume and container 1488  
dimensions such as vial size), s upport the proposed shelf life for each combination of drug 1489  
product presentation.  1490  
• To determine whether the data from different factor combinations can be combined for an 1491  
overall estimate of a single shelf life that applies to each presentation.  1492  
A statistic al model that includes all appropriate factors and factor combinations may be constructed and 1493  
the shelf life should be estimated for each factor and for all factor combinations to support the product 1494  
shelf life.   1495  
If all shelf lives estimated by the aforem entioned statistical  model are longer than the proposed shelf 1496  
life, further model building is considered unnecessary, and the proposed shelf life will generally be 1497  

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
60 
 appropriate for all combinations of factors. The stability data from different factors shoul d not be 1498  
combined unless supported by scientific understanding and statistical testing.  1499  
13.3.1  Testing to Combine Batch Data per Individual Combination  1500  
If each factor combination is considered separately, the stability data can be statistically tested to 1501  
combine those batch data for each individual combination. The shelf life for each non -batch factor 1502  
combination can be estimated separately by applying the procedure described for single factor, full 1503  
design  (Refer to Annex 2, Section A2-1 – Statistical Eval uation of Stability Data from Single or Multi - 1504  
Factor Study Designs) . For example, for a drug product available in two strengths and four container 1505  
sizes, eight sets of data from the 2 x 4 strength -size combinations can be analysed  and eight separate 1506  
shelf lives should be estimated accordingly. For a single shelf life across the strengths and container 1507  
sizes, the shortest (worst -case) estimated shelf life among all factor combinations should become the 1508  
shelf life for the product.  However, this approach does  not consider all the available data from all factor 1509  
combinations, thus generally resulting in shorter shelf lives than the approach that combines batches for 1510  
all factors and factor combinations.  1511  
13.3.2  Testing to Combine Data  for All Factors  and Factor Combinati ons 1512  
If the stability data are tested to combine all factors and factor combinations and the results show that 1513  
the data can be combined, a single shelf life across all combinations and longer than that estimated 1514  
based on individual factor combinations may b e proposed.  The shelf life is longer because the width 1515  
of the confidence limit(s) for the mean will become narrower as the amount of data increases when 1516  
batches, strengths, container sizes and/or fills, etc. are combined into a single analysis of covarian ce 1517  
(e.g., ANCOVA).  1518  
Analysis of covariance (e.g ., ANCOVA) can be employed to test the difference in slopes and intercepts 1519  
of the regression lines among factors and factor combinations. The purpose of the procedure is to 1520  
determine whether data from multiple factor combinations can be combined for the estimation of a 1521  
single shelf life that could apply to all 8 presentations for the previous example (refer to Section 13. 3.1 1522  
- Testing to Combine Batch Data  per Individual Combination ). 1523  
The full statistical model should include the y -intercept and slope terms for all main effects and 1524  
interaction effects and a term reflecting the random error of measurement.  If it can be justified that the 1525  
higher order interactions are very small, there is generally no need to incl ude these terms in the model.  1526  
In cases where the analytical results at the initial time point are obtained from the dosage form prior to 1527  
its packaging, the effect of container is taken into account in each measure as comparisons are made to 1528  
the initial ti me point analysed  prior to packaging.   1529  

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
61 
 The tests to combine data should be specified to determine whether there are statistically significant 1530  
differences among factors and factor combinations. Generally, the statistical tests for covariance should 1531  
be performed in a proper order such that the sl ope terms are tested before the intercept terms and the 1532  
interaction effects are tested before the main effects. For example, the tests can start with the slope and 1533  
then the intercept terms of the highest order interaction and proceed to the slope and then the intercept 1534  
terms of the simple main effects. The most reduced model, obtained when all remaining terms are found 1535  
to be statistically significant, can be used to estimate the shelf life.  1536  
All tests should be conducted using appropriate levels of signific ance (refer to Annex 2 – Stability 1537  
Modelling ). Typically,  a significance level of 0.25 can be used for batch -related terms, and a 1538  
significance level of 0.05 can be used for non -batch -related terms.  If the tests show that the data from 1539  
different factor comb inations can be combined, the shelf life can be estimated according to the 1540  
procedure described for a single batch  (refer to Section 13.2.1  – Linear Regression for an Individual 1541  
Batch ), using the combined data.  1542  
If the tests show that the data from certain f actors or factor combinations should not be combined , then 1543  
a single shelf life can be estimated based on the shortest estimated shelf life among all levels of factors 1544  
and factor combinations remaining in the model.  1545  
After model selection and implementation,  model lifecycle consideration should be considered per  1546  
Annex 2 - Stability Modelling,  Section 2. 7 – Risk Management  and Model Lifecycle Considerations . 1547  
13.4  Data Presentation  1548  
The applicant should follow ICH M4Q for data presentation expectations. In general, for stability data, 1549  
data for all attributes should be presented in an appropriate format (e.g. , tabular, graphical, narrative) 1550  
and an evaluation of such data. The values of quantitative attributes at all time points should be reported 1551  
as measured and as calculated to support the label claim, where applicable. If a statistical analysis is 1552  
performed, the procedure used and the assumptions underlying the model should be stated and justified.  1553  
14 LABELLING   1554  
Guidance for labelling and storage statements for drug substances and drug products are provided 1555  
below. Note that  the same principles should be applied to stored intermediates when applicable.  1556  
A storage statement should be established for the labelling based on the evaluation of stability d ata with 1557  
respect to the climatic zone where the drug substance and/or drug product are intended to be stored, 1558  
shipped, or used.  When applicable, storage statements should reflect information related to the in -use 1559  
period and storage conditions . It is recom mended that an appropriate temperature range be included on  1560  
the label . Terms such as “ambient conditions’ or “room temperature” should be avoided  on the label . 1561  

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
62 
 Where applicable , specific instructions should be provided within  the labelling , particularly fo r drug 1562  
substances, intermediates and drug products that cannot tolerate freezing and thawing, exposure to light 1563  
or humidity. Additional information may be included  on the label for drug products with an established 1564  
short -term storage condition ( refer to Se ction 1 0 – Short -Term Storage Conditions ).  1565  
There should be a direct link between the label storage statements and the demonstrated stability. An 1566  
expiration date/re -test date, derived from the stability information, should be displayed on the container 1567  
closure system labelling, as appropriate.   1568  
14.1 Excursions Outside of a Labelling Claim  1569  
The quality attributes of pharmaceutical drug substances and drug products can be impacted by the 1570  
extent of the environmental factors experienced during handling, transport, and storage. Those impacts 1571  
should be evaluated and specified instructions may be provided on the product labelling.   1572  
Transient temperature excursions outside of the label storage conditions, may be acceptable if justified 1573  
and supported by stabil ity data.  An assessment of the risk and impact of handling, transport,  and storage 1574  
excursions outside the label claim  at various stages throughout the overall supply chain requires a 1575  
comprehensive knowledge of the supply chain and an understanding of a dru g substance and drug 1576  
product’s stability profile. Data from stability studies, including accelerated studies, stress  testing ( Refer 1577  
to Section 2  – Development Studied Under Stress and Forced Conditions ), or transport simulation 1578  
studies  (when appropriate)  can be used to evaluate the effects of an excursion on the drug substance or 1579  
drug product. Additionally, statistical evaluation or modelling can be leveraged to evaluate the impact 1580  
of a storage condition excursion , provided sufficient knowledge of the degra dation pathway is available 1581  
and fits an appropriate model. Each excursion should be documented and handled within the 1582  
corresponding quality management system or appropriate risk assessment.  1583  
  1584  

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
63 
 15 STABILITY CONSIDERATIONS FOR COMMITMENTS AND PRODUCT 1585  
LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT  1586  
Consistent with ICH Q8, the product lifecycle includes all phases in the life of a drug substance and 1587  
drug product from the initial development through the marketing until the product’s discontinuation. 1588  
Lifecycle management in the cont ext of stability includes initial stability testing and re-test period and 1589  
shelf life  determination, ongoing (annual) stability testing, and stability studies supporting post - 1590  
approval changes or commitments over a product’s lifecycle . This also includes  the introduction of  new 1591  
dosage forms or new strengths/concentrations . Commitment stability studies include studies to confirm 1592  
the initial ly proposed  re-test period/shelf life for commercial manufacture. This section also provides 1593  
guidance on stability studie s necessary to support the product lifecycle after an initial re -test period or 1594  
shelf life has been established in the regulatory submission . While guidance in this section is focused 1595  
on product lifecycle management of drug substances and drug products , general principles may also 1596  
apply to intermediates that require studies to support re -test period/shelf life or holding times.  1597  
In cases where data from commitment stability studies fall outside the acceptance criteria, as confirmed 1598  
through quality investiga tion, the stability commitment should include a proposed action to the 1599  
competent authority in accordance with regional requirements.   1600  
15.1 Commitment Stability Studies  1601  
Commitment stability studies are conducted under the accelerated, intermediate, or long -term storage 1602  
conditions (as applicable) to establish or confirm the initial re -test period or shelf life. Where the 1603  
primary stability studies for a drug substance or drug product do not cover the proposed re -test period 1604  
or shelf life  period granted at the time  of initial approval, a commitment should be made to continue the 1605  
stability studies to confirm the proposed re -test period or shelf life. If applicable, data supporting the 1606  
claim that manufacturing scale does not impact stability of the product should be p rovided for regulatory 1607  
assessment. When all the batches used in the primary stability studies are production batches and 1608  
stability data cover proposed re -test period and/or shelf life, a post -approval commitment is considered 1609  
unnecessary.  Otherwise, one of  the following commitments should be made:  1610  
• If the regulatory  submission includes long -term data from stability studies less than the re -test 1611  
period/ shelf life  for at least three production batches, a commitment should be made to continue 1612  
these studies through the proposed re -test period/ shelf life . 1613  
• If the regulatory  submission includes data from stability studies on fewer than three production 1614  
batches, a commitment  stability study should be conducted to generate stability data on at least 1615  
three production scale batches  in total . Commitment stability studies under the long -term 1616  
storage conditions should be initiated or continued though the proposed re -test period and /or/ 1617  
shelf life  and, if applicable, under the accelerated storage conditions through to 6 months.  1618  

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
64 
 • For synthetics, i f the regulatory  submission does not include stability data on production 1619  
batches, a commitment stability study should be conducted to genera te stability data on at least 1620  
three production scale batches. Commitment stability studies under the long -term storage 1621  
conditions should be initiated and continued th rough the proposed re -test period and/or shelf 1622  
life and, if applicable, under the accelera ted storage conditions through to 6 months.  1623  
The commitment stability study protocol should be the same as that for the primary stability study, 1624  
unless otherwise scientifically justified. Continuation or application of new bracketing or matrixing 1625  
approaches  in the commitment stability studies for the stability commitment should also be justified as 1626  
discussed in Annex 1 - Reduced Stability Protocol Design .  1627  
15.2 Ongoing Stability Studies  1628  
Ongoing stability studies are conducted under long -term storage conditions on  an annual basis to ensure 1629  
the consistency of stability related quality attributes at the commercial storage conditions over the 1630  
product lifecycle. These studies also allow for the monitoring of the stability characteristics and examine 1631  
trends in the stabi lity data to confirm the appropriate storage conditions relevant for the product and to 1632  
confirm a re -test period or a shelf life.  1633  
In accordance with the general principles in ICH Q7, at least one production batch of the drug substance 1634  
and one production ba tch of each strength of the drug product covering the container closure systems 1635  
should be added to the ongoing stability program per year (unless none is produced that year). Ongoing 1636  
stability studies are generally managed within the PQS unless a regulator y authority expects additional 1637  
submission of the information and data. Each production site  should maintain an ongoing stability 1638  
programme in accordance with GMPs. Reduced designs (as discussed below and in Annex 1 - Reduced 1639  
Stability Protocol Design ) can be applied where justified.  1640  
Ongoing stability studies are not required to align with the primary stability protocol;  however, testing 1641  
should continue through to the end of the re -test period or shelf life .  As product knowledge is gained, 1642  
the applicant may consider removal of testing of attributes not related to stability and/or reduce testing 1643  
timepoints based on risk assessment as detailed in Section 3 - Stability Protocol Design.   Reductions, 1644  
including br acketing and/or matrixing approaches, based on stability knowledge and risk assessment 1645  
should be justified in the regulatory submission , where applicable, as detailed in Annex 1 (Reduced 1646  
Stability  Protocol Design).  Reduced protocol designs applied in the o riginal regulatory submission  1647  
should be followed until there is a change in configuration (e.g., strength/concentration). Any change 1648  
in the reduced design post -approval should be evaluated for its impact to the product quality prior to 1649  
modifying the annual  stability protocol. While the testing intervals listed during product development 1650  
may be appropriate in the pre -approval stage, reduced testing may be appropriate after approval where 1651  

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
65 
 data are available that demonstrate adequate and consistent stability. Where data exist that indicate the 1652  
stability of a product is not compromised, the applicant is encouraged to propose and justify, where 1653  
applicable, a protocol which supports the reduction or elimination of specific testing (e.g., 9 -month 1654  
testing interval) or certain attributes (e.g., orthogonal testing) for post -approval, long -term studies.  1655  
15.3 Product Lifecycle Stability Studies  1656  
Product lifecycle stability studies are conducted under the accelerated, intermediate, or long -term 1657  
storage conditions (as applicable ) to support product lifecycle changes by assessing whether the change 1658  
has an impact on any stability related quality attributes of the commercial drug substance or product 1659  
under the labelled storage, handling and use conditions. A risk assessment should b e conducted  (refer 1660  
to Section 3 – Stability Protocol Design and Annex 1 – Reduced Stability Protocol Design ) and can be 1661  
used to justify the change and determine the need and extent of studies required to support changes after 1662  
approval in compliance with regional requirements. A post -approval change could fall into one of the 1663  
following scenarios that are based on the  nature and impact of the change, stability data requirements 1664  
and where the re-test/shelf life establishment could change :   1665  
• Scenario 1:  A stability risk assessment indicates the proposed changes will not have an impact  on 1666  
the stability profile (e.g., chan ge to a comparable analytical procedure, change in outside cap 1667  
colour ). Stability data in this case is unnecessary and the re -test period or shelf life will not be re - 1668  
established.  Maintained product stability would be confirmed as part of the Ongoing Stab ility 1669  
Programme.  1670  
• Scenario 2:  The proposed changes may potentially impact  the stability profile (e.g., manufacturing 1671  
process change, change in formulation). A stability study, a stability risk assessment, or a 1672  
combination thereof may be appropriate to suppo rt this change.  The risk assessment process may 1673  
include a well -designed study to determine whether additional formal stability studies or other 1674  
supportive stability studies are necessary. The assessment should establish whether the re -test 1675  
period/shelf li fe and storage condition may be maintained or if they should be re -established.  1676  
- If the proposed changes have a demonstrated impact that can reduce or extend the re -test 1677  
period/shelf life based on the preliminary stability results, then a re -test period/ shelf life  1678  
and storage condition may need to be re -established per recommendation s in Section 3 - 1679  
Stability Protocol Design  through Section 7 - Storage Conditions .   1680  
- If the proposed change is expected to have a low impact but formal stability studie s are 1681  
warranted based on preliminary data and risk assessment, a commitment should be made 1682  
to continue these stability studies through the re -test period/shelf life and the re -test period 1683  
or shelf life does not need to be re -established .   1684  

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
66 
 - If the proposed change is demonstrated through the risk assessment and/or a well -designed 1685  
stability study (including analytical comparability according to ICH Q5E for biological 1686  
products),  to not impact the re -test period or shelf life, then this assessment and/or data ma y 1687  
be used to justify that formal stability studies are not needed to retain the current re -test 1688  
period or shelf life (e.g., change in compendial excipient supplier).   1689  
- If a risk assessment or an initial set of stability results do not allow for an understan ding of 1690  
the impact to the re -test period/ shelf life , the re -test period/ shelf life  and storage condition 1691  
may need to be re -established based on the post -change stability data.  1692  
- Product lifecycle stability studies intended to extend the re -test period or she lf life should 1693  
align with the principles outlined for primary stability (e.g., for setting re -test period/ shelf 1694  
life). Justification should be provided when a shelf life  reduction is proposed as a post - 1695  
approval change. This justification should only be bas ed on scientific reasons.  1696  
In most circumstances, stability evaluation is generally expected in the context of the specific change 1697  
and should include assessment of impact on drug substance, intermediate and/or final drug product.  1698  
Additional scientific, risk -based considerations and approaches for identifying stability -related quality 1699  
attributes, use of appropriate tools to evaluate the i mpact of the intended change and developing 1700  
strategies for confirmatory stability studies supporting stability for post -change material are included in 1701  
ICH Q12, Chapter 9 (Stability Data Approaches to Support the Evaluation of CMC Changes ) and 1702  
recommendati ons for p ost-approval changes.  For biological s, after successful demonstration of 1703  
analytical comparability according to ICH Q5E including  the stability profile, the shelf life  of the pre - 1704  
change material can be assigned to the post -change material. If succ essful demonstration of analytical 1705  
comparability is not achieved, additional stability studies would be needed.  1706  
In some instances,  a stability protocol may include additional time points beyond a proposed shelf life  1707  
to allow shelf life  extensions in  the future (e.g. , to avert supply management issues). An extension of 1708  
the approved shelf life based on acceptable stability data from a minimum of 3 production or primary 1709  
batches may be submitted to allow a longer shelf life . 1710  
The applicant should apply  an appro priate stability strategy that demonstrates the established  re-test 1711  
period/ shelf life  and storage conditions are still accurate. In such cases, an appropriate stability strategy 1712  
may include:  1713  
• A targeted stability study that focuses on the potentially impacted stability related quality 1714  
attributes and re -test period/ shelf life  limiting attrib utes. 1715  

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
67 
 • The use of comparative accelerated/stress and/or predictive stability studies (e.g., modelling, 1716  
including extrapolation, or stability bridging study for biological product) to demonstrate the 1717  
understanding from the process/product change.  1718  
• A risk assessment demonstrating that an understanding of the impact to any stability related 1719  
quality attributes can support limited real -time data for post -change material while claiming 1720  
the same re -test period/ shelf life  as the pre -change material . 1721  
• A full evalua tion of stability related quality attributes through long -term studies. This may be 1722  
necessary when the impact of the change is not well understood or demonstrated.  1723  
Reduced protocol designs may be applied for drug products with multiple commercial presentat ions 1724  
where stability performance is generally well understood. For example, a worst -case approach may be 1725  
applied to products with multiple bottle configurations, where the configuration with the highest 1726  
moisture vapor transmission rate (MVTR)  is selected f or evaluation ( refer to Annex 1 – Reduced 1727  
Stability Protocol Design ). Reduced protocol design considerations may also apply to photostability or 1728  
in-use studies supporting changes such as primary/secondary packaging or in -use and should follow the 1729  
same cons iderations as discussed above and in Section 8 - Photostability  and Section 1 1 In-Use 1730  
Stability .  1731  
If specific tests or timepoints from the primary stability studies had been removed for the ongoing 1732  
stability protocol, these may need to be restored for the stability studies used to support a post -approval 1733  
change.  1734  
15.4 Stability Studies to Support New Dosage Forms and New Strengths/Concentrations   1735  
This section addresses the recommendations on what should be submitted regarding stability of a new 1736  
dosage form or a new strength /concentration  by the owner of the original regulatory submission .  A 1737  
new dosage form or strength/concentration  contains the same drug substance as included in the existing, 1738  
approved drug product. Within scope of a new dosage form  are new produ cts with different 1739  
administration route (e.g., oral to parenteral, intravenous to subcutaneous), new specific 1740  
functionality/delivery systems (e.g., immediate release tablet to modified release tablet, lyophili sed to 1741  
liquid product) and different dosage for ms of the same administration route (e.g., capsule to tablet, 1742  
solution to suspension, vial to prefilled syringe).  1743  
Stability protocols for new dosage forms or new strengths/concentrations  should generally follow the 1744  
guidance for primary stability studies ( refer to Table 1).  In certain  justified  cases, based on prior 1745  
knowledge and an established stability profile, a science - and risk -based, reduced stability protocol a t 1746  
submission may be acceptable  (e.g., 6 months accelerated and 6 months long term data  for a new dosage 1747  
form for a synthetic chemical entity  per Table 1 ). In cases where the existing commercial data are 1748  

ICH Q1 STABILITY STUDIES FOR DRUG SUBSTANCES AND DRUG PRODUCTS  
 
 
68 
 relevant to the shelf life of the new dosage form or the new strength/concentration , a risk assessment 1749  
with an appropriate justification and additional supporting information (e.g., predictive data, 1750  
comparative bridging data and/or prior knowledge) should be provided. In these cases, a commitment 1751  
stability study would also be expected  in accordance with the principles discussed in Section 15.1 – 1752  
Commitment Stability Studies .  1753

manufacturing process. Bulk drug products are considered drug product intermediates.   1800  
LED : Light -emitting diode  1801  
Long -term Testing: Stability studies under  the recommended long -term storage condition for the re - 1802

NMT : Not More Than  1820  
Ongoing stability studies (also referred to as annual stability studies):  Stability st udies conducted 1821  
under long -term storage conditions on an annual basis to ensure the consistency of stability related 1822  
quality attributes at the approved  storage conditions over the product lifecycle. These studies also allow 1823  
for the monitoring of the stabil ity characteristics and examine trends in the stability data to confirm the 1824  
appropriate storage conditions relevant for the product and to confirm a re -test period or a shelf life.  1825

is generally, at a minimum, one -tenth  that of a full production scale or 100 000 units, whichever is the 1831  
larger, unless otherwise ade quately justified. For biologics, the steps of upstream and downstream 1832  
processing should be identical except for the scale of production.  1833  
PQS : Pharmaceutical Quality System  1834  
Primary Batch: A batch of a drug substance or drug product used in a primary  stability study . 1835  
Primary Stability Studies: Stability studies conducted under the accelerated and long term (and, where 1836  
applicable, intermediate) storage conditions undertaken on primary stabili ty batches to establish a re - 1837  
test period or a shelf life. Where appropriate, the primary stability studies may be conducted on non - 1838  
production scale batches.  1839

the change has an impact on any stability related quality a ttributes of the commercial drug substance or 1849  
product under the labelled storage, handling and use conditions.  1850  
RH: Relative Humidity  1851  
Re-test Date: The date after which samples of the drug substance should be examined to ensure that 1852  
the material is still in compliance with the specification and thus suitable for use in the manufacture of 1853  
a given drug product.  1854  
Re-test Period: The re -test period is a period of time during which the drug substance is expected to 1855  
remain within its specification and, ther efore, can be used in manufacture of a given drug product, 1856  
provided the drug substance has been stored under the defined conditions.   After this period, a batch of 1857  
drug substance can be  re-tested for compliance with its specification and then used immediat ely for 1858  
manufacture of drug product.   A re-test period is normally applicable to synthetic drug substance s and 1859  
may be applicable to certain well -characteri sed biological drug substances.  1860  
Semi -permeable  Containers : Containers that allow the passage of solve nt or gas , while preventing 1861  
solute loss. Examples of semi - permeable containers include plastic bags and semi -rigid, low -density 1862  
polyethylene (LDPE) pouches for large volume parenteral (LVPs), and LDPE ampoules, bottles and 1863  
vials.  1864

in assay from its initial value; or failure to meet the acceptance criteria for pote ncy when using 1869  
biological or immunological procedures  (e.g., for antibiotics ); (2) Any degradation product exceeding 1870  
its acceptance criterion; (3) Failure to meet the acceptance criteria for appearance, physical attributes 1871  
and functionality test (e.g., colour, phase separation, re -suspend ability, caking, hardness, dose delivery 1872  
per actuation); however, some changes in physical attributes (e.g., softening of suppositories, melting 1873  
of creams) may be expected under accelerated conditions; and, as appropriate f or the dosage form ; (4) 1874  
Failure to meet the acceptance criterion for pH; (5) Failure to meet the specification  for dissolution 1875  
testing ; or, (6) A 5% loss in water from its initial value for products stored in semi -permeable containers.   1876

 Storage Condition T olerances:  The acceptable variations in temperature and relative humidity of 1877  
storage facilities for formal stability studies.  1878  
Stress  Studies : Studies undertaken to assess the effect of stress conditions on the d rug substance and/or 1879  
drug product which can  be divided into two categories:  1880  
1) Studies conducted under stress conditions that are more severe than the accelerated conditions , but 1881  
not necessarily  intended to deliberately degrade the sample , which may be useful in gaining product 1882  
knowledge and evaluating the effect of excursions outside the label storage conditions.  1883  
2) Studies conducted under forced degradation conditions that are intended to deliberately degrade the 1884  
sample (such as elevated temperature, humidity, pH, oxidation, agitation and li ght) and may be used to: 1885  
investigate the potential degradation pathways; gain product knowledge; understand the intrinsic 1886  
stability of drug substance; and used to develop and confirm stability -indicating nature of the analytical 1887  
procedure.  1888  
Supporting Data:  Data, other than those from formal stability studies, that support the analytical 1889  
procedures, the proposed re -test period or shelf life and the label storage statements. Such data include 1890  
(1) stability data on early synthetic route batches of drug substan ce, small scale batches of materials, 1891  
investigational formulations not proposed for marketing, related formulations and product presented in 1892  
containers and closures other than those proposed for marketing; (2) information regarding test results 1893  
on containe rs; and (3) other scientific rationales.  1894  
Supporti ve stability studies:  Ancillary stability studies that are conducted (as applicable) to support 1895  
the practical use of the product (including label claims) or a re -test period or a shelf life (e.g., 1896

Annex 1 Reduced Stability Protocol Design  
ICH Q1  Stability Studies for Drug Substances and Drug Products  
 
A1-1   
18 ANNEXES  1948  
Annex 1 Reduced Stability Protocol Design  1949  
A1-1 Introduction  1950  
This annex is intended to address recommendations on the application of reduced stability protocol designs 1951  
conducted in accordance with  principles outlined in the core guideline.   1952  
A reduced stability protocol design is one in which samples for every factor combination are not all tested 1953  
at all time points . 1954  
The reduced stability designs presented below may be proposed for any formal stability study protocol , i.e., 1955  
primary , commitment , ongoing ( annual ), product lifecycle . Implementation of some strategies requires a 1956  
strong understanding of p roduct stability performance and risks and may be more suitable for lifecycle 1957  
applications or where prior knowledge may be leveraged.  If a reduced protocol design is introduced after 1958  
the original marketing authorisation, change management procedures shoul d be followed (refer to ICH  1959  
Q10) in accordance with regional requirements.  1960  
This annex provides guidance on bracketing and matrixing study designs and other science - and risk -based 1961  
reduced stability design strategies. Specific principles are defined for situations in which reduced stability 1962  
strategies can be applied. Sample designs are provided for illustrative purposes and should not be 1963  
considered the only, or the mo st appropriate, designs in all cases.  1964  
A1-2 General Principles for Reduced Stability Designs  1965  
Any reduced design should be able to meet the objective of the study with a defined and acceptable risk as 1966  
compared to a full design.  The potential risk associated with  a reduced design should be considered (e.g., 1967  
establishing a shorter re -test period or shelf life than could be derived from a full design due to the reduced 1968  
amount of data collected).  1969  
Reduced designs can be applied to long -term stability studies for most types of drug products, although 1970  
additional justification should be provided for complex products (e.g., a drug delivery system where there 1971  
are many potential drug -device interactions, certain biological products).  For the study of drug substances, 1972  
matrix ing is usually of limited utility and bracketing is generally not applicable; however, reduced time 1973  
points and/or attribute testing could be justified where little or no degradation occurs.  Additional reduced 1974  
protocol designs are also discussed and may be  most relevant when product and stability knowledge are 1975  

Annex 1 Reduced Stability Protocol Design

A1-2   
high (e.g., to support post -approval changes; Refer to Section 15 – Stability Considerations for 1976  
Commitments and Product Lifecycle Management ). 1977  
Whether a reduced design can be applied depends on a num ber of circumstances, as discussed in detail 1978  
below. The use of any reduced design should be justified. In certain cases, the condition described in this 1979  
annex is sufficient justification for use, while in other cases, additional justification should be pro vided. 1980  
The type and level of justification in each of these cases will depend on the available supporting data and 1981  
risk assessment.  1982  
The reduced designs discussed below are based on different principles. Therefore, careful consideration 1983  
and scientific just ification should precede the use of more than one reduced design principle together in one 1984  
design.  1985  
If risks are identified during a reduced design study, a change to full testing or to a less reduced design may 1986  
be implemented with an explanation of the dri vers for the increase to the design. P roper adjustments should 1987  
be made to the statistical analysis, where applicable, to account for the increase in sample size as a result 1988  
of the change  (26-27). Once the design is changed, full testing or less reduced testing should be carried out 1989  
through the remaining time points of the stability study.  1990  
A1-3 Reduced Design Approaches  1991  
A1-3.1 Bracketing  1992  
Bracketing is design of a stability schedule such that only samples on th e extremes of certain design factors, 1993  
e.g., strength, package size, would be tested at all time points as in a full design. The design assumes that 1994  
the stability of any intermediate levels is represented by the stability of the extremes tested. Bracketing can 1995  
be applied to different container sizes or different fills in the same container closure system.  1996  
The use of a bracketing design would not be considered appropriate if it cannot be demonstrated that the 1997  
strengths or container sizes and/or fills selected for testing  are indeed the extremes.  1998  
A1-3.1.1 Design Factors  1999  
Design factors are variables (e.g., strength, container size and/or fill) to be evaluated in a study design for 2000  
their effect on product stability.  2001  
A1-3.1.1.1  Strength  2002  
Bracketing can be applied to studies wi th multiple strengths of identical or closely related formulations 2003  

Annex 1 Reduced Stability Protocol Design  
ICH Q1  Stability Studies for Drug Substances and Drug Products  
 
A1-3   
whose stability trends could be reasonably considered similar. Examples include but are not limited to (1) 2004  
capsules of  different  strengths  made  with different  fill plug sizes  from  the same  powder  blend, (2) tablets 2005  
of different strengths manufactured by compressing varying amounts of a common  blend, (3) liquid 2006  
formulation of a biological  of different concentration or fill volume,  unless there are additional 2007  
considerations for excluding  some complex biological s or live vaccines, (4) solutions and solid dosage 2008  
forms for oral use of different strengths with formulations that differ only in minor excipients (e.g., 2009  
colourants, flavourings) . 2010  
With justification and supporting data, bracketing can be applied to studies with multiple strengths where 2011  
the relative amounts of drug substance and excipients change in a formulation.  2012  
In cases where different excipients are used among strengths, bracketing generally should not be applied.  2013  
A1-3.1.1.2  Container Clos ure Sizes and/or Fills  2014  
Bracketing can be applied to studies of the same container closure system where either container size or fill 2015  
varies while the other remains constant. However, if a bracketing design is considered where both container 2016  
size and fill v ary, it should not be assumed that the largest and smallest containers represent the extremes 2017  
of all container closure system configurations. Care should be taken to select the extremes by comparing 2018  
the various characteristics of the container closure syst em that may affect product stability. Depending on 2019  
the dosage form and container closure system, the following characteristics may be considered relevant: 2020  
container wall thickness, closure geometry, surface area to volume ratio, headspace to volume ratio, water 2021  
vapour permeation rate or oxygen permeation rate per dosage unit or unit fill volume, product contact 2022  
coating, stopper or closure formulation and coating, as appropriate.  2023  
Bracketing can be applied to studies for the same container when the closure va ries. Justification could 2024  
include a discussion of the relative permeation rates of the bracketed container closure systems.  Special 2025  
consideration and justification may be required for drug products stored in semi -permeable containers (refer 2026  
to Section 7.2 .2 – Storage  Conditions  for Products Packaged in Semi -Permeable Containers).  2027  
A1-3.1.2 Design Considerations and Potential Risks  2028  
Before a bracketing design is applied, its effect on the re -test period or shelf life estimation should be 2029  
assessed.  If the stability of the extremes is shown to be different, the intermediates should be considered 2030  
no more stable than the least  stable extreme (i.e., the shelf life for the intermediates  should not  exceed that 2031  
for the least stable extreme).  2032  
If, after starting the  studies, one of the extremes is no longer expected to be marketed, the study design can 2033  

Annex 1 Reduced Stability Protocol Design  
ICH Q1  Stability Studies for Drug Substances and Drug Products  
 
A1-4   
be maintained to support the bracketed intermediates.  2034  
A1-3.1.3 Design Example  2035  
An example of a bracketing design is given in Table A1- 1. This example is based on a product available 2036  
in three strengths and three container sizes.  In this example, the 15 mL and 500 mL container sizes represent 2037  
the extremes. The batches for each selected combination should be tested at each time point as in a full 2038  
design.  Note that the example below could represent multiple product types (synthetics and biologicals).  2039

Key:  T = Sample  tested  2041  
A1-3.2 Matrixing  2042  
Matrixing is the design of a stability schedule such that a selected subset of the total number of possible 2043  
samples for all factor combinations would be tested at a specified time point. At a subsequent time point, 2044  
another subset of samples for all factor combinations is tested. The design assumes that the stability of each 2045  
subset of samples tested represents the stability of all samples at a given timepoint. The diff erences in the 2046  
samples for the same drug product should be identified, for example, covering different batches, different 2047  
strengths, different sizes of the same container closure system and different container closure systems.  2048  
When a secondary packaging sy stem contributes to the stability of the drug product, matrixing can be 2049  
performed across the container closure systems (e.g., inclusion of a foil overwrap).  2050  
Each storage condition should be treated separately under its own matrixing design. Matrixing shoul d not 2051  
be performed across test attributes. However, alternative matrixing designs for different test attributes can 2052  
be applied if justified.  2053  
A1-3.2.1 Design Factors  2054  
Matrixing designs can be applied to strengths with identical or closely related formulations. Exampl es 2055  
include but are not limited to (1) capsules of different strengths made with different fill plug sizes from the 2056  
same powder blend, (2) tablets of different strengths manufactured by compressing varying amounts of the 2057  

Annex 1 Reduced Stability Protocol Design  
ICH Q1  Stability Studies for Drug Substances and Drug Products  
 
A1-5   
same granulation and (3) oral soluti ons of different strengths with formulations that  differ only in minor 2058  
excipients (e.g., colourants or flavourings), (4) biological  of different concentration and fill volume, (5) 2059  
biological s of different concentration with different size container or pre -filled syringe  size, (6) relative 2060  
amounts of excipients (e.g., minor variation to the concentration of the filler) . Justification should generally 2061  
be based on supporting data. For example, to matrix across two different closures or contain er closure 2062  
systems, supporting data could be supplied showing relative moisture vapour  transmission rates or similar 2063  
protection against light. Alternatively, supporting data could be supplied to show that the drug product is 2064  
not affected by oxygen, moistur e, or light.  2065  
Other factors for matrixing may be considered if justified , e.g., batches made by  using the same process 2066  
and equipment and container sizes and/or fills in the same container closure system.  2067  
A1-3.2.2 Design Considerations  2068  
A matrixing design should be b alanced as far as possible so that each combination of factors is tested to the 2069  
same extent over the intended duration of the study and through the last time point prior to submission. 2070  
However, due to the recommended full testing at certain time points, as  discussed below, it may be difficult 2071  
to achieve a complete balance in a design where time points are matrixed.  2072  
In a design where time points are matrixed, all selected factor combinations should be tested at the initial 2073  
and final time points, while only certain fractions of the designated combinations should be tested at each 2074  
intermediate time point. In addition, unless justified, data from at least three time points, including initial, 2075  
should be available for each selected combination through the fi rst 12 months of the study.  2076  
For matrixing at an accelerated storage condition, care should be taken to ensure testing occurs at a 2077  
minimum of three time points, including initial and final, for each selected combination of factors. Thus, 2078  
matrixing for accel erated studies may have limited application.  2079  
When a matrix on design factors is applied, if one strength or container size and/or fill is no longer intended 2080  
for marketing, stability testing of that strength or  container size and/or fill can be continued t o support the 2081  
other strengths or  container sizes and/or fills in the design.  Stability commitments in accordance with  2082  
Section 15 – (Stability Considerations for Commitments and Product Lifecycle Management ) should reflect 2083  
the proposed commercial presentations.  2084  
A1-3.2.3 Design Examples  2085  
Examples of matrixing designs on time points for a product in two strengths ( 50 mg  and 75 mg) are shown 2086  
in Tables A1-2 and A1-3.  The terms one -half reduction and one -third reduction r efer to the reduction 2087

strategy initially applied to the full study design  for timepoints excluding initial, 12 -months  and final . For 2088  
example, a one -half reduction initially eliminates one in every two time points from the full study design 2089  
and a one -third reduction initially removes one in every three. In the examples shown in Tables 2 and 3 , 2090  
the reductions are less than one -half and one -third due to  the inclusion  of full testing  of all factor  2091  
combinations  at some  time points.  2092

A1-3.2.4 Applicability and Degree of Reduction  2112  
The following,  although  not an exhaustive  list, should  be considered  when  a matrixing design is 2113  
contemplated:  2114  
• knowledge  of data variability  2115  
• expected  stability  of the product  2116  
• availability  of supporting  data, including enhanced stability knowledge if available  2117  
• stability differences in the product within a factor or among factors  2118  

Annex 1 Reduced Stability Protocol Design  
ICH Q1  Stability Studies for Drug Substances and Drug Products  
 
A1-8   
• number of factor combinations in the study and/or  2119  
• stability risk assessment, if performed.  2120  
Data variability and product stability, as shown by supporting data, should be considered when a matrixing 2121  
design is applied. If the supportive data show large variability, a matrixing design should not be applied.  2122  
If a matrixing design is considered applic able, the degree of reduction that can be made from a full design 2123  
depends on the number of factor combinations being evaluated. The more factors associated with a product 2124  
and the more levels in each factor, the larger the degree of reduction that can be co nsidered. However, any 2125  
reduced design should have the ability to adequately predict the product shelf life.  2126  
A1-3.2.5 Potential Risk  2127  
Due to the reduced amount of data collected, a matrixing design on factors other than time points generally 2128  
has less precision in shelf life estimation and yields a shorter shelf life than the corresponding full design. 2129  
In addition, such a matrixing design may have insufficient power to detect certain main or interaction 2130  
effects,  thus leading to incorrect pooling of data  from different design factors during shelf  life estimation. 2131  
If there is an excessive reduction in the number of factor combinations tested and data from the tested factor 2132  
combinations cannot be pooled  to establish a single shelf life, it may be impossible  to estimate the shelf 2133  
lives for the missing factor combinations.  The risk may be mitigated through use of supportive stability 2134  
data.   2135  
A study design that matrixes on time points only may be used to detect differences in rates of change among 2136  
factors and  to establish a reliable shelf life. This strategy assumes linearity and full testing of all other factor 2137  
combinations at both the initial and final time points.  2138  
A1-3.3 Knowledge and Risk Based Protocol Reductions  2139  
Additional reduced stability protocol designs tha t are different from bracketing and matrixing approaches 2140  
may also be applied. Product knowledge and risk -based assessments are used to justify these stability 2141  
strategies.  If the knowledge - and risk -based reduced protocol is used to support a post -approval  change, 2142  
the risk assessment should also consider the potential impact of the change on the stability performance of 2143  
the product. As discussed in ICH Q12, Chapter 9, there are numerous methods to assess the impact of a 2144  
change in addition to long -term stabi lity studies.  2145  
A1-3.3.1 Design Factors  2146  
Where justified, a reduction may be applied to attributes, timepoints, samples and/or storage conditions.  2147  

Annex 1 Reduced Stability Protocol Design  
ICH Q1  Stability Studies for Drug Substances and Drug Products  
 
A1-9   
To apply these strategies, the applicant should present an understanding of what attributes are subject to 2148  
change over the re -test period/shelf life and what conditions might impact their rate of change.  This should 2149  
be supported by data and/or product kno wledge and used to conduct a risk assessment that justifies the 2150  
proposed reductions.   2151  
A1-3.3.2 Design Considerations and Potential Risks  2152  
Stability risk assessment tools should be developed throughout the product lifecycle in accordance with 2153  
ICH Q9.  The stability understanding used to assess risk may come from multiple sources, including stress 2154  
testing, accelerated testing, formal stability studies and prior knowledge from product development, e.g. , 2155  
on leachables and container closure integrity . 2156  
Quality attributes that are considered low risk for stability testing are those that are unlikely to change on 2157  
stability and are not critical to safety and efficacy of the product.  An example of this is residual solvent 2158  
content in a crystalline synthetic drug substance, sin ce residual solvent content is assessed at release and 2159  
will not increase over time and does not have the potential to impact other CQAs.  With appropriate 2160  
justification, these attributes may be removed from the stability protocol.  2161  
Certain quality attribute s may be removed when the attribute has the potential to change but has been 2162  
demonstrated not to change over time or is monitored via other quality attributes and the change is 2163  
established to not have a meaningful impact on quality, safety and efficacy thr ough the re -test period or 2164  
shelf life. However, to support a future change the impact on the stability of these quality attributes should 2165  
be assessed and if necessary, reintroduced.  2166  
A1-3.3.3  Design Strategies and Examples  2167  
Descriptions of protocol reduction strateg ies and examples of instances where a reduced protocol approach 2168  
may be applied with justification are provided below. These strategies may be applied to other situations as 2169  
well when justified.  2170  
Reductions from the Primary Stability Protocol for Stability C ommitments : Based on overall product 2171  
knowledge, development data and/or results of the ongoing or completed primary stability study, the 2172  
applicant may propose to remove attributes, storage conditions and/or timepoints f or new protocols.  This 2173  
may be justif ied if the applicant:  2174  
• Demonstrates that the attribute is unchanging on stability, not clinically meaningful, not relevant 2175  
to the assessment of re -test period or shelf life and not required for monitoring of the quality, safety 2176  
and efficacy of the drug product after release and during its expected lifecycle . 2177  

Annex 1 Reduced Stability Protocol Design  
ICH Q1  Stability Studies for Drug Substances and Drug Products  
 
A1-10   
• Demonstrates how different storage conditions may impact stability and the worst -case storage 2178  
conditions relevant to the drug substance or drug product are selected for evaluation.  2179  
• Demonstrates that  specific timepoints are not meaningful for assessment of trends.  2180  
Example 1  – Reduction from Primary Stability Study to the Commitment Study that Confirm s Shelf Life for 2181  
Synthetic Solid Oral Tablet.  2182  
Justification for the reduction from the primary protocol to the commitment protocol to confirm the shelf 2183  
life ( refer to Section 15 Stability Considerations for Commitments and Product Lifecycle Management ) 2184  
below may include historical data and accumulated knowledge supporting:  2185  
• lack of change to water a ctivity and microbiological attributes,  2186  
• demonstration that trends are not significant justifying removal of the 9 - and 18 -month timepoints  2187  
• knowledge the product is stable when stored at 30 ºC/75 % RH and that this data may be used to 2188  
represent storage at less strenuous room temperature conditions   2189

A1-11   
Targeted Stability Designs:    2198  
Worst -Case Analysis Strategies :  When stability characteristics for a product are well understood and a 2199  
worst -case presentation is predictable, the applicant may design a stability strategy that evaluates the worst - 2200  
case presentation with the conclusion that other presentations will demo nstrate equivalent or better stability 2201  
performance.  2202  
Example  2 - Different Drug Product Concentrations .  If it is well -understood and predictable how the 2203  
relative amounts of drug substance and excipients impact the stability profile for multiple concentrati ons, 2204  
a worst -case approach could be proposed to support a reduction to samples. This approach may be justified 2205  
where the concentration that provides the worst -case effect on stability is assessed. It is inferred based on 2206  
product knowledge that if suitable stability is demonstrated for the worst -case concentration, the stability 2207  
for other concentrations would be similar or improved.  2208  
Example 3 - Multiple Container Closure System Configurations and/or Fill Volume . If the characteristics 2209  
of the product in diffe rent container sizes and/or with different fills are well understood and their impact on 2210  
stability related quality attributes are predictable, then a worst -case approach could be proposed to support 2211  
a reduction to samples. In this example, the configuratio n that presents the ‘worst -case’ for product stability 2212  
is selected for the stability study. It is inferred based on product knowledge that if suitable stability is 2213  
demonstrated for the worst -case configuration, the stability for other configurations would be similar or 2214  
improved.  2215  
A1-4  Data Evaluation for Reduced Study Designs  2216  
The statistical procedures described in Section 13 - Data Evaluation  can be applied to the analysis of 2217  
stability data obtained from any reduced study design.  2218  
If a bracketing design is utilised, there is an assumption that the stability of the intermediate strengths or 2219  
sizes/fills is represented by the stability at the extremes. If the statistical analysis indicates that the stability 2220  
of the extreme strengths or sizes/fills is different, the  intermediate strengths or sizes/fills should be 2221  
considered no more stable than the least stable extreme. The statistical procedures suitable for multi -factor, 2222  
full design study can be applied to the analysis of stability data obtained from a matrixing des ign study. 2223  
The statistical analysis should clearly identify the procedure and assumptions used. The use of a matrixing 2224  
design can result in an estimated shelf life shorter than that resulting from a full design.  2225  
Where bracketing and matrixing are combined  in one design or when an alternative reduced protocol is 2226  
utilised , the same statistical principles may be applied.  2227

Annex 2 Stability Modelling  2228  
General information on selection of batches and minimum stability data at the time of submission and steps 2229  
towards a comprehensive evaluation of available stability data are presented in Section 3 - Stability Protocol 2230  
Design , Table 1 and Section 13  - Data Evaluation , respectively. When limited real -time data are available, 2231  
Section 13.1 - General Considerations  may be referenced for general considerations related to establishing  2232  
an initial re -test or shelf life of drug substance or drug product using the decision tree for synthetics. While 2233  
shelf life for biologic al products is generally established based on long -term stability data, enhanced 2234  
stability mode lling approaches could be considered for biological drug substances and drug products using 2235  
the principles in sectio n 2 of this Annex or using  extrapolation principles (refer to  Section 13. 2.9- 2236  
Extrapolation of Biologicals ) for certain well -characteri sed biological drug substances with a well 2237  
understood  stability profile. This Annex provides additional and specific reco mmendations on statistical 2238  
tools and models to support the use of extrapolation and enhanced stability model ling approaches.  2239  
This Annex is structured in two parts, the first provides examples for the statistical tools and models 2240  
commonly used to assess th e data variability between batches for single factor and multi -factor, full design 2241  
studies to establish re -test period or shelf life.  The second part describes enhanced stability models for 2242  
well-characterised molecules that may be based on empirical fit o f stability data to kinetic functions or 2243  
incorporating prior knowledge into data evaluation.  2244  
As a general principle, the least complex statistical model that best describes the data is recommended to 2245  
be used. Depending on the model and its context of use, the core study design elements that should be a 2246  
part of any prospective stability modelling strategy include (1) defining the purpose of the model, (2) a 2247  
description of the model, type of mode lling (e.g ., mechanistic or empirical) and its components, inclu ding 2248  
specifying what is being estimated, tested for, or predicted, (3) identification of variables and appropriate 2249  
statistical tools to achieve the stated study objectives, (4) sample size planning, (5) model development and 2250  
fitting, including justificatio n of the appropriateness of the input data (6) description, relevance and 2251  
justification for use of product -specific prior knowledge  and sources of  prior knowledge , (7) model 2252  
evaluation, including output data, limitations and assessing model robustness, (8) the quantitation and 2253  
impact of uncertainty in any estimates or predictions providing adequate statistical assurance of any 2254  
conclusions drawn (e.g ., confidence, to lerance or prediction intervals) (9) model validation and verification 2255  
with real -time data  (10) plans for ongoing model monitoring and lifecycle considerations, as needed and 2256  
(11) the risk management strategy if differences are observed between the predic ted shelf  life and actual 2257  
shelf  life based on confirmatory data.  Consequently, its usage can be expected to be constrained by the 2258  
modelling method, input or output data, conditions evaluated, etc., and should not be applied to conditions 2259

outside the model’ s validated range, including different molecules, without a mechanistic understanding or 2260  
robust scientific justification based on relevant prior knowledge. Refer to ICH Q8 -10 Points to Consider 2261  
for additional general principles related to model development , validation and verification. Models should 2262  
be managed through a pharmaceutical quality system (PQS) after successful validation and verification.  2263  
A2-1 Statistical Evaluation of Stability Data from Single or Multi -factor Study Designs  2264  
In this section of the An nex, data evaluation is discussed for (A) single factor and (B) multi -factor, full - 2265  
design studies; where a single factor could be the batches used for a single product and multi -factors 2266  
includes different fill volumes, concentrations, container dimensions etc, to set re -test period or shelf life 2267  
when the stability protocol is not reduced by bracketing or matrixing  (21). When data from non -primary 2268  
batches are used, the representativeness of the process, container closure system and analytical procedure  2269  
shoul d be justified, including the impact of any differences, in the context of the modelling strategy being 2270  
proposed. Data from primary stability batches need to meet criteria outlined in Section 3 – Stability Protocol 2271  
Design and elsewhere in this guideline. U seful references for the statistical approaches demonstrated in this 2272  
guideline can be found in Section 17 – References (19, 25-27). Data evaluation for reduced study designs 2273  
is described in Annex 1 (Reduced Stability Protocol Design)  and Section 13 (Data E valuation ). 2274  
A2-1.1 Evaluation  of Variability for Stability Data in Single -factor, Full Design Studies 2275  
Using Linear Regression M odels  2276  
In general, the mathematical relationship between certain drug substance or drug product quantitative 2277  
quality attributes and time is inferred to be linear  as a reasonable approximation in a range of interest .  The 2278  
guideline ( refer to Section 13 – Data Evaluation ) describes how, for chemical synthetic entities, the 2279  
available long -term stability data may be extrapol ated to establish a shelf life using a decision tree approach.  2280  
Each primary, production and representative development batch in a formal stability protocol, stored under 2281  
the long -term conditions, may be evaluated separately and the worst -case batch used t o establish the re -test 2282  
period or shelf life. Combining multiple batches is discussed in Annex 2, Section A2-1.2 - Linear Models 2283  
Used to Assess Stability Profile  and Section 13.2.2 - Combining Batches.    2284  
Figure : A2- 1 shows the single batch  (single -factor) regression line for assay of a synthetic chemical drug 2285  
product with upper and lower acceptance criteria of 105 percent and 95 percent of label claim f or assay, 2286  
respectively.  From 12 months of long -term data, a shelf life of 24 months can be proposed by extrapolation 2287  
if no significant trends in accelerated and/or intermediate stability data. In this example, two -sided 95 2288  
percent confidence limits for th e mean are calculated. The lower confidence limit intersects the lower 2289  
acceptance criterion at 30 months, while the upper confidence limit does not intersect with the upper 2290  
acceptance criterion until later. Therefore, the proposed shelf life of 24 months c an be supported by the 2291

statistical analysis of the assay. A similar approach may be used for an attribute, such as an impurity, that 2292  
increases over time and has a one -sided upper 95% confidence limit intersecting the attribute specification 2293  
and support the  target shelf life ( : Shelf Life Estimation with Upper and Lower Acceptance Criteria  2294  
 2295  
Figure : A2- 2). When the above approach is used, the mean value of the quantitative attribute (e.g., assay, 2296  
degradation products) can be expected to remain within the acceptance criteria through the end of  the re - 2297  
test period or shelf life at a confidence level of 95 percent.  2298

A2-1.2 Linear  Models to Assess Stability Profile  Using Multiple Batches  2304  
When stability data for more than a single batch are available, the data evaluation may use a linear model   2305  
to evaluate the attribute stability profile at stated storage conditions and either establish or support a re-test 2306  
period or shelf life.  A linear model (Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), fixed effects or mixed effects 2307  
model) may be applied to stability data, in which, the aim is to generate confidence bounds (or tolerance 2308  
intervals for mixed effect models) and establish the maximum re -test period or shelf life that may be 2309  
claimed. The accuracy and precision of the analysis is determined by the number of batches suitable for the 2310  
analysis , confidence in the uniformity of data, and the number of data points within each time -course study. 2311  
Applicants are a dvised that there is inherent risk of inaccurate representation of the stability profiles of 2312  
manufactured batches dependent on the number of batches used and that batch numbers should be a 2313  
consideration for study design.  The minimum data set is discussed in the guideline ( refer to Section 3 – 2314  
Stability Protocol Design).  A confidence interval based approach may be applied to evaluate shelf life when 2315  
long-term data through shelf life are available  (20). 2316  
Two model types are outlined below for the linear regre ssion evaluation of stability data to establish re -test 2317  
period or shelf life, fixed effects and mixed effects models. The models transform according to whether the 2318  
batches are considered as a fixed ( refer to Annex 2 -Stability Modelling , Section 1.2.1 – Fixed Effects 2319  
Model)  or random variable ( refer to Annex 2, Section 1. 2.2 – Mixed Effects Model)  and whether the 2320  
variables are fixed or random. The choice of model generally depends on the number of batches used for 2321  
the evaluation.   2322  
A2-1.2-1 Fixed Effects Model  2323  
A Fixed Effects Model may be chosen when limited batches are available , e.g., three primary stabili ty 2324  
batches .  The ANCOVA Fixed Effects Model expresses the attribute value at each timepoint and each batch 2325  
as a function of the average y -intercept and average slope with their respective variability across the batches. 2326  
The level of significance for simila rity between batches for intercept and slope should be proportionate to 2327  
the number of batches used in the analysis , where a higher number of batches leads to lower significance 2328  
level .  When only 3 batches are available representative of the production batc hes, the model may consider 2329  
batch as a fixed effect  rather than as a random variable, with a selected significance level  (p-value) for 2330  
intercept and slope of 0.25. From regression lines, 95% confidence bounds for attributes may be one -sided 2331  
or two -sided, d epending on their acceptance criteria  and if the attribute is known to be increasing or 2332  
decreasing , e.g., a purity attribute typically has a one -sided acceptance criterion, whereas potency, for a 2333  
biological drug substance or drug product, typically has two -sided acceptance criteria.  Increasing the 2334  
significance level for one -sided confidence intervals may be appropriate.  2335  

Annex 2 Stability Modelling  
ICH Q1 Stability Studies for Drug Substances and Drug Products  
 
A2-6 
  
The possible models after sequentially evaluating the significance of slope variability and intercept 2336  
variability between batches are indi cated in Figure 3. There is no option for Different Slopes, Common 2337  
Intercept because it is not realistic from a practical perspective to have all batches start from the same initial 2338  
value at time (t)=0, but then have different slopes.  When there is a dist ribution for the attribute at release 2339  
(time zero), owing to lot -to-lot and assay variability, the model allows for different intercepts between 2340  
batches.  2341  
Scenario A: When the statistical analysis demonstrated no statistically significant differences among s lopes 2342  
and no statistically significant differences among y -intercepts (p -values > 0.25), the batch term is dropped 2343  
from the model and a common slope/common intercept model is fit to the data, which can be recogni sed as 2344  
a simple linear regression model supp orting, in this example, a 24 months shelf  life based on the confidence 2345  
bound crossing the shelf life specification acceptance limit at or after the proposed shelf life.    2346  
Scenario B: For attributes where the differences between the slopes were not statis tically significant (p - 2347  
value > 0.25), but differences between the y -intercepts were statistically significant (p -value < 0.25), the 2348  
common slope/different intercepts model was used as the final model. The worst -case batch was identified 2349  
as described in Fig ure 3 (batch #3). The shelf life is met if the worst -case batch’s confidence bound crosses 2350  
the shelf life  specification acceptance limit at or after the proposed shelf life (e.g., after 18 months).   2351  
Scenario C: For attributes where the differences between  slopes were statistically significant (p -value 2352  
<0.25), the different slopes/different intercepts model was used as the final model.  The worst -case batch is 2353  
the one whose confidence bound yields the earliest intersection with s helf life specification  acceptance limit 2354  
(batch #1). The shelf life is claimed if the worst -case batch’s 95% confidence bound crosses the s helf life 2355  
specification  acceptance limit at or after the proposed shelf life (e.g., after 24 months).  2356

A2-7 
  
Figure A2 - 3: Potential Final Models After Evaluating Slope and Intercept  2357  
 2358  
The final models per attribute may then be used to predict the mean attribute values and the 95% confidence 2359  
bound(s), to establish the re -test period or shelf life as no more than the point  of intersection of the 2360  
appropriate upper or lower confidence bound with the attribute specification.  2361  
Mixed Effects  Model  2362  
A mixed effects model may be chosen when five or more batches are available for statistical evaluation so 2363  
that batch can be treated  as a random variable.  Batches , in addition to those defined as the primary stability 2364  
batches , would be deemed as sufficiently representative of the primary batches and future production 2365  
batches through analytical comparability  with differences concluded to  not impact the stability profile of 2366  
the drug substance or drug product.  A mixed effect s model is recommended when there is risk to batch 2367  
uniformity (i.e. , greater risk of batch to batch variability). If the variance components for the random slope 2368  
and int ercept terms are estimated to be or close to zero (0), applying the fixed effect model can be more 2369  
appropriate.  2370  
The mixed effects model reflects the expectation of random variation among the batches in terms of initial 2371  
levels and trends over time (i.e., in tercepts and slopes for a linear model), and hence the true shelf life is 2372  
unique to each batch. The larger number of batches provides greater assurance that the inferred stability 2373  
profile is representative of future batches manufactured using the same proc ess.   A tolerance interval -based 2374  
approach using the linear mixed effects model may be applied to determine an extended shelf life beyond 2375  
the period covered by long -term data. For instance, the shelf life of the product is determined as the (latest) 2376  
timepo int where the (95%) the lower confidence limit of the 5th percentile (or the lower limit of the 2377  
95%/90% tolerance interval – first percentage refers to population covered, second confidence level) of the 2378

CQA is above acceptance limits. Corresponding tolera nce interval -based approaches may be used to 2379  
extrapolate an extended shelf life beyond the period covered by long -term data from the linear mixed effects 2380  
model.    2381  
A2-2 Enhanced Stability Modelling  2382  
This section  provides scientific and regulatory considerations for enhanced stability model development, 2383  
qualification and maintenance over product lifecycle for the purpose of supporting a re -test period or shelf 2384  
life. Guidance is provided for stability models that m ay be applied to well -understood drug substances or 2385  
drug products that have been extensively  characterised,  including the identification of their relevant 2386  
degradation pathways.  When enhanced stability modelling is used, applicants are encouraged to consult  2387  
with regulatory authorities to understand submission expectations.  2388  
Focus is placed on the design and data evaluation of enhanced stability models that can evaluate and 2389  
extrapolate linear and non -linear quality attribute changes over time and includes the use of prior 2390  
knowledge. Linear regression for the extrapolation of stability data and the use of stability data from 2391  
different batches are discussed in the core guideline (refer to Section 13 – Data Evaluation)  and Section 1 2392  
of this Annex  (refer to Section  A2-1 Statistical Evaluation of Stability Data from Single or Multi -factor 2393  
Study Designs ). 2394  
A2-2.1 General Principles of Enhanced Stability Modelling    2395  
The principles described in the ICH Points to Consider guide to implement ICH Q8/Q9/Q10, apply to 2396  
stability mode ls that are used to extrapolate re -test period or shelf life. These concepts are expanded in the 2397  
subsequent sections of this annex. A stability model used to set commercial re -test period or shelf life would 2398  
be considered a High -Impact Model in accordance with the elements for consideration in model validation, 2399  
verification and documentation and would be of higher risk, than, for example models used during 2400  
development studies.  2401  
There are many types of stability models available or currently under development  and, correspondingly, 2402  
the tools to evaluate data from such stability models. This annex covers general principles of currently 2403  
known kinetic, thermo -kinetic and mechanistic models as well as in silico  or de novo  computational 2404  
methods that simulate known a ttribute stability profiles. This annex does not attempt to be comprehensive 2405  
in describing all possible stability models or means of model data evaluation that could be considered 2406  
acceptable when justified. Stability models may be empirical in nature by fi tting the available stability data 2407  
and known variables to derived mathematical relationships that describe how the quality attribute stability 2408  

Annex 2 Stability Modelling

A2-9 
  
profile changes over time and measured under defined conditions. While enhanced stability models may be 2409  
used to p redict the stability profile at submission, these models should be considered as part of a 2410  
comprehensive stability program and are not intended to replace long -term stability studies.  2411  
An enhanced level of understanding for a drug substance or drug product under development (ICH Q8), 2412  
which may encompass prior knowledge from drug substance or drug product development studies and 2413  
information from structurally and functionally related molecules, referred to as “analogous molecules”, 2414  
enables the use of stability  models. See Section s 2 (Development Studies under Stress and Forced 2415  
Conditions) and 3  (Stability Protocol Design)  for considerations for prior knowledge.  The sum of 2416  
knowledge of the available stability data including confirmatory data, could support a qu antitative 2417  
prediction model.  2418  
There are many situations when a stability model may be applicable, including: setting the re -test period or 2419  
shelf life and assessing the impact of storage condition excursions or manufacturing changes. A stability 2420  
model may be applied during drug substanc e or drug product development, for an initial regulatory 2421  
submission  or as a post -approval, lifecycle management activity.  The purpose of the model and the specific 2422  
context of its use should be clearly stated.  2423  
A2-2.2 Model Development   2424  
A2-2.2.1 Choice of Model Type  2425  
Certain types of stability model are built using data obtained at elevated conditions of temperature and/or 2426  
humidity.   The experimental accelerated conditions may be a selected set of defined parameters that may 2427  
or may not overlap with the formal accelera ted and stressed storage conditions as described in Section 7 - 2428  
Storage Conditions.  2429  
Depending on the underlying principles of the proposed stability modelling methodologies, the product 2430  
type under consideration and the specific purpose of the model, certai n model types may be more 2431  
appropriate than others.  The choice of model could depend on:  2432  
• the intended context of use for the model,  2433  
• fit of stability data at the recommended storage condition to a kinetic formula,   2434  
• thermo -kinetic reactions with the fit of Arrhenius equation or its derivatives to stability data at 2435  
accelerated temperatures,   2436  
• the access to relevant prior knowledge,   2437  
• the nature of the shelf life limiting attributes, their criticality ranking, impact on the stability profile  2438  

Annex 2 Stability Modelling  
ICH Q1 Stability Studies for Drug Substances and Drug Products  
 
A2-10 
  
•  and known correla tions with structure or function of the molecule.  2439  
The appropriateness of the selected model for its intended use should be briefly described and justified in 2440  
the specific context of its proposed use. The model should be described in sufficient detail to un derstand 2441  
how it was developed and how the model is used to provide accurate prediction or inference of a quality 2442  
attribute stability profile.  2443  
A biological drug substance or drug product may be less amenable to modelling by the humidity modified 2444  
Arrhenius e quation using accelerated condition data, whereas the temperature/humidity -dependent kinetics 2445  
for a solid synthetic chemical drug substance or drug product may obey the humidity modified Arrhenius 2446  
equation for the shelf life limiting attributes.  In additi on, a model, on a case -by-case basis, may not be 2447  
appropriate for physical attribute changes.    2448  
Enhanced stability models can fall under two broad classes: (1) those that utilise only the product -specific 2449  
representative batch stability data (long -term and/ or accelerated) and (2) those that additionally utilise prior 2450  
knowledge from analogous -molecules combined with the product -specific information.   Prior knowledge 2451  
may be incorporated into the stability model evaluation in different ways, for example, to es tablish an 2452  
acceptable range for the attribute stability profile, or by using Bayesian statistics.   2453  
It is recognised that novel model types are likely to emerge in the future (e.g., use of Artificial Intelligence 2454  
Machine Learning, AI -ML). The principles ou tlined in this Annex should be generally applicable when 2455  
developing a novel stability model , though other considerations regarding data requirements may also 2456  
apply . Early engagement with regulators is recommended in such instances.  2457  
2.2.1 Selection of Critical Qu ality Attributes for Stability Modelling  2458  
Those attributes selected for modelling  should be chosen according to the purpose of the model and the 2459  
available stability knowledge.  Those attributes not selected for modelling should be justified.  The selection 2460  
of CQAs for modelling follows the same principles described in the core guideline for protocol design and 2461  
adapted to the purpose of stability model development.  The selection of stability -indicating CQAs used in 2462  
models, from those that define the stability profile (refer to Section 3 – Stability Protocol Design) should 2463  
be justified and the impact of an attribute (not part of the model) changing unexpectedly should be 2464  
considered  as part of risk management (see Annex 2 -Stability Modelling , Section 2.5 -Risk Management 2465  
and Model Lifecycle Considerations ). 2466  
To establish a re -test period or shelf life, the CQAs that have been identified as those most likely to impact 2467  
the product shelf life, would be selected for stability modelling, that is, those attributes that are considered 2468  

Annex 2 Stability Modelling  
ICH Q1 Stability Studies for Drug Substances and Drug Products  
 
A2-11 
  
to most likely approach the upper or lower bounds in the attribute specification over the storage period 2469  
(ICH Q6A and 6B) and are ‘shelf life limiting’. The sele cted quality attributes should be justified and be 2470  
the focus for developing a stability model.   2471  
A2-2.2.2 Selection of Data and Parameters to Construct a Stability Model  2472  
The data used to build a stability model are typically based on results from the long -term prim ary and 2473  
production stability batches or at accelerated conditions (e.g., elevated temperature and/or humidity).  They 2474  
may also incorporate data from earlier development studies when there is sufficient understanding of 2475  
comparability between the development  and production molecules.  2476  
When limited data from the formal stability protocol are available, one may consider leveraging prior 2477  
knowledge into the evaluation and model building . Prior knowledge from non -product analogous molecules 2478  
may supplement the product -specific stability data. Models being developed using information from other, 2479  
related products require access to sufficient prior knowledge that can be justified as transferabl e to the drug 2480  
substance or drug product. The prior knowledge molecules that are grouped as a family or class may be 2481  
justified through an evaluation of relevant characteristics for the differences between the prior knowledge 2482  
molecule(s) and the drug substan ce or drug product. These characteristics may include structural modality, 2483  
stability influencing attributes, manufacturing processes, formulation, container closure, storage conditions, 2484  
analytical procedures  and the available stability data , including degr adation profile . Prior knowledge may 2485  
be used together with primary and production batch data to generate a stability model. Any prior knowledge 2486  
data from the molecule or analogous molecules should be described and structure -function differences 2487  
justified, in terms of impact on a stability profile. In addition, similar analytical procedures should be used 2488  
for the attributes so that the data can be appropriately transferred for inclusion in generating the stability 2489  
model.  2490  
When prior knowledge from analogous m olecules is used in a stability model, it is important to identify 2491  
and address any potential for bias that could result in over -fitting or under -fitting of the model, thereby 2492  
reducing model accuracy.  The management of bias in the model from the datasets u sed should be described.  2493  
The parameters (e.g. , reaction rate, order of reaction) used to build a stability model should be chosen to 2494  
maximise the accuracy of the inferred stability profile, while avoiding over -fitting. When prior knowledge 2495  
is available, mo del accuracy may be assessed by using a relevant dataset that is not included in the model 2496  
design for which the stability profile is known . The development of a stability model may run through 2497  
several iterations while optimising the parameters to achieve a  final, simplest  model that provides the best 2498  
prediction accuracy (least difference between the predicted value and actual experimental value).  2499

A2-2.3 Evaluation of Data for Stability Modelling  2500  
The statistical approach and associated statistical parameters used should be clearly described and justified.  2501  
Stability models define the trends of quality attributes that change over time, based on experimental data 2502  
that may be linear or non -linear. The statistical approaches for molecule -specific stability data ev aluated 2503  
using linear regression and for the combining of batches for drug substance or drug product are outlined in 2504  
Section 13 - Data Evaluation  of the core guideline  and Section 1 of this Annex .  The following sections in 2505  
this Annex provide additional opt ions when using the enhanced stability models for the purpose of 2506  
extrapolating the stability profile past the available data at the recommended storage conditions. The data 2507  
distribution over time is typically characterised using justified statistical inter vals to ensure that a defined 2508  
proportion of the data lies within or that future data will lie within the interval, as appropriate for the model  2509  
and statistical interval chosen .   2510  
Most current enhanced stability models start with an empirical approach with the experimental stability 2511  
data being compared to a mathematical or kinetic function of time . When an empirical model is used and 2512  
the available stability data are being compared to the model, a demonstration of goodness of fit should be 2513  
performed using app ropriate statistical tools to avoid overfitting the kinetic function to the data when the 2514  
model incorporates the variability and thereby reducing the accuracy of prediction.   2515  
It is important that the accuracy of the model to infer or predict the stability  profile, past the last time point 2516  
of the available data, is demonstrated using appropriate statistical tools  (19-27). For example, by applying 2517  
the model to a known, full stability data set, for which the last timepoint result(s) has not been included, the  2518  
value for that last timepoint s may be predicted . The predicted value can then be compared to the known, 2519  
experimentally derived value as a measure of accuracy.  For quality attributes with high variability, other 2520  
statistical methods of model validation sho uld be considered because demonstration of the model’s 2521  
accuracy for any single timepoint may not be sufficient.  2522  
Prior knowledge data may be evaluated using Bayesian statistics as an alternative to conventional 2523  
Frequentist statistics and can allow for pred iction of drug substance or drug product stability data over time, 2524  
past the point of available long -term condition data . The Bayesian method derives a posterior distribution 2525  
for the parameters of interest by combining the likelihood distributions for the o bserved data with the prior 2526  
knowledge. The method for derivation of the prior distribution should be justified by the applicant .  The 2527  
general principles outlined in this Annex for a stability model would apply to models using a Bayesian 2528  
approach including verification and validation to demonstrate that the model and data used are fit for the 2529  
intended purpose.  2530

While enhanced modelling strategies are not currently associated with an upper limit for shelf  life and re - 2531  
test period prediction, applicant s should provide risk -based and scientifically justified duration  for the 2532  
proposed shelf  life or re -test period using enhanced approaches. When utilising enhanced stability 2533  
modelling  to support a shelf life or re -test period, the extent of prediction shoul d be based on scientific 2534  
understanding, risk assessment (including totality of available long -term and supportive data), prior 2535  
knowledge (e.g. , representative batches out to the proposed shelf life), considerations of the limits discussed 2536  
in Section 13  - Data Evaluation , container closure limitations, feedback from model lifecycle considerations 2537  
(e.g., emerging confirmatory data) and statistical design.  2538  
A2-2.4 Model Validation and Verification  2539  
A stability model should be shown to be suitable for its intended purpo se. This may be demonstrated 2540  
through validation and verification procedures, for which the methodology would depend on the purpose 2541  
and type of model. A comprehensive approach to model verification and validation should include 2542  
discussion with experts in bo th analytical and statistical approaches. Model predictions may be validated 2543  
by using data from earlier development studies, provided comparability has been demonstrated and the 2544  
batches are considered representative of the commercial material ( refer to Sec tion 4 - Selection of Batches ). 2545  
When a model uses accelerated condition data and the degradation kinetics obey a modified Arrhenius 2546  
equation, the model may be considered as verified  by fit to the modified Arrhenius equation at different 2547  
storage conditions.  2548  
Stability models are not intended to replace long -term data through the proposed re-test period or shelf life , 2549  
which should be performed in addition to the model. Data should be continually obtained and evaluated, as 2550  
confirmatory or ongoing verification, to assess whether the model predictions are still reliable.  Models that 2551  
are built us ing accelerated condition data may include the available long -term stability data as part of the 2552  
model verification.   2553  
A2-2.5 Risk Management  and Model Lifecycle Considerations  2554  
Any stability model that infers or predicts a stability profile beyond the available d rug substance or drug 2555  
product data, incurs an inherent risk.  A description of risk management should be provided in the regulatory 2556  
submission that introduces an enhanced stability model used for setting re -test period or shelf life.  The 2557  
risks in using a stability model should be identified using risk management methodologies (ICH Q9) and , 2558  
when applicable, appropriate mitigation strategies should be in place to reduce those risks through 2559  
verification and validation activities. The resulting risk of using t he stability model should be as low as 2560  
possible. Use of stability models is intended for drug substances and drug products that are well understood, 2561  

Annex 2 Stability Modelling  
ICH Q1 Stability Studies for Drug Substances and Drug Products  
 
A2-14 
  
for which the quality attributes would be known, and their corresponding criticality and residual risks 2562  
evaluated to ensure patient safety. The stability -indicating attributes are also selected,  and the stability 2563  
profile defined. Particular note should be taken in discussing risk presented by any use of “analogous 2564  
molecules” that refers to differences between m olecules that may impact their stability profile and the extent 2565  
that the knowledge is transferable for use in the stability model.   2566  
A stability model, depending on the model type and intended purpose, may require updating through drug 2567  
substance and drug p roduct lifecycle . The need to update a model should be evaluated as part of risk 2568  
management. The risk assessment outcomes (from formal or informal risk management as described in ICH 2569  
Q9) should also be reviewed as new data are obtained through the period t hat the stability model is in use. 2570  
Generally, when a model is used once to establish a re -test period or shelf life it would not be necessary to 2571  
continuously update the model during lifecycle management as long as new long -term stability data are 2572  
obtained that support the identified attribute trend. The post -approval and ongoing monitoring/trending of 2573  
new drug substance or drug product stability data should be managed by the manufacturer’s PQS  2574  
(Pharmaceutical Quality System) . The PQS should be capable of de tecting and managing any unexpected 2575  
changes in stability trend and out of specification results with appropriate corrective action and preventive 2576  
actions (CAPA) as described in ICH Q10, relevant to any stability model being used to establish re -test 2577  
period  or shelf life. Should an unexpected change in trend be confirmed with potential for the attribute to 2578  
exceed acceptance criteria and impact the re -test period or shelf life, the model and its use should be 2579  
reassessed.  2580

Annex  3 Stability  of Advanced  Therapy  Medicinal  Products  (ATMP s) 2582  
A3-1 INTRODUCTION  2583  
Advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) are a diverse category of innovative and complex 2584  
biological products which includes somatic cell therapy, gene therapies and tissue -engineered products. 2585  
ATMPs have several unique characteristics that  should be reflected in the design and execution of the 2586  
stability program. In some circumstances, the mechanism of action may be complex with multiple targets 2587  
and potentially multiple modes of action and , as such, the critical quality attributes are not al ways fully 2588  
understood. Owing to their complex degradation properties, accelerated stability testing conditions may not 2589  
be predictive of the actual degradation profiles during storage. However, if accelerated studies can be 2590  
utilised to support knowledge of the degradation profile and/or stability profile, then data and justification 2591  
can be provided. The small batch size for some patient -specific ATMPs can severely limit the availability 2592  
of material for stability testing. ATMPs that are designed for small pat ient populations may be 2593  
manufactured in small batch sizes or a single batch that may even be sufficient for the entire clinical study, 2594  
leading to challenges in conducting stability studies using multiple production batches. ATMPs are a class  2595  
of therapeutic s, which may have limited prior knowledge available to support model -based approaches to 2596  
the stability assessment. In general, the shelf life for drug substance, intermediate, and/or drug product 2597  
should be based on real -time stability studies.  2598  
This annex p rovides recommendations for designing stability studies for ATMPs. When a topic is not 2599  
included in the Annex, the reader is referred to the core guidance for stability principles that are considered 2600  
generally relevant to ATMPs.  The basic elements of the in formation detailed in Section 3 - Stability 2601  
Protocol Design  through to Section 14 - Labelling  should serve as the basis for designing a stability program 2602  
for ATMPs. For example, where an in -use period is warranted, the applicant should refer to Section 1 1 - 2603  
In-Use Stability for general information on the principles, with the caveat that not all in formation in these 2604  
sections may be directly relevant to ATMPs.   2605  
A3-2 SCOPE  2606  
The recommendations in this annex apply to the assessment of stability considerations for drug substance, 2607  
intermediates, and the drug products of ATMPs as appropriate depending on the pr oduct and the 2608  
manufacturing process. This annex also addresses the stability considerations for starting materials  (e.g., 2609  
viral banks/viral seed stock). Stability considerations for reference materials used in the assessment of 2610  
ATMPs are consistent with th ose for reference materials for other biological s and is discussed under Section 2611  

Annex 3 Stability of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs)  
ICH Q1 Stability Studies for Drug Substances and Drug Products  
 
A3 2 
  
12.1.2 - Consideration for Biological Reference Materials, of the core guidance. The document covers the 2612  
generation and submission of stability data for products containing bi ological active substances such as 2613  
autologous and allogeneic cell -based products (e.g., mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), Islet cells, T-cells, 2614  
NK cells ), xenotransplantation products (e.g., animal derived cell products),  gene therapy products that are 2615  
directly administered to humans (e.g., genetically modified cells, recombinant nucleic acids, viral and 2616  
genetically modified bacterial vectors), oncolytic products, genome editing products and tissue engineered 2617  
products.  2618  
This Annex  is applicable to vectors that are administered directly as a drug product or used ex vivo to 2619  
modify cells (e.g., retroviruses, adeno associated viral and other nucleic acid -based vectors) and viral banks 2620  
used in the manufacture of viral and bacterial vectors . 2621  
Due to the di versity of ATMP products, the stability program should be based on process and product 2622  
knowledge.  The recommendations in this annex will highlight specific differences in product types, but 2623  
any stability plan should consider the type of ATMP product and i ts manufacturing process.  For example, 2624  
the primary stability protocol for a vector -based gene therapy for treating larger patient populations may be 2625  
different from a patient -specific cell -based therapy (i.e., personali sed cellular therapies).  2626  
A3-3 STABILITY STUDY DESIGN  2627  
As outlined in the core guideline, stability studies should be established based on an understanding of the 2628  
product’s CQAs.   ATMP stability study design should be based on process and product knowledge of the 2629  
specific product type a nd manufacturing process. Stability testing frequency should follow the 2630  
recommended testing frequency as detailed in Section  6 – Testing Frequency . When the patient specific 2631  
ATMPs are stored or when the available product lot has a limited quantity, a risk-based  approach to testing 2632  
frequency is recommended and should be justified based on available developmental data and prior 2633  
knowledge. Stability studies for ATMPs may be performed using container closure system differing from 2634  
the commercial system, when jus tified and supported by data showing suitability of the alternative container 2635  
closure system. Shipping stability studies for ATMPs should generally follow the principles described in 2636  
the core guidance. Shipping stability studies for cell based ATMP s should  also include tests to evaluate the 2637  
effect of physical forces exerted during shipping.  2638  
The applicant is encouraged to use a risk -based approach to the design of the stability study. Where a risk - 2639  
based approach is employed, the risk assessment and supportin g justification should be provided.  2640

ICH Q1 Stability Studies for Drug Substances and Drug Products  
 
A3 3 
  
A1-3.1 Selection of Analytical Procedures and Acceptance Criteria  2641  
Selection of analytical procedures and acceptance criteria are detailed in the core guideline (refer to Section 2642  
3.4 - Specification ). Uncertainty surrounding sta bility CQAs due to high assay variability may be mitigated 2643  
by performing orthogonal assays, where for a given CQA, orthogonal assays may provide greater 2644  
confidence in the stability trends over time. Potency is a critical quality attribute for determining s tability 2645  
of ATMPs. However, assessing potency of some ATMPs may be challenging and complex due to 2646  
incomplete knowledge of the mechanism of action of the product, absence of suitable analytical procedures 2647  
to accurately predict the product function, the inhe rent variability in patient -specific products, and due to 2648  
the complex modes of action of the ATMP to exert a given result. Therefore, determining the change in 2649  
potency during storage should be performed through a suitable assurance of the intended biological effect. 2650  
The capability of the chosen potency assay to detect subpotent or degraded product should be justified and 2651  
an evaluation of the degradation profile and its impact on potency provided.  When one assay is not sufficient 2652  
to fully evaluate al l the different product functions, multiple assays may be used to assess potency. For cell - 2653  
based products, this may be evaluated through tests such as cell viability assays, immunochemistry and 2654  
immunoassays for cell surface markers, and assays that evaluat e function (potency). For gene therapy 2655  
products, this may be evaluated through tests such as transduction, infectivity, gene expression, and/or 2656  
activity of the expressed product.  2657  
The purity of the ATMP should be assessed to ensure that storage period and c onditions do not lead to an 2658  
increase in the levels of impurities beyond the demonstrated acceptable range. Impurities in ATMPs result 2659  
from either the manufacturing process or are product related, where the latter may include for instance the 2660  
following impu rities: dead cells, empty viral particles, or degraded products. While process -related 2661  
impurities are controlled during the manufacturing process, storage conditions and duration of storage may 2662  
lead to an increase in the product -related impurities. For thi s reason, a quantitative enumeration of the levels 2663  
of product -related impurities in an ATMP should be assessed and the acceptable stability limits should be 2664  
justified. Stability attributes related to product impurities should be based on a risk assessment at various 2665  
manufacturing and storage steps (e.g., freeze -thaw step). Based on the risk, measurement of representative 2666  
characteristics of the degraded/product derived material may be sufficient to assess stability , when 2667  
performed in combination with other p roduct CQAs . 2668  
In addition to the general considerations for assessing stability of ATMPs, the following are examples for 2669  
product -specific stability considerations that should be evaluated as a part of the stability assessment 2670  
(additional product -specific pa rameters may also be required to assess stability):  2671

• For live cell-based products that are stored frozen, it is important to measure viability of cells after 2672  
they are thawed as part of the stability studies.  The impact of changes in cell viability and cel l 2673  
concentration should be considered for subsequent processing (for intermediates) or dosing (for 2674  
final product).  2675  
• For virus -based products, product CQAs such as changes to total particle number, genome copy 2676  
number,  infectious particle number and viral geno me titre should be included in the stability 2677  
studies.  2678  
• For viral therapy vectors that are used to further modify cells ex vivo , vector integrity, potency and 2679  
strength are stability -indicating CQAs that should normally be included in stability studies.  2680  
• For b acteria -based products, the viability, bacteria count, plasmid copy number (if applicable) 2681  
should be considered.  2682  
• For DNA or RNA based products, stability determination may also include an assessment of 2683  
structural integrity and quantity in addition to othe r purity assessments.  2684  
• For Tissue Engineered products physicochemical and functional critical quality attributes should 2685  
be evaluated as a part of the stability studies. The product’s structural stability may be evaluated 2686  
through tests such as measurement of  size and shape, and assessment of structural integrity. In the 2687  
case of products formulated with carrier or support materials, the stability of the complex formed 2688  
with the drug substance should be studied.  2689  
Acceptance criteria should be justified considerin g the data from material used in preclinical and clinical 2690  
studies. For substances that cannot be properly characterised or products for which an exact analysis of the 2691  
stability -indicating CQA s cannot be determined through routine analytical procedures , the applicant should 2692  
propose and justify alternative testing procedures. The attributes tested for  batch release may not be entirely 2693  
suitable for stability determination for some ATMPs (e.g., definition of mature and immature dendritic cells 2694  
based on the  surface expression of markers such as CD80, CD86, CD83, and MHC II ; percent (%) 2695  
transduced products in case of an ex vivo  modified cellular product; virus phenotype and genetic identity 2696  
of virus). Acceptance criteria for acceptable impurities should be de rived from the analytical profiles of 2697  
batches of the drug substance and drug product used in the preclinical and clinical studies, and batches that 2698  
did not  adversely  impact safety or  potency  should be used to set acceptance limits for impurities . When 2699  
justified, shelf  life specifications may differ from the release specification.  2700

A1-3.2 Selection of Study Conditions  2701  
Recommendations around the selection of study conditions are outlined in the core guideline (refer to 2702  
Section 3 – Stability Protocol Design through Section 7 – Storage Conditions ). It is expected that the 2703  
stability studies for ATMPs include real -time storage and in -use period conditions. Generally, accelerated 2704  
or stress testing may not provide direct information to  support shelf life, however testing under accelerated 2705  
and stressed conditions are recommended for ATMPs. Accelerated studies may be utili sed to gain 2706  
knowledge of the stability profile. Testing under these conditions help in the determination of the extent  of 2707  
temperature deviations that can be tolerated while the harsher stress conditions may provide information 2708  
on the degradation profile of the product. Accelerated or forced degradation studies can also be useful to 2709  
demonstrate the stability -indicating nat ure of assays and their corresponding levels of sensitivity. The 2710  
accelerated conditions defined in Section 7 - Storage Conditions  of the core guideline may not be directly 2711  
applicable for ATMPs, and the accelerated and stressed conditions should be carefull y selected based on a 2712  
risk assessment and worst -case conditions relevant to ATMP’s handling and storage.  2713  
A1-3.3 Selection of Batches  2714  
Recommendations around the selection of batches are outlined in the core guideline. Generally, stability 2715  
data from 3 primary batches are recommended to support the proposed shelf life of ATMPs, however on 2716  
the basis of risk evaluation alternative number of stability batches may be justified. The risk to an accurate 2717  
determination of predicted shelf life of an ATMP  will depend on various factors including the assay 2718  
limitations and variabilities in and the quality of starting materials. The shelf life of ATMPs should 2719  
generally be justified based on long-term stability data  through the proposed shelf life .  In some instances, 2720  
a stability profile based on prior knowledge from analogous products ( refer  to Annex 2 -Stability Modelling ) 2721  
may provide additional supporting stability data. As described in the core guideline Section 4.1 - 2722  
Considerations for Selection of Primary Stability Batches , the manufacturing scale of the primary stability 2723  
batches for ATMPs may differ from that of the p roduction batch, unless the scale change represents a 2724  
significant risk to stability. Primary stability batches may be clinical batches not at production scale, 2725  
provided appropriate comparability has been demonstrated to production batches. When primary bat ches 2726  
are not production scale batches, a post -approval commitment may be required to confirm the stability.  2727  
Stability of patient -specific cellular ATMPs should be obtained from patient derived materials. However, 2728  
this may not always be feasible due to limi ted availability (e.g ., autologous CAR -T cells), and when 2729  
justified, stability data from representative healthy donor derived materials along with stability data from 2730  
patient -derived material may be acceptable. When patient derived material is only availab le in limited 2731  

Annex 3 Stability of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs)  
ICH Q1 Stability Studies for Drug Substances and Drug Products  
 
A3 6 
  
quantities to perform the recommended stability studies as per the stability protocol, the principles of 2732  
bracketing ( refer  to Annex 1  - Reduced Stability Protocol Design)  may be applied to ATMPs.  Stability - 2733  
indicating CQAs that are assessed to  determine stability will depend on the drug product and should be 2734  
justified.  Stability of cryopreserved cells used as cell substrates for the manufacture of ATMPs may apply 2735  
the principle of model ling based on prior knowledge (e.g., cell type, formulation , container, cell density) to 2736  
set initial shelf life beyond long-term data at submission.  2737  
ATMPs may differ in the standard manufacturing process flow without having distinct bulk drug substance 2738  
batches and manufactured in one uninterrupted stream with no distinct drug substance storage step. Under 2739  
such circumstances, there would not be a need t o evaluate the storage period of a drug substance. Examples 2740  
of this type of manufacturing include a number of cell -based products that are continuously cultured, 2741  
purified, formulated and stored (or administered fresh) as the final ready -to-use drug product .   2742  
For ATMPs that have a distinct drug substance stage, the date of manufacturing of the drug substance and 2743  
the date of manufacturing of the drug product may be two separate dates and the duration of storage of the 2744  
drug substance prior to it being process ed into the final drug product may influence the storage period of 2745  
the drug product.  If this is the case, a risk assessment should be performed to determine if the stability 2746  
assessments should also take into consideration the cumulative storage period of the drug substance and 2747  
drug product.  2748  
When the manufacturing process includes a short hold time, a risk assessment to determine the need and 2749  
extent of hold time stability studies should be assessed and justified. Some ATMP manufacturing process 2750  
may include  a freezing step (e.g., short term storage of cells prior to further processing). In such instances, 2751  
the stability of the stored intermediate should be evaluated upon thaw.  2752  
A3-4 STARTING MATERIALS AND STABILITY  2753  
The protocol should take into consideration that stability of  ATMPs may be affected by the quality of 2754  
starting materials and viral vectors, and stability assessment should consider the impact of starting materials 2755  
for cell therapy products (e.g., allogenic, autologous cells), transport, storage steps in the manufacturing 2756  
process, and their short or long -term storage conditions (e.g., short -term cell storage versus long -term 2757  
cryopreservation).  The stability of cellular starting materials (e.g., donor cells) should be assessed during 2758  
their storage and ship ping. In general, assessment of stability of cellular starting materials during their 2759  
storage and shipping should follow the recommendations detailed in this guideline for cell based ATMPs 2760  
and should follow a risk based approach to determining their stabil ity. Stability of starting materials used 2761  

Annex 3 Stability of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs)  
ICH Q1 Stability Studies for Drug Substances and Drug Products  
 
A3 7 
  
to manufacture gene therapy vectors (e.g., plasmids, virus banks used to make vectors) should also be 2762  
controlled.    2763  
Viral vectors  that are used to modify cells ex vivo to make ATMPs  (e.g., retrovirus, lentivirus)  are normally 2764  
manufactured in bulk, purified and adjusted for a desired concentration and stored frozen until use.  Stored 2765  
viral vectors should be assessed for stability related CQAs, such as  vector integrity, strength (e.g., infectious 2766  
titre, transducing titre, genomic titre and viral particle count), product related impurity profile, ratio of 2767  
empty to full particles (if applicable), activity  (e.g., gene expression), and sterility (or container closure 2768  
integrity testing). When the viral vectors are stored a t varying concentrations, stability of the viral vectors 2769  
at each individual concentration should be assessed, unless bracketing is justified ( refer to Annex 1 - 2770  
Reduced Stability Protocol Design ). 2771  
A3-4.1 Cell and Viral Banks  2772  
The stability of cell banks under defined storage conditions should be generated to verify that the thawed 2773  
cells have survived the preservation process and retain their CQAs, consistent with the recommendations 2774  
outlined in ICH Q5D. A stability protocol for monitoring of banked cells should  be provided in the 2775  
submission. Stability -indicating CQAs that are assessed to determine stability should be justified.  2776  
Stability of viral banks that are either used in the production of viral drug products for direct administration 2777  
or for viral vectors us ed in the production of in vitro  modification of cells should be evaluated for stability.  2778  
The quality of the viral bank should be well established and would typically include an evaluation of its 2779  
stability -indicating CQAs. When establishing the stability period of viral banks, virus stability may be 2780  
demonstrated in some cases through assessing the quality attributes of the drug substance, manufactured 2781  
from the stored material at the end of the viral bank’s shelf life. The stability of the established maste r viral 2782  
banks (also referred to as viral seed stock in some regions) and working viral banks should be evaluated 2783  
periodically per a stability protocol. The stability protocol should describe and justify the test parameters 2784  
and stability acceptance criteria  which should be based on its intended use. Potency may also be a stability - 2785  
indicating CQA, depending on the intended use of the viral bank (e.g., when used to manufacture a viral 2786  
drug product). Depending on the intended use of the viral bank (e.g., when u sed to manufacture a viral drug 2787  
product), infectious titre may also be a stability -indicating  CQA and  should be included as a part of viral 2788  
bank’s stability assessments.  2789

A3-5 ESTABLISHMENT OF SHELF LIFE  2790  
The shelf life of ATMPs may not be accurately predicted fr om accelerated stability studies, as their 2791  
behaviour  can vary considerably based on the temperature and related changes in the storage medium. 2792  
When the accelerated stability studies only provide a limited information, due to differences in degradation 2793  
profile, stability studies designed to support product stability should be performed in real time, under the 2794  
intended storage conditions. When sufficient real -time stability data from the production lot is not available 2795  
for ATMPs, stability data from developme ntal batches  and prior knowledge from similar products may be 2796  
used as supporting data to justify setting initial stability period, with a concurrent testing strategy built into 2797  
the stability testing protocol. The use of prior knowledge to support shelf lif e determination of an ATMP 2798  
should be discussed with regulatory authorities as appropriate.  2799  
A minimum of 6 months stability data should be included at the time of submission. The shelf life may be 2800  
extended beyond the initial 6 -month period when additional stability data becomes available.  For drug 2801  
products with storage periods of less than 6 months, the minimum amount of stability data in the initial  2802  
regulatory submission  should cover the intended shelf life.   2803  
ATMPs that have a storage period at the drug substance stage and at the drug product stage should be 2804  
assessed for stability under the stability protocol as detailed in Section 3 - Stability Protocol Design  of the 2805  
core guidance. When intermediates used in the manufacture of cellular products and viral vectors are 2806  
stored, they should also be assessed for their stability under a pre -specified stability program and a shelf 2807  
life established  based on real -time sta bility informatio n. 2808
