ivForeword
A core role of World Health Organization (WHO) is to support strengthening of national capabilities in the 
health sector. WHO considers that strengthening of country-led research and development (R&D) ecosystems to 
advance health science and facilitate faster and more equitable access to safe and effective health interventions 
is of the utmost importance to a country’s population health and economic well-being. Clinical trials are an 
essential component of a strong country-driven R&D ecosystem. 
Unnecessary bureaucracy, uncoordinated approval processes and the lack of an enabling environment are 
currently barriers in some countries and as a result slow down and prevent equitable access for people to health 
innovation that can save and transform lives. In 2022 the World Health Assembly adopted resolution (WHA 
75.8) “Strengthening clinical trials to improve high quality evidence on health interventions and to improve 
research quality and coordination” , which called on WHO to develop this guidance. Throughout the guidance 
a major focus is to address public health priorities through clinical and public health research, and in particular 
to address the health needs of developing countries in an equitable manner. Importantly, enhancing clinical 
trial capacity is essential for all countries with many efficiency gains possible in high-income countries as well 
as middle- and low-income countries. Therefore, the reforms called for can have a major impact worldwide.
This guidance has a number of recommendations. Firstly, patient, participant and community engagement 
are placed centrally in the trial planning and implementation phases to ensure the research meets public 
needs and maintains trust. Secondly, major new recommendations are included on reforms that enable 
trials in underrepresented populations such as children, pregnant women and older adults. Thirdly, the 
guidance lays out how to focus trial design and oversight on the key scientific and ethical considerations that 
determine whether trials are ethical, efficient and informative. Here risk based and proportionate approaches 
are advocated so that we move away from one size fits all oversight or audit, to those that are tailored to risk. 
For the first time in WHO guidance, recommendations are provided that can practically assist national health 
authorities, regulatory authorities, funders and others in how best they can facilitate clinical trials and research 
to enable evidence generation on health interventions. Sustained domestic support and resources are the 
only way to finance this transformation. Longstanding recommendations, also referred to in previous World 
Health Assembly resolutions, on a minimum spending of 2% of health budgets on Science and R&D, and 5% 
of health-related development assistance on research have not been met by many countries, and in other 
countries resources are needed for reform rather than supporting uncoordinated processes.
Countries that choose to prioritize and resource a reformed clinical research ecosystem, enabling the work 
of their clinical researchers with input from the public, private sector and local communities, will gain major 
benefits including:
• Improved trust between the public and the health research community
• Better locally derived evidence for clinical practitioners and public health decisions
• Improved health outcomes, faster and more equitable access to innovation and medical products that 
are better tailored to individual patient needs, and hence progress towards health-related sustainable 
development goals (SDGs)

v
Foreword• National resilience and security including a more robust clinical trial ecosystem ensuring faster response 
to health crisis
• Healthier populations and more productive economies
• Economic benefits from a thriving science and innovation ecosystem that provides opportunities for jobs, 
spin outs into new small and medium sized companies along with private sector investment
In coordination and collaboration with its partners, WHO is committed to provide support to countries that 
wish to apply this guidance to reform, improve and streamline their oversight and approval processes and 
hence strengthen their clinical research system.

xExecutive summary
Objective
This document responds to requests by the World Health Assembly to the Director-General in resolution 
WHA75.8 (2022) on strengthening clinical trials to provide high-quality evidence on health interventions and 
to improve research quality and coordination (3) to identify and propose best practices and other measures to 
strengthen the global clinical trial ecosystem and to review existing guidance and develop new guidance as 
needed on best practices for clinical trials. This guidance updates and adapts the previous work of the World 
Health Organization (WHO) on research capacity (4) for the context of well-designed and well-implemented 
clinical trials as framed in resolution WHA75.8 (2022). It aims to enhance clinical research efficiency, minimize 
research waste and provide guidance on sustained clinical trials that are always functional and active for 
endemic conditions and can pivot in time of emergency or pandemics.
Section 1  provides an introduction. For key scientific and ethical considerations for well-designed and well-
implemented trials the reader should refer directly to Section 2 . For guidance on strengthening the clinical 
trial ecosystem, including capacity development and addressing inefficiencies, refer to Section 3  and for 
recommendations to Member States, research funders and researchers refer to Annex 2 .
Scope
This document is intended to provide guidance to WHO’s Member States and any staff members of non-State 
actor organizations whose work is related to clinical trials in any way, including the planning, conduct, analysis, 
oversight, interpretation and funding of all clinical trials to assess the effects of any health intervention for any 
purpose in any setting. Such staff members include those involved in educating others about clinical trials. 
The remit includes:
• any design for a clinical trial: but with a focus on randomized clinical trials, including comparisons of two 
or more interventions, whether blinded or not, and whether parallel, cluster, crossover, factorial, adaptive 
platform, decentralized or other design;  
• any health intervention: including (but not limited to) administration of pharmaceutical medicines, cells 
and other biological products, and vaccines; surgical or radiological procedures; diagnostics; use of 
medical devices, nutritional measures; cognitive, behavioural and psychological interventions; supportive 
or preventive care, including process-of-care changes; physical therapy interventions; digital and public 
health approaches; traditional or herbal measures; and screening processes. The interventions may be 
novel or pre-existing but being used in a different way (for example, repurposed or optimized) or to gain 
further knowledge about current practices;
• any purpose: including (but not limited to) evidence for guideline development; recommendations for 
clinical practice or public health strategies; and health technology assessments;

xi
Executive summary• any setting: any geographical, economic or societal context, and any context including clinical trials 
based in hospital, primary care or community settings; or where the intervention is delivered directly to 
a participant;
• any role: including researchers and clinicians, patient and public groups (including trial participants), 
regulators and other national health authorities, ethics committees and institutional review boards, 
research funders, and all trial sponsors (academic, government, nonprofit and commercial). 
There will often be important local, national or regional contextual factors or regulations that are crucial to 
consider, and national bodies working with local patient groups and affected communities are best placed 
to ensure appropriate local adaptation of this guidance and compliance with universal scientific and ethical 
standards. 
This document aims to complement other guidance in order to support implementation of universal ethical 
and scientific standards in the context of clinical trials, with a focus on under-represented populations; it does 
not represent a legal standard and does not supersede any existing guidance. In particular, this guidance shares 
many common concepts and principles with guidance produced by the International Council for Harmonisation 
of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) (5), especially the ICH E8(R1) General 
Considerations for Clinical Studies guideline (6), (the draft ICH E6(R3) Good Clinical Practice guideline (7), and 
the ICH E9 statistical principles guideline (8) and its associated addendum (9). In addition, it shares attributes 
with two further recent guidance documents that were highlighted through WHO’s public consultation process 
in 2022: those of the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) on clinical research in 
resource-limited settings (10) and the Good Clinical Trials Collaborative (GCTC) (11). Both the CIOMS and GCTC 
guidance have served as sources, with adaptations as needed, for this document. Additional sources highlighted 
through the consultation include the World Medical Association’s (WMA) Declaration of Helsinki  (12) on medical 
research involving human subjects, the WMA Declaration of Taipei on Ethical Considerations regarding Health 
Databases and Biobanks (13) and CIOMS’ International Ethical Guidelines on Health-related Research involving 
Humans (2016) (14).
For clinical trials designed to support submission to regulatory authorities concerned with medicinal products, 
trial sponsors should also refer to the ICH guidelines, in particular ICH E8 (R1) (6) and ICH E6(R3) (7) and other 
relevant ICH guidelines, along with any relevant guidance issued by the authorities to which they plan to submit. 
As noted above, the scope of this WHO guidance is restricted to neither medicinal products nor clinical trials 
conducted in support of regulatory approval.
Approach to development
In March 2023, under the guidance of the WHO Technical Advisory Group (TAG) for the Development of Best 
Practices for Clinical Trials, the initial guidance was drafted by Vasee Moorthy and Christina Reith, drawing 
from existing CIOMS and GCTC guidance. The TAG provided feedback on this draft in writing and during a 
teleconference in May 2023. This feedback was incorporated into a revised draft, which was published on the 
WHO website for public consultation from July to September 2023. 
The WHO Secretariat disseminated the public consultation for the draft guidance to regional offices, relevant 
headquarters technical programs, professional networks, non-state actors in official relations with the WHO, 
and other key stakeholders in clinical research. A total of 179 responses from 48 countries were received, with 
approximately 30% from academic stakeholders, followed by non-governmental organizations and national 
health or regulatory authorities. Additionally, the WHO Secretariat organized a consultation with private sector 

Guidance for best practices for clinical trialsxii
Guidance for best practices for clinical trialsrepresentatives at a side event during the 76th World Health Assembly and held an information session to 
gather feedback from Member States in September 2023. 
A global stakeholder survey was launched in August 2023, in collaboration with the WHO Collaborating Centre 
for research information sharing, e-learning, and capacity development, to identify barriers in conducting 
clinical trials and propose priority actions. Nearly 3000 participants worldwide responded to the survey. 
Outcomes from the global stakeholder survey were further discussed in in-person consultations held in Brasilia, 
Brazil; Lusaka, Zambia; Delhi, India; Cairo, Egypt; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; and Geneva, Switzerland, attended 
by about 300 experts and stakeholders. These consultations provided additional input for the draft guidance 
on strengthening the clinical trial ecosystem. 
The final guidance, prepared by Vasee Moorthy and Christina Reith, integrated all received feedback. In April 
2023, a TAG meeting was held to review the final draft before its submission for executive clearance and 
publication. 
Declarations of interest were collected from all members of the WHO Technical Advisory Group (TAG) that 
oversaw the development of the guidance and any relevant interests are publicly disclosed on the website 
for the TAG.

21.1 Clinical research: importance 
and types
Clinical research is indispensable for resolving public 
health challenges. Clinical research studies can be 
thought of as spanning five generic areas of activity:
• measuring the magnitude and distribution of 
the health problem;
• understanding the diverse causes or the 
determinants of the problem, whether they 
are due to biological, behavioural, social or 
environmental factors;
• developing solutions or interventions that will 
help to prevent, mitigate or cure the problem; 
• implementing or delivering solutions through 
policies and programmes; and
• evaluating the impact of these solutions on the 
level and distribution of the problem.
Clinical studies broadly fall into two groups: non-
interventional and interventional.
Non-interventional studies are observational in 
nature (hence sometimes known as observational 
studies), in which health outcomes are typically 
compared between individuals who received or were 
exposed to a certain factor and those who did not, 
and in which the allocation to treatment or exposure 
is not predetermined by a study protocol. 
In contrast, interventional clinical studies (known as 
clinical trials) evaluate the effects of prospectively 
assigning subjects to one or more interventions 
on health outcomes. For comparisons of two or 
more interventions, a key aspect of such prospective 
assignment is the process of randomization to help 1. Introduction

are assessed reliably; the key importance of why this 
matters is discussed in Section 1.2  and Section  2 . 
Such clinical trials are known as randomized 
clinical trials (RCTs), with the intervention to which 
a participant is allocated sometimes referred 
to as an “arm” of a clinical trial. RCTs may involve 
prospective allocation of individuals  to interventions 
or prospective allocation of a group  of people (for 
example, in a particular community, school or 
region), and are sometimes known as cluster RCTs.  
There are, however, some circumstances where 
prospective assignment necessarily does not support 
randomization, such as clinical trials very early in an 
intervention’s development, or in some oncological, 
rare disease and diagnostics trials whereby only one 
intervention is tested (that is, “single arm” trials).
Clinical trial interventions may include (but are 
not limited to) administration of pharmaceutical 
medicines, cells and other biological products, 
and vaccines; surgical or radiological procedures; 
diagnostics; use of medical devices, nutritional 
measures; cognitive, behavioural and psychological 
interventions; supportive or preventive care, 
including process-of-care changes; physical 
therapy interventions; digital and public health 
approaches; traditional or herbal measures; and 
screening processes. The interventions may be 
novel or pre-existing but being used in a different 
way (for example, repurposed or optimized) or to 
gain further knowledge about current practice. In 
RCTs, interventions may include placebo or another 
comparator (sometimes known as a control) and may 
provide no additional active intervention beyond 
usual practice or standard care.
Clinical trials may be carried out at any level of the 
health system, from home, community or primary 
level care through to secondary, tertiary or intensive 
care settings. 

3
1. IntroductionIn addition to traditional parallel-group RCTs, a 
range of further trial designs exists, including (but 
not limited to) crossover, factorial, adaptive and 
platform trials. In addition, the variety of options 
for performing any of these trial designs is wide, 
depending on the nature of the trial. These can 
include decentralized trials, point of care trials and 
more traditional investigator location-based trials, or, 
more commonly, combinations of these elements in 
a single trial.
Platform, basket and umbrella trials all use master 
protocols (15–18)  which allow simultaneous 
evaluation of multiple interventions within the same 
overall trial structure. Platform trials are designed to 
study multiple interventions among people with one 
or more closely related diseases (for example, cancers 
due to genomic subtypes) or health conditions (for 
example, pneumonia). They may use a common 
control group (for example, treatment A vs treatment 
B vs a common control) or, more efficiently, a factorial 
design that involves more than one randomized 
comparison (for example, treatment A vs placebo 
A and treatment B vs placebo B) such that some 
participants may get more than one active treatment 
while a minority receives a placebo. They are efficient 
and flexible, allowing for modification of the ongoing 
trial in the light of accumulating trial data, with new 
research questions being introduced as amendments 
rather than as new trials. For example, arms can 
be added to test new interventions once initial 
questions have been addressed, while existing arms 
may be discontinued if it becomes apparent that 
an intervention is ineffective or harmful based on 
predefined decision algorithms. Such platform trials 
can be open-ended and with intervention arms 
added at different points in time. In particular, the 
emergence of large adaptive platform trials with 
pragmatic features embedded into health systems 
was pivotal in generating evidence for use of 
therapeutics in coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Increasingly, trials also use streamlined “decentralized” 
approaches (19) (where some aspects are delivered 
in or close to people’s homes) or point-of-care 
designs (where a trial is conducted in clinical practice 
settings). Such trials can address critical questions 
in clinical care settings rather than in specialized 
research environments. (20)All clinical trials should help to resolve important 
uncertainties about the effects of health 
interventions. Depending on the context, the 
results may be needed to determine whether to 
proceed with development, further evaluation of the 
intervention or inform regulatory licensing, clinical 
guidelines and/or health policy. In each case, any 
uncertainties applying to the specific question(s) 
that remain at the end of the clinical trial should be 
sufficiently small to allow meaningful decisions to 
be made.
1.2 Ascertainment of treatment 
effects: observational studies 
vs clinical trials
Observational studies and clinical trials are both 
highly valuable in clinical research and may be 
complementary. However, they must be designed 
and analysed appropriately, and used in the right 
context (21–24) . Robust observational studies can 
be extremely useful for identifying associations of 
risk factors with disease (with good examples being 
smoking with lung cancer, and blood pressure and 
cholesterol with cardiovascular disease), but their 
value for the assessment of the effects of treatment 
is more limited.  Observational studies may also 
have an important role in the identification of large 
effects (adverse or beneficial) of an intervention 
on rare health outcomes that would not normally 
be expected to occur, particularly those that are 
not likely to be related to the indications for (or 
contraindications to) the intervention of interest.  
A major limitation of observational studies is their 
inherent potential biases. One of the most important 
of these is confounding, in which a factor is associated 
with an exposure of interest (but is not a direct 
consequence of it) and, independently, influences 
the risk of the outcome of interest. For example, 
“confounding by indication (or contraindication)”  
may occur when a treatment tends to be provided 
more (or less) frequently to individuals with 
conditions associated with increased or decreased 
risks of the outcome of interest. This type of bias can 
produce misleading estimates not just of the size 
but also of the direction of treatment effects, and 
these can remain even after statistical adjustment 
for observed differences between different groups 

Guidance for best practices for clinical trials4
Guidance for best practices for clinical trialsof individuals. Equally, biases can arise owing to 
differences in ascertainment or detection of an 
outcome. In addition, the reliability of recall of 
treatment exposure can differ between those who 
develop a certain outcome and those who do not. 
These potential biases mean that observational 
studies can be unreliable for determining the effects 
of health interventions, especially when (as can often 
be the case) the effects of the treatment of interest 
are only moderate or null (25).
Discussion of design considerations and methods to 
avoid bias and confounding in observational studies 
is beyond the scope of this guideline. However, 
this limitation is highly relevant because most 
interventions for most common serious conditions 
have only modest effects on health and disease, even 
if they have a large effect on intermediate features 
(for example, physiological or laboratory tests). 
However, even modest improvements in health 
can be important, particularly if the intervention 
can be used widely for a common condition or if 
multiple interventions with moderate effects can be 
used in combination, provided any benefits are not 
substantially offset by detrimental effects. Therefore, 
it is vital that these modest effects are detected 
reliably. This requires clinical trials that ensure 
stringent control over systematic errors such as biases 
and confounding factors (which, in general, requires 
proper methods in randomization, blinding and 
masking, as well as appropriate statistical analysis) 
and strict control of random error (which necessitates 
appropriate sample sizes). RCTs therefore have a 
central role in generating the evidence needed 
to inform the development and implementation 
of health interventions, because they can reliably 
determine whether a health intervention is safe 
and effective by ensuring that any biases or random 
errors inherent in the study design are small with 
respect to the expected treatment effect. The results 
of such RCTs and their associated meta-analyses 
(whereby data from multiple clinical trials addressing 
a similar research question are statistically combined) 
(21) have been transformative in advancing global 
public health. 1.3 The clinical trials environment: 
an evolving landscape
The clinical trial environment has evolved 
substantially since the concepts of clinical trials 
were introduced, with important changes having 
also taken place in the social, ethical and regulatory 
environment globally. There is now a broader 
recognition of the very large health, social and 
economic returns on investments in research. Clinical 
trials and the development of interventions are being 
supported by industry, non-industry parties (such as 
academic institutions), government agencies and 
public–private partnerships, sometimes with support 
from external partners in translational research.
In terms of ethical principles there have been 
revisions of the Declaration of Helsinki (12) and 
development of guidance on clinical trials, notably 
the CIOMS international ethical guidelines (14). 
In terms of regulatory guidelines, ICH clinical trial 
guidelines are available, in particular ICH E8(R1)  (6) 
and ICH E6(R3) (7). There is also recent guidance 
from the Good Clinical Trials Collaborative (11), as 
well as the creation of new or updated guidance or 
pathways being developed by regulators.  
Also, interest has grown in trials methodology, 
including increasing use of flexible and practical 
approaches to trial design, with a growing recognition 
of how routinely collected data, sometimes known 
as real world data, can add value and drive efficiency 
of clinical trials. For example, data relating to patient 
health status and/or the delivery of health care 
routinely collected from a variety of sources (such as 
electronic health records, medical claims data, data 
from product or disease registries, and data gathered 
through digital health technologies) can be used to 
help with the enrolment and outcome ascertainment 
in trials (26–29) . 
Patient organizations and advocacy groups have 
come to the fore globally in recent years, advocating 
patient, community and public involvement in clinical 
trials as a cornerstone in the design and conduct of 
clinical trials. However, more remains to be done to 
ensure that trial design and implementation include 
adequate engagement with patients, communities 
and the public. This guidance includes elements on 

5
1. Introductionsuch engagement that will not only help to ensure 
that clinical trials are relevant to the populations 
they are intended to serve, but also raise awareness 
of the role of clinical research in public health and 
the quality of life. Guidance and initiatives for patient 
involvement and good participatory practice in 
clinical trials have been developed, by WHO and 
others, available across a range of interventions and 
settings (30–38) . 
The way in which information is shared and 
communicated is also rapidly evolving. This 
provides valuable opportunities for more efficient, 
collaborative and transparent trial processes, but 
also presents potential risks in terms of a growing 
potential for global propagation of misinformation 
or “fake news” which is detrimental to public 
health. Well-designed RCTs and the maintenance 
and promotion of clear, valid sources for reliable 
information on their design and results are a strong 
defence against misinformation.
In areas of medicine where clinical trials are common, 
such as oncology, cardiovascular disease and some 
infectious diseases, patient outcomes have markedly 
improved as interventions and service delivery have 
been iteratively enhanced. 
While the focus of this guidance is on later-stage 
RCTs that evaluate safety and effectiveness of 
interventions, earlier-stage translational research is 
another valuable area that has emerged as central to 
advancing health outcomes, by acting as the bridge 
between basic science and later-stage evaluations.
Applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in the clinical 
trials arena were advancing rapidly at the time of 
finalizing this guidance, including but not restricted 
to drug and vaccine discovery and molecule design, 
AI-enhanced diagnostic approaches, predictive 
modelling of trial outcome intended to improve 
trial design, participant recruitment and retention 
and digitization.
All these factors have significantly changed the 
environment for clinical trials. However, the research 
landscape must continue to evolve to fulfil its 
potential.1.4 Persistent challenges to clinical 
trial enablement
There is an urgent need to avoid wasteful procedures 
and make clinical trials more efficient so that they can 
be done on an adequate scale to produce reliable 
evidence at reasonable costs. This is because, despite 
the widely recognized importance of clinical trials, in 
many areas of health the evidence base remains 
weak, with decision-making processes lacking 
results from enough well-designed and well-
conducted clinical trials. This problem is global, 
affecting high-, middle- and low-income countries.  
The result can be failure to identify and use effective 
and safe interventions or the continuing use of 
ineffective or hazardous interventions; for example, 
millions of doses of ineffective treatments were used 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a consequence, 
resources are wasted through both direct immediate 
costs and indirect downstream costs, unnecessary 
harm or suffering may be caused, and trust is reduced 
in those who develop or use health interventions. The 
need to reduce research waste is a long-recognized 
global issue affecting clinical trials across a spectrum 
of settings, with urgency to address this problem 
having been the focus of much discussion. However, 
it was particularly highlighted by the research 
response to the pandemic of COVID-19: more 
than 22  000 COVID-19-related clinical trials were 
registered, of which the vast majority are thought to 
have contributed little to the evidence base. A small 
proportion of such clinical trials (whether publicly 
or non-publicly funded), probably less than 10%, 
were well-designed and well-implemented (with a 
widespread problem being that many such clinical 
trials were not randomized and/or sufficiently large 
to answer their intended question) and contributed 
meaningfully to policy recommendations by WHO 
and other bodies. 
This waste in clinical trials results from various 
factors. These include clinical trials never being 
done or completed, failure to articulate clear 
research questions, duplication of previous 
research, use of inefficient trial processes, failure to 
produce scientifically robust and clinically relevant 
answers, or results never being published. The lost 
opportunity cost of trials that are poorly designed 
or not completed and reported is significant and 
results in draining of available resources which 

Guidance for best practices for clinical trials6
Guidance for best practices for clinical trialsare not then available to conduct and complete 
well-designed trials. Additionally, a prevailing 
risk-averse mentality hampers innovation and 
the adoption of new perspectives, leading to 
disproportionately burdensome trial processes and 
data collection practices. The absence of efficient 
and coordinated procedures for approving clinical 
trials poses a significant challenge, characterized by 
vast intercountry and inter-regional heterogeneity 
in approval processes by regulatory and ethics 
authorities. Some countries have mature systems, 
but these may still have significant inefficiencies 
and over-utilise risk-averse approaches. If approval 
processes are unduly lengthy, enthusiasm and the 
ability to enrol large numbers in local populations 
may wane. Such delays can lead to a reduction in 
evidence generated for exactly the types of people 
such authorities are trying to benefit. Many countries 
also lack the necessary resources for a robust 
infrastructure or have not yet achieved adequate 
efficiency. The multitude of applications with various 
processes and lengthy timelines results in delayed 
initiation of trials and may lead to a loss of motivation 
to engage in clinical research. This issue intensifies 
for multiregional or international trials, important 
for achieving both statistical power and broad 
representativeness. Intermittent use of clinical trial 
infrastructure also specifically needs to be addressed 
to avoid periodic fallow or “cold” periods in clinical 
trial activity, primarily driven by project-based 
research and intermittent clinical trial funding. This 
problem results in inefficiencies, skill loss and neglect 
of key areas in the clinical trial ecosystem.
A lack of adequate funding for clinical trials remains 
a major issue globally with ongoing disparities in 
investment and access to clinical trial infrastructure 
especially when taken in context of global disease 
burden (39). The result is inequity and a lack of justice 
in fairly accessing affordable, safe and efficacious 
interventions, the consequences of which were 
particularly highlighted during the COVID-19 
pandemic.
This state of affairs is particularly prominent in 
resource-limited settings and areas where the 
traditional model of development of interventions 
does not provide incentives for research and 
development (R&D), with trials undertaken in high-
income countries (HICs) historically dominating, focusing on diseases prevalent in those settings. The 
result has been an increasingly conducive clinical trials 
environment, infrastructure and capacity to address 
the health priorities of HICs and commercial market 
interests. In contrast, the limited health care and 
research capacity and/or commercial viability in low- 
and middle-income countries (LMICs)1 means that 
clinical research in these regions has often focused on 
observational or implementation studies conducted 
after the registration or approval of an intervention in 
HICs. However, populations in (LMICs) bear the highest 
burden of preventable disease globally, facing several 
specific challenges. First, they continue to face a high 
level of communicable diseases, such as neonatal 
sepsis, malaria, tuberculosis, chronic hepatitis B and C, 
HIV infection/AIDS, diarrhoeal diseases and neglected 
tropical diseases, and in some areas are being seriously 
impacted by epidemic outbreaks of diseases, which 
affect different regions in different ways. In 2021, 
children up to 14 years of age accounted for 25% of 
the global population and 42% of the population 
in low-income countries (40). Secondly, neonatal, 
maternal and nutritional diseases are prevalent, and 
neonatal, under-5 and maternal mortality is high 
in LMICs, although declining. In addition, LMICs 
have similar rates of noncommunicable diseases to 
those in upper-middle- and high-income countries 
but lack adequate clinical trial focus outside such 
more affluent settings. Thirdly, although the disease 
burden in LMICs has decreased since 1990, with 
communicable diseases projected to fall further over 
time, their burden from noncommunicable diseases 
will become proportionally higher. 
Although trials in LMICs do take place, they tend 
to be funded by international donors from HICs, 
or by industry, as opposed to being able to be 
resourced by LMICs themselves. There is therefore 
a pressing need to promote and advance efficient 
and sustained well-designed and well-implemented 
clinical trials that address local health needs across 
all stages of clinical research in LMICs and other 
resource-limited settings (39), encompassing both 
communicable and noncommunicable diseases in 
1 The World Bank’s bands of income levels are commonly used to classify countries 
in terms of resources. In this document the term LMICs refers to the World Bank 
country classifications, whereas resource-limited settings refer to locales that 
may be common in low-income countries but may also exist in middle- and 
high-income countries, for example in remote and/or deprived communities. 
Moreover, a setting can change over time and may no longer be considered low-
resource or newly become low-resource.

7
1. Introductionorder to address the morbidity and mortality risks 
affecting people in those settings.  If this does not 
occur, entire populations could miss out on the 
vaccines, diagnostics and other interventions that are 
needed as part of sustainable development globally. 
Moreover, conducting research in LMICs can 
foster capacity-building. By investing in training 
programmes and constructing laboratory facilities 
that meet international standards, research funders 
can contribute to the development of the necessary 
infrastructure and resources to execute high-quality 
research in LMICs. This, in turn, can lead to functional 
international networks and a sustained and equitable 
global health research landscape.
Inequities in post-trial access to interventions 
tested in clinical trials also remain a major concern, 
especially in relation to LMICs. Indeed, there have 
been examples of trials where the disease burden 
in LMICs led to them being targeted for inclusion in 
clinical trials, yet these data were then used to file 
for marketing authorization in HICs or high-resource 
settings, often leading to availability of interventions 
in the latter but not the former. Similarly, trials of 
diagnostics that took place in LMICs or low-resource 
settings have sometimes failed to provide any post-
diagnostic support for those with the diagnosed 
condition. These are examples of exploitation and a 
clear breach of ethical principles, and there must be 
a more systematic end-to-end approach for ensuring 
that new interventions are globally affordable and 
accessible, from discovery through to development 
and distribution.
Inequities in leadership in clinical trials is an 
unresolved barrier. Local researchers, funders, 
communities and organizations should share an 
equal leadership role in prioritization, design, 
implementation and reporting of clinical trials..
A further major challenge is that clinical trial 
cohorts have often lacked diversity, with under-
representation of certain populations, resulting in 
them being underserved by clinical trials, including 
(but not limited to):
Groups by demographic factors
• age extremes: neonates, infants, children and 
adolescents (despite this group representing a large proportion of the population in some 
settings) and older people (with elderly patients 
often being excluded from clinical trials on 
account of their being more comorbid and 
hence thought likely, but incorrectly, to obscure 
potential effects of an intervention even when 
there is a comparator group; this is an issue 
since they often carry a significant burden of 
disease and therefore represent a population in 
whom absolute effects of an intervention may 
be particularly large)
• women of child-bearing age
• pregnant and lactating women
• different ethnic minority groups
• male/female sex (depending on trial context, 
although women were often previously under-
represented);
Groups by social and economic factors
• people living in remote areas
• socioeconomically disadvantaged
• socially marginalized people
• stigmatized populations including LGBTQI+ 
people
• people in alternative residential circumstances 
(for example, migrants, asylum seekers, refugees, 
occupants of care homes, prison populations, 
traveller communities, the homeless and those 
of no fixed abode)
• religious minorities
• people who do not attend regular medical 
appointments
• people who face language barriers and digital 
exclusion/disadvantage
• carers
• military veterans;

Guidance for best practices for clinical trials8
Guidance for best practices for clinical trialsGroups by health status
• multimorbidity
• people who lack the capacity to give consent for 
themselves
• cognitive impairment
• learning disability
• people with neglected tropical diseases
• people with addictions
• people with multiple health conditions or those 
who are severely ill
• people with physical disabilities or who are 
visually/ hearing impaired
• people with rare diseases and genetic disease 
subtypes.
Such lack of clinical trial inclusivity and diversity 
can lead to trial results being less generalizable 
to groups who would potentially benefit from the 
findings, despite them often being groups with 
the highest burden from a particular disease or 
condition. This weakness has impeded the quality of 
available evidence for decision-making, leaving huge 
uncertainties related to care and inequitable access 
to interventions. It can also reduce the willingness 
of people in those under-represented groups to 
accept treatment recommendations based on a trial’s 
findings.
Finally, although patient and community 
engagement in clinical trials has improved, there 
remains a lack of broadly applicable disease-
agnostic standard practice for such involvement. 
This inadequacy can lead to inappropriate trial 
design and implementation, mistrust in research, 
and failure of clinical trials to start, reach completion 
or produce results meaningful to the populations 
they are intended to serve.1.5 Steps required to improve 
evidence generation
The above issues urgently need to be addressed 
to advance global public health. This requires 
identification of relevant research questions, 
proportionate design and conduct of clinical trials 
and strengthening of the global clinical trials 
environment, or “ecosystem” .
1.5.1	 Identification	 of	a	relevant	 research	
question
A prerequisite for conducting a good clinical trial 
is identification of an important and relevant 
research question, the answers to which will fill 
gaps in evidence to inform research priority setting. 
Clinical trials should principally focus on public 
health and disease areas of national and global 
priority and address questions that are clinically 
pertinent to the communities and populations 
affected by them; at the same time, they should 
consider epidemiological trends to address potential 
(and future) health threats. It is vital not only to 
identify a relevant question but also to ascertain if 
it has already been robustly answered. This can be 
facilitated by conducting and reporting systematic 
reviews (for example, according to the guidelines on 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) (41)) as part of clinical trial 
planning. Such reviews comprehensively evaluate 
and synthesize available evidence, and as such can 
consolidate existing knowledge and improve future 
clinical trials by providing insights into the strengths 
and limitations of prior studies, as well as guide the 
selection of interventions and outcome measures. 
By conducting a systematic review researchers can 
prevent unnecessary duplication and minimize 
research waste (42, 43) , and such reviews should be 
promoted by funders and seen as complementary 
to clinical trials. However, it should also be borne in 
mind that systematic reviews may be subject to bias, 
either because trials with more promising results are 
more likely to be published and known about than 
those with less promising results or because such 
reviews may under-represent certain populations 
if the existing evidence is not relevant to them (for 
example, trials in LMICs may not be prominent owing 
to research having historically been done in HICs).  

9
1. IntroductionTherefore, additional measures (such as policy gap 
analysis) may also need to be considered as part of 
the process of identification of a relevant research 
question. Such reviews should include both available 
evidence from clinical trial results and review of 
ongoing research available in clinical trial registries 
such as the primary registries from International 
Clinical Trials Registration Platform (ICTRP) (44) and 
ClinicalTrials.gov  (45).
1.5.2	 Efficient	and	risk-proportionate	
design and conduct of clinical 
trials
Clinical trial quality can be defined as fitness for 
purpose, where the purpose is to provide reliable 
results of sufficient robustness to enable informed 
decision-making based on the trial outcomes. 
Attributes of clinical trial quality include good trial 
design, conduct and appropriate analysis. 
One area identified as a potential barrier to clinical 
trials has been over-interpretation of existing 
regulations and guidance for clinical trials. A frequent 
consequence has been excessive bureaucracy, which 
has also resulted in unnecessarily onerous and 
disproportionate trial procedures, with, for example, 
even minor trial processes or trial staff changes 
(which do not materially affect the reliability or safety 
of a trial) often requiring extensive documentation for 
no benefit. This lack of proportionality has sometimes 
had the adverse consequence of reducing rather 
than improving the number of reliably informative 
trials across a range of settings. 
Instead, trial “quality” should focus on good design 
and processes that assure the absence of errors 
that matter to decision-making – that is, errors that 
have a meaningful impact on the safety of trial 
participants or credibility of the results (and thereby 
the care of future patients) – and not be confused 
with the volume of paperwork (including collecting 
and filing documents), the length of clinical trial protocols and other documentation (46). Crucially, 
trial processes should be proportionate to their 
context and any associated risks, with efficient 
implementation. Streamlining and quality are not 
opposed. Enabling such an approach need not 
compromise the robustness of the data generated 
to answer relevant scientific questions; rather it can 
substantially enhance available evidence from high-
quality clinical trials and hence population health 
worldwide. 
Section 2  of this document provides high-level 
guidance for clinical trial design and conduct  with 
a focus on the key scientific and ethical features that 
should be universal to all clinical trials in order to 
enable them to produce reliably informative, high-
quality evidence relevant for informing national 
and international guidelines and decision-making, 
regardless of context. A proportionate approach 
focusing on the main considerations and what 
really matters can enable more good quality trials 
to be conducted.
1.5.3 Strengthening of the global clinical 
trial ecosystem
For clinical trials to achieve their intended aims, 
measures must be taken to enhance the capabilities 
to conduct relevant trials globally. This requires: 
action by not only those designing and conducting 
clinical trials but also all parties involved in 
prioritizing, funding, approving and overseeing 
clinical trials; investment in and availability of 
clinical trial infrastructure globally; and efficient 
communication between all those involved. Crucially, 
patients and communities should be seen as a key 
part of the clinical trials ecosystem and involved at 
all stages of the lifecycle of a clinical trial.
Section 3  of this document provides high-level 
guidance and recommendations on best practices 
for the strengthening of the ecosystem for clinical 
trials, including enabling actions.

12Reliably informative, ethical and efficient clinical 
trials (”good” trials) need to address the following 
five key points which capture the necessary 
qualities of a well-planned, well-run and clinically 
relevant trial. They should:
• be designed to produce scientifically-sound 
answers to relevant questions 
• respect the rights and well-being of 
participants 
• be collaborative and transparent 
• be designed to be feasible for their context
• manage trial quality effectively and efficiently. 
The methods and approaches needed to apply 
these qualities will differ in small or large ways from 
trial to trial, but their validity is universal.
2.1 Good clinical trials are 
designed to produce 
scientifically	sound	answers	to	
relevant questions 
Clinical trials should help to resolve important 
uncertainties about effects of health interventions. 
Depending on the context, the results may be needed 
to determine whether to proceed with development 
or further evaluation of the intervention or to inform 
regulatory licensing, clinical guidelines and/or health 
policy. In each case, relevant uncertainties applying 
to the specific question(s) that remain at the end 
of the trial should be sufficiently small to allow 
meaningful decisions to be made.
As indicated in Section 1.2 , most health interventions 
only have moderate effects, and clinical trials 
intended to reliably ascertain such effects 2.	Key	scientific	and	ethical	
considerations for clinical trials
typically require clinical trials with the following 
features: randomization without foreknowledge 
of intervention allocation so as to ensure that any 
differences in health outcomes observed between 
the randomized groups are due to either the effect 
of the study intervention or the play of chance (that 
is, control for systematic errors), as well as blinding/
masking of allocated trial intervention (where 
feasible) to further minimize bias. 
2.1.1 Robust intervention allocation
Key message. Randomization requires generation 
of an unpredictable allocation schedule with 
concealment of the intervention to which a particular 
participant has been allocated until after the point 
of randomization. It should be impossible to predict 
in advance to which study intervention an individual 
trial participant or individual cluster (for instance, 
hospital or city in a cluster clinical trial) is likely to be 
allocated, so that investigators, health care providers 
and other staff involved and potential participants 
are not aware of which intervention to which they 
will be assigned. 
Why this is important. Randomization allows for like-
with-like comparisons so that subsequent differences 
in health outcomes between the groups (beneficial 
or adverse) are due either to the play of chance or 
causally to differences in the study intervention. 
The absence of adequate concealment of allocation 
before randomization can lead to selection bias 
(that is, the decision to enter a particular participant 
in a trial can be influenced by knowledge of which 
intervention they are likely to be assigned to).
2.1.2	 Blinding/masking	of 	allocated	trial

Key message. Knowledge of the allocated trial 
intervention may influence the behaviour of 
participants, those who care for them, and those 

13
2. Key scientific and ethical considerations for clinical trialsassessing study outcomes (particularly if these are 
subjective in nature). These problems can be avoided 
through use of placebo medications or dummy 
interventions and by ensuring that those individuals 
or systems responsible for assessing participant 
outcomes, as well as all who are responsible for 
care of participants, are unaware of the intervention 
allocation. 
Why this is important. In many clinical trials, 
knowledge of the allocated intervention can 
influence the nature and intensity of clinical 
management, the reporting of symptoms or the 
assessment of functional status or clinical outcomes, 
introducing bias. Where feasible, masking (or 
blinding) participants, investigators, health care 
providers, and those assessing outcomes to the 
assigned intervention through use of placebo 
medications or dummy interventions can help to 
prevent such issues, as can the use of information 
that is recorded separately from the clinical trial (for 
instance, in routine clinical databases and disease 
registries). These considerations are important for 
the assessment of both the efficacy and the safety 
of the intervention, including processes relating 
to adjudication of outcomes and considerations of 
whether an individual health event is believed to 
have been caused by the intervention. If blinding 
of an allocated trial intervention is not feasible 
(for example in trials of different types of patient 
management or surgical procedures), blinded or 
masked outcome assessment should be pursued 
for objectively determined outcomes, for example 
through use of a prospective randomized open-label 
blinded endpoint (PROBE) design (see also Section 
2.1.9  ascertainment of outcomes).
All good clinical trials should include the features set 
out in sections 2.1.3–2.1.12.
2.1.3 Appropriate trial population 
Clinical trials often exclude populations that 
the intervention may well benefit, sometimes 
precluding access to certain interventions for the 
populations excluded from the trials.
Key messages. The eligibility criteria should be 
tailored to the question that the trial sets out to 
answer. Inclusion criteria should not be unnecessarily restrictive. Efforts should be made to include a 
broad and varied population (for example, with 
appropriate balance of sex/gender, age, race/ethnic 
and socioeconomic diversity), unless there is a good 
medical or scientific justification for doing otherwise. 
Exclusion criteria should be focused on identifying 
individuals for whom participation would place them 
at undue risk by comparison with any potential 
benefits (for example, based on their medical history 
or concomitant medication), for whom the benefits 
have already been reliably demonstrated, or for 
whom the intervention is not relevant. 
Why this is important. Inclusive eligibility criteria 
increase the relevance and generalizability of the 
findings. They may sometimes allow assessment 
of whether there is good evidence of material 
differences in the effects (beneficial or adverse) 
and/or acceptability of an intervention or its 
delivery in any particular subgroup (for example, 
based on specific genetic, demographic or health 
characteristics), even though statistical power to 
detect whether such differences exist may be limited. 
Populations should not be excluded based solely 
on an argument of potentially insufficient statistical 
power to detect subgroup specific effects. 
Guidance has been developed to improve inclusion 
of underrepresented groups (47–50) . Decentralized 
or point-of-care trials may help to increase the 
diversity of clinical trial enrolment by increasing 
trial accessibility. In addition, diversification of trial 
staff can help to improve community engagement 
and diversification of recruited clinical trial 
populations  (51). 
Specific examples of populations that have typically 
been excluded from clinical trials (either explicitly or 
by implicit exclusion) include pregnant and lactating 
women, infants and children, and older adults. This 
practice has been hugely detrimental and such 
people should be eligible for trial enrolment unless 
a valid justification is provided for their exclusion 
(for example, if there is a serious safety concern or 
a contraindication to a certain intervention or if 
they are at very low risk of the health issue the trial 
seeks to address). Some ways to foster enablement 
of clinical trials in two specific groups are outlined 
below in subsections (a) and (b).  Recommendations 

Guidance for best practices for clinical trials14
Guidance for best practices for clinical trialsrelated to inclusion of older adults, another important 
frequently-excluded group, are contained in Annex 2 . 
(a)	Enabling	clinical	trials	in	pregnant	and	
lactating	women	and	women	of 	child-
bearing age
Demand for facilitation of inclusion of pregnant and 
lactating women (52) and women of child-bearing 
age in clinical trials is growing. Their participation 
requires consideration of the specific barriers they 
may face to enrolment, owing to not only the 
incorrect perception that this is a default ethical or 
scientific position but also practical issues. Some 
of these potential barriers, such as limited literacy 
to provide informed consent and legal restrictions 
(for example, third party consent requirements), 
are common to many populations, whereas others 
are more prevalent in women, such as the need 
for child-care provision and, particularly in some 
regions, mobility restrictions. Many clinical trials 
could enable recruitment of pregnant and lactating 
women by assessing pre-existing evidence for the 
safe use of the same or similar intervention in this 
population, such as its use for a different clinical 
indication. Due consideration should be given to the 
severity of the condition for which the intervention 
is intended in this population, and the potential 
for improved outcomes in both the recipients and 
their offspring. For trials of novel interventions for 
maternal disease where there is no pre-existing 
evidence of use of the same or similar interventions 
in this population, preclinical reproductive toxicology 
studies should be reviewed to guide decision-
making. Where maternal disease is severe, maternal 
and pregnancy outcomes are expected to be poor 
and reproductive toxicology studies are reassuring, 
benefits to women of inclusion in a trial are likely to 
outweigh any potential risks. For diseases with high 
fatality for which no alternative interventions are 
available, reproductive-toxicity studies should be 
expedited, and pregnant individuals included as far 
as possible in clinical trials of new interventions.  In 
several therapeutic areas, practical ways to accelerate 
investigation of new interventions in pregnant and 
lactating women have been developed, with calls to 
action involving multiple stakeholders. There is now 
ethical guidance for the inclusion of pregnant women 
in the development of vaccines against emerging 
pathogens, and subsequent vaccination programmes 
as well as for advancing research into HIV and co‐infections in pregnant women (53, 54) . An ICH 
guideline (E21) is also currently in development for 
inclusion of pregnant and lactating women in clinical 
trials (55). Excretion of a drug or its metabolites into 
human milk should be examined where applicable 
and feasible, and offspring of breastfeeding women 
enrolled into clinical trials monitored for any effects 
of an intervention (6).
(b)	Enabling	paediatric	clinical	trials	
Children should not be an afterthought in clinical 
development programmes but considered from the 
outset (56), with inclusion as early as possible in clinical 
trials of interventions of potential benefit to them. 
Wherever possible, extrapolation of adult efficacy and 
safety data to children should be considered. Use of 
age-agnostic trial enrolment and standardized weight-
band dosing for children, with parallel enrolment of 
all children across all weight bands, should also be 
considered, potentially coupled with enrolment by 
development stage. Such an approach could mitigate 
against enrolment of children being done in an age-
stratified way (that is, starting with older children), 
which disadvantages younger patients. Development 
of appropriate paediatric interventions should be 
prioritized with attention given to factors such as 
palatability of formulations, flexibility for weight-
based dosing and stability for use in a wide range 
of geographical locations. Use of pharmacometric 
modelling and simulation techniques (such as 
creation of synthetic control arms) may help to 
improve the design of some paediatric trials. Several 
initiatives are underway to enable paediatric clinical 
trials. In particular, in 2016, the World Health Assembly 
adopted resolution  WHA69.20 on promoting 
innovation and access to quality, safe, efficacious and 
affordable medicines for children (57). WHO and other 
stakeholders have joined forces to accelerate access 
to effective paediatric diagnostics and medicines, 
notably for HIV infection and tuberculosis (58–60) , and 
the Global Accelerator for Paediatric Formulations 
Network (GAP-f) (61) was created to build on and 
formalize the model developed within the HIV 
community to provide a sustainable mechanism to 
ensure that safer, more effective and more durable 
paediatric formulations are developed and made 
available to children against an accelerated timeline. 
Measures such as the FDA Paediatric Research Equity 
Act (62) and EU Paediatric Regulation (63) have also 
enabled trials in this population.

15
2. Key scientific and ethical considerations for clinical trialsThe use of global networks may further enable 
clinical trial participation in such populations. For 
example, the Global Network for Women’s and 
Children’s Health Research (64) is a partnership 
dedicated to improving maternal and child health 
outcomes and building health research capacity 
in resource-poor settings by testing cost-effective, 
sustainable interventions that provide guidance for 
the practice of evidence-based medicine.
2.1.4 Adequate size 
Key message. A clinical trial should be sufficiently 
sized and statistically powered to provide a robust 
answer to the question it sets out to address. 
Why this is important. For the effects of health 
care interventions to be reliably detected or 
reliably refuted, random errors must be small by 
comparison with the expected size of the effect 
of the intervention. The best way to minimize the 
impact of random errors is to study sufficiently large 
numbers of participants who will develop the health 
outcome that the intervention is intended to prevent 
or treat (noting that clinical trials assessing impact 
on discrete health outcomes such as mortality will 
require more participants than those assessing 
impact on continuous measures such as laboratory 
results as is often the case in early-phase trials) (65).
Trials in early stages of drug development (for example, 
first-in-human trials) have a specific objective for 
which a smaller size is typically appropriate. In some 
scenarios it is challenging to enrol large numbers of 
participants, such as trials assessing interventions 
for rare diseases. For such trials, it may be helpful 
to contribute to a broader collaboration to conduct 
them, through large, multicentre clinical trials, or to 
select a clinically relevant outcome for which the 
effect size is expected to be larger (for example, 
a clinically validated physiological or imaging 
biomarker). It may be possible to reduce the impact 
of random errors through statistical analyses or by 
making assessments at a time when the effects of 
the intervention are expected to be greatest. Use of 
alternative study designs to facilitate recruitment 
(such as point-of-care and decentralized trials) may 
help to ensure adequate trial size. Meta-analysis 
may be particularly helpful when the effects of an 
intervention on an outcome are likely to be moderate and too few cases have occurred in any individual 
trial to assess the effects sufficiently reliably or to 
assess whether there any important differences in 
treatment response between different patient groups 
(21–23) . Use of core outcomes (see Section 2.1.7 ) may 
facilitate prospective meta-analyses. 
2.1.5 Adherence to allocated trial 
intervention 
Key message. Efforts should be made to facilitate and 
encourage adherence to the allocated intervention(s) 
where appropriate and feasible. 
Why this is important. Although there may 
be instances in which it is appropriate for trial 
participants to stop their allocated intervention (for 
example, in the case of a major intolerance), the 
potential ability for the trial to accurately determine 
and quantify the impact of the intervention (whether 
beneficial or harmful) should be carefully considered. 
For RCTs, if trial participants allocated to an active 
intervention do not receive it as planned or if those 
allocated to the control group (for example, placebo 
or usual care) start to receive the active intervention, 
then the contrast between the two study groups 
is lower. Consequently, the ability to assess any 
difference in outcome between the arms of the trial 
is reduced (and a false conclusion that there is no 
meaningful difference between the interventions 
when in fact there is one is more likely). Adherence 
to allocated trial intervention may be facilitated 
through for example, pre-randomization “run-in”  
phases (on placebo or even active intervention) 
and supporting trial participants to continue (for 
example, where feasible, options for remote follow-
up rather than in-person clinic visits).
2.1.6	 Completeness	of 	follow-up	
Key message. Participant outcomes should be 
ascertained for the full duration of the clinical trial, 
regardless of whether a participant continues to 
receive the allocated intervention or ceases to do so 
(because, for instance, of perceived or real adverse 
effects of the intervention), with every effort made to 
proactively minimize the loss of data. In some cases, 
it may also be appropriate to continue follow-up 
for many years after the main analyses have been 
reported.

Guidance for best practices for clinical trials16
Guidance for best practices for clinical trialsWhy this is important. For RCTs, continued follow-
up of all randomized participants (even if some stop 
their assigned intervention) maintains the like-with-
like comparison produced by the randomization 
process. Premature cessation of follow-up or post-
randomization exclusion of participants should 
therefore be avoided as it may introduce systematic 
bias, particularly as the type of people excluded 
from one intervention group may differ from those 
excluded from another. Incomplete follow-up may 
reduce the statistical power of a clinical trial (that is, 
the ability to distinguish any differences in outcome 
between the interventions) and underestimate the 
true effects (benefits or hazards) of the intervention. 
Extended follow-up can allow for detection of 
beneficial or harmful effects of the study intervention 
that may persist or emerge months or years after the 
initial randomized comparison. 
2.1.7 Relevant measures of outcomes, as 
simple as possible
Key message. The outcomes that are assessed in a 
clinical trial need to be relevant to the question being 
addressed and should be as simple as possible. When 
trials are intended to achieve marketing authorization 
or change policy, it is often helpful to discuss the 
choice of trial outcomes with regulators and/or policy-
makers. Use of standardized core outcome sets (that 
is, the minimum outcomes that should be measured 
and reported in all clinical trials of a specific condition, 
reflecting outcomes relevant to decision-makers and 
patients) should be considered for all trials, to enable 
the results of studies being compared, contrasted 
and combined (for example, in later meta-analyses) 
as appropriate. Outcomes may include physiological 
measures, symptom scores, participant-reported 
outcomes (PROMs) (66) (that is, measurement tools 
that patients use to provide information on aspects of 
their health status that are relevant to their quality of 
life, including symptoms, functionality, and physical, 
mental and social health), functional status, clinical 
events or use of health care services. The way in which 
these are assessed should be sufficiently robust and 
interpretable (for example, clinically validated in a 
relevant context, particularly for surrogate outcomes 
given their potential limitations (67)). 
Why this is important. The ways by which the 
consequences of the intervention are measured should be sensitive to the expected effects of the intervention 
and appropriate to the study question, and in general 
should be applicable and clinically or scientifically 
meaningful for the relevant population. The choice 
of outcomes may vary depending on the extent of 
prior knowledge of the effects of the intervention 
(for instance, early trials may assess the effects on 
imaging and laboratory markers whereas later trials 
study the effects on clinical outcomes) or change 
over time according to the changing epidemiology 
of a condition (for example on account of pathogen 
mutation and associated impact on clinical effects). It 
is rarely possible or desirable to assess the full range 
of potential outcomes in a single trial. Instead, there 
should be a focus on providing a robust answer to 
the specific, well-formulated question that can have 
impact on patients and policy. Use of core outcomes 
can both enhance the ability to undertake meaningful 
comparisons as part of evidence synthesis and decrease 
research waste. Several initiatives for the use of core 
outcomes already exist for both disease-agnostic and 
disease-specific outcomes, including the International 
Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (68), 
Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (69), 
Standardized Data Collection for Cardiovascular Trials 
Initiative (70), Standardised Outcomes in Nephrology 
(71), and the International Alliance of Mental Health 
Research Funders’ Common Measures in Mental Health 
Science Initiative (72).
2.1.8	 Proportionate, 	efficient	and	
reliable capture of data
Key messages. Data collection should focus 
on the key aspects needed for assessment and 
interpretation of the trial results as specified in the 
protocol and should not be excessive. The extent 
to which information (for example, on participant 
characteristics, concomitant treatments, clinical 
events and laboratory markers) is detected and 
recorded, and the means and level of detail to which 
this is done, should be tailored to each clinical trial. 
In general, data collection should be kept to the 
simplest level possible to answer the question, and 
collecting non-essential variables should be avoided. 
Tools and methods for data collection, storage, 
exchange and access should enable the trial to be 
conducted as designed, support privacy and security, 
and enable reliable and consistent analyses. Digital 

17
2. Key scientific and ethical considerations for clinical trialstechnology and routine collection of health care data 
can provide alternative or complementary means 
to record information about participants and their 
health at study entry, during the intervention and 
follow-up period, and for many years beyond, where 
available and appropriate. 
Why this is important. The volume, nature and 
level of detail of data collection should be balanced 
against its potential value. Disproportionate data 
collection wastes time and resources. It places an 
unnecessary burden on trial participants and staff, 
distracts attention from those aspects of the trial 
that have greatest consequence for the participants, 
and reduces the scale (number of participants 
and duration of follow-up) of what is achievable 
with available resources. In some trials, it may be 
appropriate to measure some features (for example, 
intermediate biomarkers) in a subset of participants, 
chosen on the basis of baseline characteristics 
or random selection, or at a limited number of 
timepoints. The choice of method used for data 
collection can have an important bearing on trial 
reliability and feasibility. Use of data standards (for 
example, the Clinical Data Interchange Standards 
Consortium Study Data Tabulation Model [CDISC 
SDTM] (73)) can help to ensure data quality and 
data integrity, as well as to facilitate potential meta-
analysis and data sharing. Use of digital technology 
and routinely-collected health care data can improve 
the relevance and completeness of information 
collected (for instance, by reducing loss to follow-
up) as well as reduce the burden on those conducting 
the trial and its participants, provided that the data 
are used appropriately.
2.1.9 Ascertainment of outcomes 
Key message. Processes for ascertaining study 
outcomes should adopt an approach that is not 
influenced by the intervention trial participants 
or randomized groups receive. These measures 
include the frequency and intensity of assessments. 
For RCTs, particular care should be taken to 
ensure that the people assessing, clarifying and 
adjudicating study outcomes are not influenced 
by knowledge of the allocated intervention (that 
is, the outcome assessment is blinded or masked). 
Equally, the methods for acquiring, processing and 
combining sources of information (in order, for example, to define participant characteristics or 
clinical outcomes) should be designed and operated 
without access to information about the intervention 
allocation for individual participants or knowledge of 
the unblinded trial results.
Why this is important. If the methods used to 
assess, clarify or classify outcomes differ between 
the assigned interventions, the results may be biased 
in one direction or other leading to inappropriate 
conclusions about the true effect of the intervention. 
Therefore, the approach used to assess what happens 
to participants should be the same regardless of the 
assigned intervention, and those making judgements 
about the occurrence or nature of these outcomes 
should be unaware of the assigned intervention (or 
features, such as symptoms or laboratory assays, that 
would make it easier to guess the assignment) for 
each participant.
2.1.10 Statistical analysis 
Key messages. The trial should be designed to 
robustly answer a clearly articulated key question 
on which the primary analysis should focus. It is not 
good practice to seek to answer multiple questions 
through secondary analyses, which can often be 
misleading. Trial results should be analysed in 
accordance with the protocol and statistical analysis 
plan, with the latter being developed and clearly 
specified when the protocol is written, and finalized 
at the latest before the study results become known 
(that is, before conduct of any unblinded analyses on 
study outcomes). Any analyses conducted after the 
initial results are known should be clearly identified 
as such (8). For RCTs, the main analyses should 
follow the intention-to-treat principle, meaning 
that outcomes should be compared according to 
the intervention arm to which the participants 
were originally allocated at randomization, 
regardless of whether some of those participants 
subsequently received some or none of the intended 
intervention, and regardless of the extent to which 
the post-randomization follow-up procedures were 
completed. 
Subgroup analyses should be interpreted cautiously, 
with due consideration given to prior understanding 
of disease mechanism, especially if they are not 
prespecified or are multiple in number (whether 

Guidance for best practices for clinical trials18
Guidance for best practices for clinical trialsprespecified or not). In general, any prognostic 
features that are to be used in analyses of intervention 
effects in clinical trials should be irreversibly recorded 
or identified before randomization. Reporting on data 
disaggregated by sex (consistent with the Sex and 
Gender Equity in Research [SAGER] guidelines) (74) 
can be valuable. Any findings should be interpreted 
with respect to other existing evidence and clinical 
context.
Why this is important. A statistical analysis plan 
should be specified before any knowledge of 
the trial results (for example, unblinding of the 
treatment allocation in a RCT) in order to avoid the 
possibility that choices about the analysis approach 
may be biased (8). For RCTs, a particular strength is 
the existence of a randomized control group with 
which to compare the incidence of all health events. 
Consequently, it is possible to distinguish those 
events that are causally impacted by allocation to 
the intervention from those that are part of the 
background health of the participants. Analysing 
all participants according to the intervention to 
which they were originally allocated (“intention-
to-treat” analysis) is important because, even in a 
properly randomized trial, bias can be inadvertently 
introduced by the post-randomization removal of 
certain individuals from analyses (such as those who 
are found later not to meet the eligibility criteria, who 
do not adhere to their allocated study treatment or 
who commence an active intervention having been 
allocated to a control group) if the reason for removal 
might have been influenced by the treatment 
allocation. Additional analyses can also be reported; 
for example, when the frequency of a specific side-
effect is being described, it may be justifiable to 
analyse its incidence only among those who received 
the active intervention, because randomized 
comparisons may not be needed to assess large 
effects. However, in assessing moderate effects of the 
treatment, “on-treatment” or “per protocol” analyses 
can be misleading, and intention-to-treat analyses 
are generally more trustworthy for assessing whether 
there is any real difference between the allocated trial 
interventions in their effects. 
One of the most important sources of bias in the 
analysis is undue concentration on just part of 
the evidence (such as selective emphasis on the 
result in one subgroup or subsidiary outcome out of many that is defined after consideration 
of the data). Apparent differences between the 
therapeutic effects in different subgroups of study 
participants can often be produced solely by the 
play of chance. Subgroups therefore need to be 
relevant, prespecified and limited in number. Analysis 
of results in subgroups determined by characteristics 
observed after randomization should be avoided 
because, if the recorded value of some feature is 
(or could be) affected by the trial intervention, then 
comparisons within subgroups that are defined 
by that factor might be biased. It is important to 
interpret results in specific subgroups (for example 
men and women) cautiously and consider whether 
they are consistent with the overall result. Failure to 
do so can lead to people in those subgroups being 
treated inappropriately (given an intervention that is 
ineffective or harmful) or untreated inappropriately 
(not being given an intervention that would benefit 
them) when there is no good evidence that the effect 
varies between them. Although a sound statistical 
approach is critical in clinical research, it is equally 
important to focus on the clinical magnitude and 
relevance of any effect size rather than solely its 
statistical significance (75–78) , as well as any new 
findings in the context of previous findings (for 
example, using the Grading of Recommendations 
Assessment, Development and Evaluation [GRADE] 
approach (79)).
2.1.11	Assessing	beneficial	and	harmful	
effects of the intervention
Key messages. Data generated during the course of 
conducting a clinical trial may reveal new information 
about the effects of the intervention which is 
sufficiently clear that it necessitates alteration of the 
ways in which the trial is conducted and participants 
are cared for or which is sufficiently compelling as 
to warrant a change in the use of the intervention 
both within and outside the trial. Potential harms 
of the intervention should be considered alongside 
potential benefits and in the wider clinical and health 
contexts. 
Why this is important. Not every health event 
that happens in a trial is caused by one of the 
interventions; individuals involved in a trial may 
suffer health events that have nothing to do with 
the trial or the interventions being studied. (The less 

19
2. Key scientific and ethical considerations for clinical trialshealthy the participants in the trial, the more likely 
that any health event is related to factors other than 
the intervention.)
Assessing whether signals (for example, rates 
of clinical events or laboratory abnormalities) 
seen among those allocated to receive a health 
intervention are significantly more or less frequent 
than in a control group (where applicable) provides a 
reliable assessment of the impact of the intervention. 
It provides a fair assessment of which events are 
causally impacted by allocation to the intervention 
compared with those that are part of the background 
health of the participants. In an ongoing trial, such 
unblinded comparisons should be conducted by a 
group (such as a data monitoring committee, also 
known as a data and safety monitoring board) that is 
independent (or protected by a firewall) from the trial 
team to avoid prematurely unblinding the emerging 
results to those involved in running the trial.
By contrast, reports of individual events that are 
believed (for instance, by the participant or a doctor) 
to be caused by the intervention are much less 
informative, owing to the lack of a comparison with 
the incidence of the event in any control group and 
the inherently imprecise judgement of causality. 
The exceptions are events that are rare in the types 
of people involved in the trial but known to be 
potentially strongly associated with particular 
interventions (for example, anaphylaxis or bone 
marrow failure in association with medicines), 
which can be viewed as events of special interest for 
reporting and analysis. Depending on the type of trial, 
the degree of knowledge of the intervention(s) and 
the population in which they are being studied, the 
protocol may specify certain events that require, or 
indeed do not require, to be collected and recorded. 
Equally it may specify which recorded events might 
be expected to occur in the population of interest 
and hence which may not require reporting in an 
expedited manner. 
Effects of health interventions may differ (they may 
be harmful or beneficial) and follow different time 
courses, and may occur at different frequencies and in 
particular groups of individuals. Some interventions 
(such as surgery or chemotherapy) may be associated 
with little or even a hazardous effect in the short-term 
but provide longer-term benefit. It should also be recognized that for many interventions the benefits 
may not be apparent on an individual basis, such as 
where a detrimental outcome has been prevented 
(for example, a stroke or infection). 
2.1.12 Monitoring emerging information 
on	benefits	and	harms	
Key messages. An independent data monitoring 
committee provides a robust means to evaluate 
safety and efficacy data from an ongoing trial, 
including for RCTs unblinded comparisons of the 
frequency of particular events, without prematurely 
unblinding any others involved in the design, 
conduct or governance of the trial. For many clinical 
trials, particularly in early-phase trials, the functions 
of a data monitoring committee could be provided 
internally from the entity running the trial, but 
those involved should nonetheless be rendered 
independent by being adequately protected by a 
firewall from the trial team to ensure that awareness 
of results does not introduce bias (or the perception 
of bias). Use of a charter that details the structure and 
organization of the data monitoring committee can 
promote transparency and facilitate such committees 
to operate more effectively. Some trials may not 
require a data monitoring committee (for example, 
if the trial is short-term and would not be modified 
regardless of interim data), although they may still 
benefit from some form of independent oversight.
A data management committee (DMC) should 
include members with relevant skills to understand 
and interpret the emerging safety and efficacy data, 
and where appropriate take into consideration 
patient and public perspectives. A DMC should 
review analyses of the emerging data, unblinded 
to any randomized intervention group so as to be 
able to make informed decisions given knowledge 
about the potential adverse effects of a specific 
treatment (which would not be possible if they were 
not unblinded). The DMC should advise the trial 
organizers when there is clear evidence to suggest 
a change in the protocol or procedures, including 
cessation of one or more aspects of the trial. Such 
changes may be due to evidence of benefit or harm 
or futility (where continuing the trial is unlikely to 
provide any meaningful new information). In making 
such recommendations, a DMC should take account 
of both the unblinded analyses of the trial results and 

Guidance for best practices for clinical trials20
Guidance for best practices for clinical trialsinformation available from other sources (including 
publications from other trials).
Why this is important. All those involved in the 
design, conduct and oversight of an ongoing 
trial should remain unaware of the interim results 
until after the conclusion of the study so as not to 
introduce bias into the results (as in the case, for 
example, of stopping the trial early when the results 
happen by chance to look favourable or adverse). 
The requirement for, and timing and nature of, any 
interim analyses should be carefully considered so 
as not to risk premature decision-making based on 
limited data.
2.2 Good clinical trials respect 
the	rights	and	well-being	of 	
participants
Ethical clinical trials (12–14)  combine the search 
for answers to important questions with scientific 
validity and appropriate protection and respect for 
all involved, particularly participants. Independent 
review of proposals for new research, through an 
institutional review board (IRB), research ethics 
committee (REC) or equivalent is an important 
governance tool and can help to ensure appropriate 
steps are taken to protect the rights and welfare of 
participants.
2.2.1	 Appropriate	communication	with	
participants
Key message. At all stages of a clinical trial (before, 
during and after), relevant, easily-understandable 
information should be shared with trial participants 
(or, where applicable, their legal representatives), 
with a careful balance of the duty to inform against 
the risk of information saturation and account being 
taken of the clinical context. Information should 
be provided in a clear manner and in suitable 
languages and formats for the intended audiences. 
Co-developing and piloting such clinical trial 
information with target populations is valuable. 
The most important information for participants’  
decision-making should be clearly highlighted 
and excessive length of information materials and 
consent forms should be avoided.Why this is important. Providing timely and relevant 
information to participants during a trial facilitates 
ethical research with benefits to both the participants 
and the quality of the trial results. It is essential 
that potential or recruited trial participants are 
appropriately informed, but presenting excessive or 
exhaustive detail can work against this objective by 
overwhelming, confusing or disconcerting potential 
participants. Care should be taken to communicate 
effectively and enable relevant discussion, taking 
into account accessibility (for example, to those 
who are illiterate). In some circumstances it can 
be helpful to provide information in visual, audio, 
animated or interactive computer-based formats. 
The exact approach may be influenced by the 
context of the research, including clinical, cultural 
or other issues. At the end of the trial, the key results 
should be made available to participants in a form 
that is accessible and understandable. As specified 
in Section 2.3.1,  the development of clinical trial 
information in partnership with patients, the public 
and communities can facilitate the inclusion of 
diverse populations.
2.2.2 Relevant consent 
Key messages. The trial consent process should 
clearly explain to potential trial participants (or, 
where applicable, their legal representatives) the 
reasons why the trial is being done, the questions it 
is seeking to answer, what is involved for them, and 
the potential benefits and risks of participation  (12). 
Where appropriate, this should include an assent 
process for those lacking capacity to give full 
consent such as children and minors (56). The 
extent, nature and timing of information provided 
before and during the informed consent process 
should be guided by the level of additional risks 
and commitment that participation in the trial 
would involve in the context of the usual clinical 
care or circumstances that the same individuals 
would normally receive. The information provided 
should prioritize the needs and expectations of the 
prospective participant rather than those of the 
organization or individuals conducting the trial. 
Consent information should be widely accessible 
and readily understandable (for example, with 
respect to readability), avoid legalistic or other 
technical language, and be as succinct as possible.  
Approaches to obtaining and maintaining ongoing 

21
2. Key scientific and ethical considerations for clinical trialsconsent and communication should be relevant to 
the trial it relates to, with due consideration given to 
cultural and community contexts. Where appropriate, 
electronic consent mechanisms may be used (80). The 
consent process should facilitate optimal use of data 
where possible through inclusion of wording that 
allows for appropriate and relevant future application 
of data or for use of biological samples in research 
(13). Where co-enrolment in another clinical trial is 
not possible this should be scientifically justified. 
Where payment for clinical trial participation is 
offered, this should also be explained and justified. 
Conversely reimbursement for costs incurred by 
participants is a broadly accepted practice in many 
contexts and should be distinguished from payments 
to participate.
Why this is important. Consent is valid if it is 
informed, voluntary and competently given before 
entry into a trial. There are some situations in which 
an individual cannot give informed consent (for 
example, for infants, minors or individuals lacking 
decision-making capacity, in which case consent 
should be obtained from the participant’s guardian 
or legally authorized representative) or it is not 
practical to do so because of the urgency of the 
medical situation (for example, in cases of trauma or 
medical emergencies, in which case consent should 
be sought later in the trial if and whenever the 
participant recovers the capacity to consent or from 
their guardian or legally authorized representative 
once they are available). For some trials and in 
some individual situations, explicit consent may 
be modified or waived (14). In such cases, there 
should be minimal additional risks and burdens 
to participation in comparison to the usual care a 
prospective participant might receive outside the 
trial. Waivers or modifications of informed consent 
may also be necessary in some clinical trials in which 
the intervention is directed at an entire community 
(cluster randomized trials), making it impossible 
to avoid the intervention. Such situations should 
not automatically preclude the conduct of clinical 
trials (which may be the only way to provide reliable 
information on how best to manage such health 
issues) but appropriate safeguards should be put 
in place to maintain the rights of the individuals 
who participate. Electronic consent processes may 
improve trial efficiency (for example, to facilitate 
decentralized approaches or point-of-care designs). Data from clinical trials should also be used to 
optimal efficiency to minimize potential waste of 
research resources. Being in one clinical trial should 
not necessarily automatically preclude being in 
another. Similarly, based upon the principle of clinical 
equipoise, participation in a clinical trial should not 
unduly penalize trial participants seeking insurance 
(for example, travel or medical) without a firm 
scientific rationale for this to be the case. Although 
it can be justifiable to reimburse those taking part 
in clinical trials for their time and commitment, care 
should be taken to ensure careful balance against 
undue influence.
2.2.3 Changing consent
Key message. Participants should be free to stop 
or change the nature of their participation without 
affecting the usual care received. Where possible 
and acceptable to the participant, efforts should be 
made to determine the intended meaning of such 
individual decisions and to explain the potential 
impact of any such decisions.
Why this is important. It is the right of participants 
to change their mind about whether they wish to 
continue in the trial at any point, but it should be 
noted that the term “withdrawal” can mean different 
things to different people. The meaning can range 
from wanting to stop receiving the study intervention 
to stopping attending study visits in person (but 
perhaps be happy to be contacted or for information 
about their health outcomes to be collected from 
their regular doctors or from routine health data 
systems) to having their biological samples no 
longer assayed or stored or their data no longer 
being processed or shared. Therefore, it is clearer 
to avoid the term and instead try to clarify with the 
participant(s) what level of participation they want 
to have and what they want to cease. If this is not 
properly explored and the withdrawal is interpreted 
with prejudice to mean complete removal from 
the study, trial participants may be unnecessarily 
and inadvertently lost to full or partial follow-up, 
with possible implications for the reliability of trial 
findings, and may miss out on aspects of the clinical 
trial that matter to them (such as attendance at study 
visits or being informed about progress and results 
of the study).

Guidance for best practices for clinical trials22
Guidance for best practices for clinical trials2.2.4 Implications of changing consent
Key message. The rights of an individual participant 
to change or withdraw consent for use of trial data 
should be balanced against scientific and ethical 
requirements. 
Why this is important. Removing data can result in 
unreliable or inconclusive findings, with ethical and 
clinical safety consequences for both participants 
continuing in the trial and the care of future patients. 
(For example, important safety signals may be 
missed.) It can be appropriate to make data that 
have already been collected available for analysis in 
order to demonstrate or preserve research integrity. 
Those involved in a trial and those whose care may 
be influenced by its results should be able to be 
assured that the data are valid and that they have 
not been modified through inadvertent, deliberate 
or malicious means. 
2.2.5 Managing the safety of individual 
participants in the clinical trial
Key messages. Detection and management of safety 
of trial participants should be tailored to the trial 
population and to what is already known about the 
intervention. Such approaches may be modified as 
new information emerges (for example, from other 
trials or clinical studies in the relevant population). 
In some circumstances it may be appropriate to 
exclude some groups of individuals from a trial if 
the likely risk to their health is excessive (compared 
with potential gain) and cannot be mitigated by 
reasonable clinical strategies. For some blinded 
trials, there may be occasions when knowledge 
of the allocated intervention for an individual 
participant could materially influence the immediate 
medical management of the participant. In such 
circumstances, it should be possible for the treatment 
allocation to be unblinded and disclosed to the 
relevant medical team without delay. 
Why this is important. The procedures used to detect, 
investigate and respond to unwanted health events 
for individual participants should be shaped by what 
is already known about the effects of the intervention 
from previous research or usage, as well as the 
background epidemiological and clinical features of the intended trial population (for example, their 
demographics, comorbidities and any concomitant 
intervention). If new information emerges during the 
course of the trial (for example, from other studies 
or as a consequence of advice provided by a trial’s 
data monitoring committee) then processes and 
procedures for managing the safety of individual 
participants should be reviewed and may need to 
be modified (for example, by changing the nature 
and timing of assessments, providing training to 
trial staff, providing information to participants or 
amending the eligibility criteria for the trial). 
2.2.6	 Communication	of 	new	
information relevant to the 
intervention
Key message. During an ongoing trial, new 
information may become available (from within the 
trial or external sources) that materially changes 
what is known about the effects of the intervention 
for some or all participants. This information should 
be communicated to those involved in overseeing, 
conducting or participating in the clinical trial for 
whom it is relevant (for example, because it might 
affect their understanding of the intervention or 
because they are required to take some action). Such 
communications and reports should be informative, 
timely and actionable. 
Why this is important. Excessive, irrelevant or 
uninformative reports (particularly of individual 
cases) distract attention from those that require 
action. It is often preferable to produce and circulate 
contextualized periodic updates that are focused 
on safety issues that matter. Such reports may also 
be provided to the data monitoring committee 
(for consideration in the context of the unblinded 
emerging trial data) and to regulatory bodies (for 
consideration of the implications for participants in 
other trials and for the wider group of patients and 
public). The distribution of reports should be in a 
format and timing that is commensurate with the 
action that is likely to be needed and the audience 
for which it is intended (for example, participants, 
clinicians and regulators).

23
2. Key scientific and ethical considerations for clinical trials2.3 Good clinical trials are 
collaborative and transparent
All those involved in clinical trials share responsibility 
for building and sustaining the trust of collaborating 
partner organizations and clinical communities, 
participants and the wider public. Trust is undermined 
when clinical trials are not sufficiently relevant, fair, 
transparent and respectful of the rights, interests, 
concerns and values of all involved (especially those 
people who participate in them or whose care will 
be influenced by the results).
2.3.1	 Working	in	partnership	with	
people and communities
Key message. Potential participants and/or 
members of the relevant community provide 
valuable contributions to the design, execution and 
interpretation of the results of clinical trials. 
Why this is important. The early involvement of a 
diverse range of patients and relevant members of 
the public can play a key role in: defining, refining 
and prioritizing research questions; assessing 
and increasing the acceptability and feasibility 
of the trial (81); selecting trial interventions and 
outcomes that are relevant and meaningful to the 
intended population; developing the trial design 
and procedures; optimizing the nature and delivery 
of information; and encouraging dialogue about 
access to health care interventions that prove 
effective. Working in partnership with people 
and communities is likely to increase trust and 
confidence while decreasing the risk of important 
groups being excluded or the needs of local 
populations or sectors being overlooked or 
misunderstood.  All relevant stakeholders should 
have the opportunity to learn, raise concerns and 
provide input into planning and implementation. To 
ensure broad representation, efforts should be made 
to ensure appropriate diversity in any such patient 
and community involvement.
2.3.2 Collaboration among 
organizations
Key message. It is important that interactions 
between individuals in different organizations 
involved in clinical trials, including those in resource-rich and resource-limited settings and among 
commercial, academic and health care sectors, are 
fair and respectful of the interests, concerns and 
values of all involved, including trial participants and 
the communities from which they come. Working 
collaboratively with partners and networks (whether 
local, national or international) (see Section 3.2.2 ) to 
consider which features of a clinical trial are critical to 
its quality and supporting a delivery approach that is 
appropriate to the setting and context can enhance 
a trial’s resilience and efficiency.
Why this is important. Collaborative working leads 
to the sharing of ideas and expertise, helps to avoid 
misaligned approaches or substantially different 
priorities, and can build capacity, maximize use of 
resources and increase efficiency.
2.3.3 Transparency 
Key messages. Clinical trials should adopt an 
“open science” approach wherever possible. This 
encompasses transparency being fostered in 
numerous aspects of clinical trials:
• Registration. Clinical trials should be registered 
from the outset on a  publicly-available registry 
of clinical trials (for example, the WHO registry 
network (44)) in accordance with the WMA 
Declaration of Helsinki (12). Where trial registries 
allow, they also should be updated with trial 
outcomes in a timely manner, even if the trial 
was stopped prematurely or did not meet its 
objective(s).  
• Trial materials.  Making other information 
about a trial (including its protocol and other 
documentation such as the statistical analysis 
plan) publicly available is strongly encouraged. 
• Trial reports.  Once the trial is completed, reports 
should be made available in a timely manner on 
a publicly available clinical trial registry and/or 
in a peer-reviewed journal (typically within 12 
months but sooner, for instance, as a preprint, 
in public health emergencies) and should 
comprehensively describe the study design, 
methods and results in a clear and transparent 
manner, regardless of the trial’s findings (82). 
Negative findings are as important to report 

Guidance for best practices for clinical trials24
Guidance for best practices for clinical trialsas positive ones. Trials should be reported 
following established guidelines where possible 
(for example, the Consolidated Standards of 
Reporting Trials [CONSORT] guidelines for 
RCTs (83, 84) ) preferably in open-access peer-
reviewed publications in the context of other 
relevant evidence. It can be helpful for reports 
to be available in formats that enable both 
professional and lay readers to understand 
and interpret the results. Reporting results to 
participants and to the public requires different 
approaches from reporting results to the clinical 
and scientific community. 
• Trial funding.  Sources of trial funding as well as 
declarations of any possible conflicts of interest 
by those involved in designing, conducting or 
reporting trials should be easily accessible.
• Data sharing.  This should be enabled at a 
suitable time if ethical, feasible and scientifically 
appropriate, with due consideration given to 
data protection and privacy. A data management 
and sharing plan should be developed in line 
with WHO data-sharing principles (85) of being 
effective, ethical and equitable, as articulated in 
the WHO policy on research data sharing. 
Why this is important. Transparency and sharing 
of knowledge about health care interventions 
help to generate further knowledge, build and 
maintain trust and give confidence to both those 
involved in the trial and those who are not. Trial 
registration  (86) can aid in the identification of gaps 
in clinical trials research, makes researchers and 
potential participants aware of recruiting trials 
(which may facilitate recruitment) and fosters more 
effective collaboration among researchers (including 
conducting prospective meta-analysis), and the 
process may lead to improvements in the quality 
of clinical trials. Timely communication of the trial 
results (regardless of what those findings are) is 
vital to guide future research, reduce unnecessary 
duplication of effort (which wastes resources) and 
enable care to be guided by an up-to-date evidence 
base.  Good communication can also support wider 
efforts to foster potential collaborations and increase 
informed participation in clinical trials. Transparency 
of research communicated in a range of formats 
so as to make them widely accessible to patients, communities and the public is vital to foster public 
confidence about safety, quality and effectiveness 
of interventions and combat misinformation which 
is detrimental to public health. 
2.4 Good clinical trials are 
designed to be feasible for 
their context
Ensuring that a trial is set up to be practicable and 
produce reliable, actionable results is an important 
scientific and ethical duty. Consideration of the 
context and existing resources in a proposed trial 
setting can better ensure effective trial design.
2.4.1 Setting and context
Key message. The design and implementation of 
clinical trials should recognize and be shaped by 
the characteristics of the settings in which they take 
place, including the health needs and preferences 
of communities, their ability to access to health care 
and their understanding of clinical trials, as identified 
through appropriate involvement, consultation and 
engagement with a diverse and inclusive range of 
patients and public. 
Why this is important. These characteristics, 
alongside the nature and complexity of the research, 
are crucial to identification of the ethical issues at 
stake and the issues, burdens and benefits of running 
the trial in that setting. Relevant and accessible 
clinical trials are more likely to recruit a sufficient 
number of trial participants. Good patient and public 
involvement and education across the relevant 
communities help to shape successful recruitment 
and subsequent adoption of the results.
2.4.2 Use of existing resources 
Key messages. Clinical trials should be tailored to 
be practicable given the available infrastructure in 
relevant settings. This planning includes making 
optimal use of pre-existing resources and facilities, 
including the expertise, skills, professional standards 
and quality oversight mechanisms associated with 
routine health care practice while not unduly 
hampering such routine care. All individuals 
involved in performing a trial should be qualified by 

25
2. Key scientific and ethical considerations for clinical trialseducation, training or experience to perform their 
respective task(s), but it should be recognized that 
many aspects of conducting a clinical trial are in 
line with routine care and therefore may not require 
additional training, procedures or checks. Training or 
mentoring the existing local health workforce and 
dedicated researchers are both needed. Training of 
health workforce members to participate in research 
should be differentiated from training of dedicated 
researchers to lead research.
Why this is important. Clinical trials should not 
be wasteful of staff and participants’ time, use of 
interventional or other medical supplies, energy 
or environmental resources. Existing strengths 
and safeguards in routine systems should not be 
duplicated or altered without careful justification. 
The closer trial processes are to routine practice 
(for participants and staff), the more efficiently and 
effectively they are likely to be executed, the fewer 
mistakes are likely to be made, resulting in improved 
quality. 
2.5 Good clinical trials manage 
quality effectively and 
efficiently
The design and conduct of a high-quality trial 
require competent decision-making and coordinated 
execution. Good governance and good trial quality 
management can help to achieve these features.
2.5.1 Good governance
Key message. Clinical trials should be subject 
to sufficient scrutiny to support completion of 
informative, ethical and efficient studies and to avoid, 
correct or mitigate problems.
Why this is important. Effective and efficient 
governance (for example, through a trial steering 
committee) helps to maintain the scientific and 
ethical integrity of a trial and to provide advice on 
appropriate courses of action. It should be structured 
to enable both effective responses to issues that may 
arise, particularly when multiple organizations are 
involved, and reasonably consistent implementation 
across the trial.Membership of trial governance structures should 
reflect the expertise necessary to scrutinize key 
roles, responsibilities and risks, and should build 
on the diverse strengths and capabilities of those 
involved. The need for a member or a component 
of the governance structure to have independence 
from trial sponsorship and management should be 
determined by assessing the risk that judgement and 
advice could be materially influenced (or perceived 
to be influenced) by the relationship. 
Governance approaches should account for the 
opportunity cost of associated activities by 
considering the extent to which they might impede 
participants and communities from benefiting from 
an effective intervention or prolong the time an 
ineffective or hazardous intervention remains in use. 
Prolonged or excessive governance activities, which 
drive up unnecessary costs, deter trial designs of 
sufficient size or duration or discourage clinicians and 
participants from being involved, should be avoided.
2.5.2 Protecting trial integrity
Key message. The integrity of the results of a 
clinical trial should be protected by ensuring that 
decisions about its design, delivery and analysis are 
not influenced by premature access to unblinded 
information about the emerging results. Interim 
analyses of unblinded data on study outcomes 
should not be performed unless prespecified in the 
protocol or statistical analysis plan or conducted by 
the data monitoring committee. 
Why this is important. Unscheduled reviews of 
unblinded data on study outcomes provide an 
unreliable assessment of the overall benefit-to-risk 
profile of the trial interventions. Prejudgment based 
on overinterpretation of interim data can affect 
recruitment, delivery of interventions and follow-up, 
risking the ability of the trial to achieve its goals (87).
2.5.3 Planning for success and focusing 
on issues that matter
Key messages. Good quality should be prospectively 
built into the design and delivery of clinical trials, 
rather than relying on retrospectively trying to detect 
issues after they have occurred (when often they 

Guidance for best practices for clinical trials26
Guidance for best practices for clinical trialscannot be rectified). Such trials should be described 
in a well-articulated, concise and operationally-viable 
protocol that is tailored to be practicable given the 
available infrastructure in relevant settings.
Why this is important. Rather than trying to avoid 
all possible issues, the aim should be to identify the 
key issues that would have a meaningful impact on 
participants’ well-being and safety or on decision-
making based on the trial results. Efforts should 
then be focused on minimizing, mitigating and 
monitoring those issues. Such an assessment should 
consider the context of the clinical trial and what is 
additional or special about it by comparison with 
routine care. Broadly, these considerations come 
under four headings:
 
(a) factors associated with the intervention 
(for example, known and potential adverse 
effects; comorbidities or concomitant 
medications that might impact safety; 
special requirements for administering the 
intervention)
(b) factors associated with evaluations required 
to reach the study objective that would not 
be expected in usual care (for example, 
additional invasive investigations) 
(c) resource implications (for example, need 
for specialist imaging or laboratory assays; 
unfamiliar or novel procedures requiring 
additional training)
(d) ethical and privacy implications (for example, 
access to medical records and sharing of 
health information with pharmaceutical 
companies, researchers or regulators).
Such an assessment process should then be used to 
guide the development of approaches to mitigate 
errors, such as standard operating procedures, 
training and trial monitoring. Trial processes that 
add scientific or ethical value to clinical trials should 
be prioritized, and those that do not, or where the 
additional complexity outweighs the benefit, should 
be avoided.2.5.4 Monitoring, auditing and 
inspection of study quality
Key message. The nature and frequency of any trial 
monitoring, auditing and inspection activities should 
be proportionate to any identified risks to study 
quality and the importance to the trial of the data 
being collected. 
Why this is important. Good trial monitoring, 
auditing and inspection activities identify issues 
that matter (important deviations from the protocol 
or unexpected issues that threaten to undermine 
the reliability of results or protection of participants’ 
rights and well-being) and provide an opportunity 
to further improve quality (for example, through 
modifications to the protocol and procedures, 
training and mentoring of staff, or information 
provided to participants). Excessive monitoring, 
auditing and inspection activities and failure to focus 
on details that have a material impact on trial quality 
waste resources, create distraction and demotivate 
staff.
Rational monitoring takes a risk-based 
proportionate approach and focuses on the 
issues that will make a material difference to the 
participants in the trial and the reliability of the 
results  (for example, trial recruitment, adherence to 
allocated intervention, blinding and completeness 
of follow-up). It informs corrective actions, supports 
staff and enables improvements. It is important 
not to confuse more documentation with better 
quality. Examples of approaches that may be used 
include central review (including statistical analysis) 
of trial data and performance metrics to assess 
performance of staff and sites, in person or virtual 
support and mentoring for trial staff (for instance, 
through observation of study visits, with participants’ 
consent), and visits to clinical trial sites and facilities.
Regulatory, auditing or inspection requirements 
should be proportionate and sensitive to the scientific 
and ethical qualities and objectives of a clinical 
trial. They should recognize the opportunity cost 
of, and avoid, setting irrelevant or disproportionate 
requirements that might discourage the conduct or 
participation in good clinical trials that are designed 
to address important questions.

clinical trial ecosystem

28The World Health Assembly in resolution WHA75.8 
(2022) on Strengthening clinical trials to provide 
high-quality evidence on health interventions and to 
improve research quality and coordination requested 
WHO’s Director-General to identify and propose 
best practices and other measures to strengthen 
the global clinical trial ecosystem and to review 
existing guidance and develop new guidance as 
needed on best practices for clinical trials. However, 
the resolution does not provide a definition of the 
clinical trial ecosystem, and currently there is no 
consensus on what this should be. The Director-
General therefore invited inputs on how such 
an ecosystem should be defined during a public 
consultation in October–November 2022. Although 
a universal definition was not established, in addition 
to aspects related to clinical trial design, conduct and 
reporting (discussed in Section 2 ) there were calls to 
include a holistic view of the ecosystem that included 
the following elements related to trials:
• public, patient and community involvement 
• the need for long-term support, sustainability 
and ongoing capacity-building, particularly in 
resource-limited settings and LMICs
• equity and justice, with a particular focus on 
under-represented populations and countries 
with a high burden of illness
• sustained approach to funding and a shift 
away from “project-by-project” clinical trials 
infrastructure
• oversight by and liaison with regulatory 
bodies, ethics committees, health technology 
assessment authorities and other relevant 
national authorities 3.	Guidance	on	strengthening	the	
clinical trial ecosystem 
• local, national and international coordination 
and collaboration, with equitable and inclusive 
research partnerships 
• sharing of practices, lesson learned, expertise 
and resources
• the perspective of those conducting systematic 
reviews, meta-analyses and developing 
evidence-based guidelines
• implementation research
• the need for clinical trials and evidence-based 
care to be more culturally embedded in society.
These inputs have fed into the guidance presented 
in this document and resulted in a potential model 
for an ecosystem involving four pillars (see Figure 1) 
and multiple cross-cutting themes as described in 
the following sections.
3.1 Clinical trial ecosystem pillars
All parties should support local ownership and 
leadership in clinical research as part of equitable 
research partnerships  (88). Efficient high-quality 
clinical trials require the relevant parties involved 
to engage proactively in research-priority setting, 
capacity strengthening through sustainable long-
term funding and ensuring an enabling environment 
for clinical research. Research programmes and their 
funding should be informed by not only national but 
also regional and global health research priorities, 
and there should be mechanisms to update 
priorities quickly as new health problems emerge. 
Optimal streamlining and coordination of clinical 
trial approval processes are vital, and there should 
be an adoption of single multiagency clinical trial 
approval and oversight in conjunction with flexible 
risk-proportionate processes. 

29
3. Guidance on strengthening the clinical trial ecosystemClinical trials that address relevant questions can 
only be enabled if all relevant parties work together 
with national governmental coordinating authorities 
for health research to agree and adequately fund 
research priorities. Harmonized clinical trial approval 
processes minimize unnecessary duplication, reduce 
delays and improve efficiency.
Four key pillars for the ecosystem to achieve these 
aims are:
• clinical research governance, funding and 
policy frameworks
• regulatory systems 
• ethical oversight
• clinical research infrastructure.
3.1.1 Clinical research governance, 
funding	and	policy	frameworks
(a)	Setting	of 	research	priorities
As explained in Section 1.5.1 , identification 
of a relevant research question is of paramount 
importance. In setting research priorities, national 
government authorities coordinating health research should consider the main drivers of local disease 
burden and patient and community perspectives, 
but also how any proposed plans align with wider 
regional and international goals so as to maximize 
coordinated use of available resources and hence 
minimize waste. 
It can be particularly beneficial for coordinating 
authorities to maintain active links with other national 
and international clinical research organizations 
in this context. Mapping evidence and identifying 
gaps may also be helpful. Notably, WHO has a key 
role in developing global health research priorities, 
having issued guidance for their development, 
(89) and regional health priorities are often set by 
regional organizations in liaison with WHO. Foreign 
stakeholders seeking to conduct clinical trials in a 
country should also seek to align their plans with 
national and regional health priorities and coordinate 
their work with national health research authorities. 
Conversely, where clinical trials are aligned with 
global priorities, such national authorities have some 
responsibility to avoid unnecessary bureaucracy or 
inefficiencies in enabling such trials. Trials for the 
purpose of local registration of interventions already 
registered in other jurisdictions should only be done 
if there is a solid scientific rationale for their conduct.Figure 1. Clinical trial ecosystem pillars

Guidance for best practices for clinical trials30
Guidance for best practices for clinical trialsRapid priority setting is particularly important 
in public health emergencies, as highlighted in 
resolution WHA75.8 (2022).
(b)	Funding	of 	clinical	trials
Increased sustained investment and funding 
nationally, regionally and internationally are 
paramount for clinical trial progress. Designated 
national funding is particularly vital, as there needs to 
be a commitment to invest in domestic infrastructure 
so that any national base can be built upon globally. 
Such funding can present immense challenges to 
LMICs in particular, but domestic investment in 
clinical research is needed to advance national health 
priorities. The WHO Council on the Economics of 
Health For All aims to reframe health for all as a public 
policy objective and ensure that national and global 
economies and finance are structured in such a way 
to deliver on this ambitious goal. (90, 91)
This funding should plan to encompass (but not be 
limited to): trial infrastructure (including both clinical 
trial facilities and staff; see Section 3.1.4 ); multiparty 
training (see Section 3.2.4 ); support for clinical trial 
registries (see Section 2.3.3 ); and development of 
electronic systems and new methodologies (see  
Section 3.2.7 ).
Akin to the approach for setting research priorities, 
patient and community perspectives must be 
taken into account, and national health research 
funders should also ensure that funding is aligned 
with regional and global priorities, appropriately 
coordinating with other parties to ensure that calls for 
funding are synergistic. This coordination can help to 
avoid duplication and mean that agreed priorities are 
collectively addressed in an efficient manner. There is 
currently a lack of funding sources for international 
clinical trials other than the pharmaceutical industry 
(which plays a crucial role) and a very small number 
of international philanthropic or public sector 
funders. Models need to be developed whereby 
national funders can prioritize support to the 
national elements of priority international trials and 
support the core trial infrastructure. Funders need 
to coordinate such funding efficiently to reduce the 
burden that this places on researchers.
It is vital that all funders understand that, despite the 
importance of seed funding for innovation and the fact that some small trials can be valuable when done 
in the right context, reliable and adequately sized 
clinical trials often necessitate substantial sustained 
long-term financing. Efforts should therefore be made 
to resist the funding of numerous smaller short-term 
uninformative projects conducted in isolation at the 
expense of those that can meaningfully address public 
health issues and policy. Major benefits result from 
coordinated mechanisms for funding (92), including 
public-private partnerships, product development 
partnerships and, in some contexts, central or global 
funding mechanisms. Coordinated funding, when 
done in an agile manner, can hugely enable clinical 
trials by allowing different research funders to come 
together to work collectively towards enabling 
something greater than what any one funder could 
do. Models for coordination of funders are already 
available in several disease areas. Examples include: 
the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases (GACD) 
(93), which brings together major international 
research funding agencies specifically to address 
the growing burden of noncommunicable diseases 
in LMICs and underserved groups experiencing 
health disparities in HICs; the Joint Programming 
Initiative on Antimicrobial Resistance (JPIAMR) (94); 
the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious 
Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R) (95); the European 
& Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership 
(EDCTP) (96), which funds clinical research for medical 
tools to detect, treat and prevent poverty-related 
infectious diseases in sub-Saharan Africa; and the 
Ensuring Value in Research (EViR) funders’ forum (97), 
which aims to advance the practices of health-related 
research and research funding. In the European Union, 
the Innovative Medicines Initiative (98) is an example 
of a large public-private partnership in the field of life 
sciences. As detailed in Section 2.3.3 , funding of clinical 
research should also be transparent, for instance being 
accessible through research investment portals (such 
as WHO’s Global Observatory on Health Research and 
Development)  (99). Such transparency can also help to 
reduce the waste of research resources and support 
alignment to research priorities. This consideration 
may be particularly important for resource-limited 
settings (for example, by revealing how much funding 
is apportioned to HICs compared with that to LMICs).
All parties involved in clinical trials have a 
responsibility to ensure clinical trial quality 
through adherence to the key design and conduct 

31
3. Guidance on strengthening the clinical trial ecosystemprinciples outlined in Section 2 , but funders can 
also act as gatekeepers for ensuring that this is 
done by making provision of funding contingent 
upon it (for example, through use of toolkits for 
trial assessment in a consistent manner worldwide). 
This would incentivize trials to be well-designed 
and well-implemented so that they inform policy 
and improve health outcomes, rather than focusing 
solely on the amount of output generated. Strategic 
allocation of funds could also help funders to target 
resources at some institutions with lower levels of 
capacity (but innate potential) rather than merely 
continuing to fund well-established institutions, 
which are not always representative of populations 
that the interventions are intended to benefit.
Clear processes for accelerating transfer of funding 
for research during public health emergencies 
should also be in place so as to minimize delays in 
initiation of critical research. Annex 1  details specific 
considerations in times of public health emergencies.
In considering funding, it is vital to plan for post-trial 
access to ensure that the resulting interventions are 
accessible, affordable and equitably distributed, 
particularly for under-represented populations and 
those in LMICs. Indeed, the CIOMS ethical guidelines 
for medical research involving humans (14) have 
long stated the importance of ensuring post-trial 
access for participants involved in clinical trials, 
and the TRUST code (100)  specifies that a culturally 
appropriate plan to share benefits should be agreed 
to by all relevant stakeholders and reviewed regularly 
as the research evolves. This principle should be 
enhanced and expanded to support global access 
to health interventions. This planning should start 
right from the beginning of the R&D process, as 
waiting until after an intervention is developed 
provides limited leverage opportunities to negotiate 
fair conditions for wider access and distribution. 
This process can be enabled by governments and 
other funders attaching concrete and enforceable 
conditions when they support or fund clinical trials. 
(c)	Translating	research	evidence	into	
practice 
Health technology assessment agencies and 
national bodies that develop clinical guidelines 
should be engaged throughout the clinical trial 
process. They should liaise with national coordinating 
authorities for health research, regulators and ethics committees, but also work in partnership with end 
users (including patients, communities, the public 
and health care staff/organizations) and build in 
their perspectives. This cooperation will help to 
ensure that the formulation of recommendations 
in guidelines or other policy documents result in 
translation of clinical trial results into practice, and 
hence public health benefits. 
Use should be made of the extensive resources 
on evidence-informed decision-making, such as 
the WHO’s Evidence-informed Policy Network 
(101) , which provides guidance on translation of 
knowledge to health policy-making. This use 
of knowledge translation resources is important 
because even when robust evidence exists for or 
against particular interventions based on high-
quality randomized data, it is not always adopted 
in practice. An example was observed during the 
COVID-19 pandemic, when some countries witnessed 
widespread use of interventions for which there 
was strong evidence of no benefit (such as the use 
of hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19). 
In contrast, an example of appropriate translation 
of research evidence into clinical practice was the 
process used to assess the value of administration 
of antenatal corticosteroids in preventing preterm 
infant mortality in resource-limited settings. During 
the development of WHO’s guidelines, a research gap 
was identified because, although these interventions 
had long been recommended in high-income 
settings, significant uncertainty remained about 
the role and potential harm of this intervention in 
resource-limited settings. To address this question, a 
group of stakeholders prioritized and implemented a 
well-designed randomized trial in several countries in 
Africa and Asia. The trial results were consistent with 
a meta-analysis of trials conducted in high-income 
settings, indicating that antenatal corticosteroids 
reduce preterm infant mortality in both settings. 
Following best practices, WHO’s guidelines were 
updated to incorporate the trial results and any 
other recent evidence into the global evidence base, 
enabling the formulation of global recommendations 
on the use of antenatal corticosteroids to prevent 
preterm infant mortality (102–105) . This approach 
exemplified the integration of guideline processes 
with trial design, implementation and reporting, 
highlighting the importance of evidence synthesis 
at the beginning and end of the research process. 

Guidance for best practices for clinical trials32
Guidance for best practices for clinical trials3.1.2 Regulatory systems 
National regulatory authorities (NRAs) typically act as 
the executive arm for governmental departments of 
health, with agreements often existing between the 
two parties to ensure that they work in partnership to 
serve patients, the public and the taxpayer, and that 
they discharge their accountability responsibilities 
effectively. 
NRAs are primarily responsible for the  regulatory 
oversight of medicinal products. For example, 
they are responsible for approval of clinical 
trial commencement and licensure (marketing 
authorization) of new medicinal products , helping to 
ensure that medicines released for public distribution 
are evaluated properly and meet agreed international 
standards of quality, safety and efficacy and that the 
benefit/risk ratio for the medicine is positive in the 
proposed indication. They also typically perform 
post-marketing surveillance and adverse event 
monitoring of established interventions. Some 
NRAs are mature and extensive, whereas others 
have much more limited capacity. As such, NRAs are 
a core component of the research environment, and 
for clinical trials to fulfil their potential NRAs must 
be able to robustly and efficiently support clinical 
trials using risk-based proportionate approaches. In 
addition to NRAs and ethics committees (see below), 
further clinical trial approval is sometimes required 
at a local level by institutional committees. 
The WHO Secretariat can provide technical assistance 
for the development and implementation of NRA 
strengthening plans including those for the oversight 
of clinical trials. The WHO Global Benchmarking 
Tool for evaluation of national regulatory systems 
for medicinal products (106)  provides a maturity-
level framework for Member States to improve the 
functioning of their NRAs.
NRAs should act in a timely manner, have clinical 
trial review competency, be transparent about their 
document-submission requirements and provide 
transparency on timelines achieved for clinical 
trial approval. Procedures should be kept under 
review and any unnecessary bureaucracy should 
be eliminated, with approaches and procedures 
adapting to changes in the clinical trial landscape.
Many clinical trials do not involve generation of data for submission to NRAs. In some health 
condition areas most trials will not be submitted 
for marketing authorization approval, where for 
example behavioural interventions are the focus. 
It is important that NRAs are only involved for trials 
within their scope according to the local regulations.
3.1.3 Ethical oversight
Ethical considerations cut across all areas of health, as 
reflected in the wide range of health topics addressed 
by WHO’s ethics guidance. Cornerstone reference 
documents for appropriate ethical practice in clinical 
trials include the WMA Declaration of Helsinki (1964, 
last updated in 2013) (12), the WMA Declaration 
of Taipei on Ethical Considerations regarding 
Health Databases and Biobanks (13), and the CIOMS 
International Ethical Guidelines for Health-related 
Research Involving Humans (2016) (14).
At a country level, local research ethics committees 
(RECs, sometimes known as institutional review boards 
[IRBs]) review all research involving human participants 
including clinical trial proposals and have the authority 
to approve, reject or propose modifications. When 
appropriate, RECs may also suspend or terminate 
clinical trials. RECs operate independently and have 
autonomy to make their decisions. Membership of 
RECs is multidisciplinary so as to ensure different 
perspectives, thus including members who may have 
community or societal perspectives or represent the 
interests of potential participants. 
The WHO Secretariat has launched a tool that is 
intended to support Member States in evaluating 
their capacity to provide appropriate ethical 
oversight of health-related research with human 
beings (107) . In the Region of the Americas, the Pan 
American Health Organization has issued indicators 
for strengthening national research ethics systems 
and a tool for the accreditation of RECs (108) . 
RECs should act in a timely manner, have clinical 
trial review competency, be transparent about their 
document submission requirements, and provide 
transparency on time taken for clinical trial approval. 
Procedures should be kept under review, and any 
unnecessary bureaucracy should be eliminated, with 
approaches and procedures adapting to changes in 
the clinical trial landscape. 

33
3. Guidance on strengthening the clinical trial ecosystemInteragency coordination and harmonization 
Given the multiple parties involved in authorizations 
of multicentre clinical trials, actions should be 
taken to reduce duplication while ensuring 
rigorous and prompt authorization processes. For 
instance, systems of parallel submission to different 
stakeholders (for example, NRAs and RECs), reliance 
mechanisms or joint reviews for the authorization 
of clinical trials may be helpful to promote 
efficiency.  In tandem, any such systems require 
adoption of flexible risk-proportionate processes 
through education and appropriate incentives.
WHO supports efforts to promote efficiency through 
single REC models for multicentre clinical trials, 
where appropriate, and encourages further work to 
advance single REC models.
WHO already encourages regulatory harmonization 
and good reliance procedures, with good practice 
being for regulatory authorities to take into account 
and give significant weight to work performed by 
other regulators, as appropriate. Given that clinical 
trials are highly important to evaluate not only 
medicinal products but also nonpharmacological 
interventions, pooling expertise into a single national 
body can maximize use of resources. 
Development of such systems can build upon 
experience of regions which have already fostered 
them. In the European Union, clinical trial sponsors 
can use the EU’s Clinical Trials Information System  (109)  
to apply for regulatory authorization to run a 
clinical trial in up to 30 countries in the European 
Economic Area through a single online application, 
which includes the NRA, REC and trial registration 
submissions in a single process. Building upon this 
and the EU’s Clinical Trials Regulation, the European 
Commission, the Heads of Medicines Agencies and 
the European Medicines Agency have launched an 
initiative to transform how clinical trials are initiated, 
designed and run, referred to as Accelerating Clinical 
Trials in the European Union Initiative (ACT EU) (110) .  
Equally, the Health Research Authority in England 
is a national strategic research oversight body that 
promotes coordinated approaches to research review 
across the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland through its Integrated Research 
Application System (111) . This is a single system for 
applying for the regulatory and ethics permissions and approvals for research on health and social care/
community care in the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland. Another operationally-
effective model for coordinated review of clinical 
trials authorization includes the African Vaccine 
Regulators Forum (AVAREF) (112) . This network’s joint 
review procedure is endorsed by all the countries on 
the African continent to support R&D and strengthen 
the capacity of clinical trial oversight. It provides a 
platform for parallel review by NRAs, national RECs 
and all relevant local RECs and IRBs of multicountry 
clinical trial applications, enabling provision of 
coordinated review to trial sponsors with agreed 
timeframes for clinical trial approval. Interagency 
cooperation is also demonstrated by the Forum for 
Ethical Review Committees in the Asian and Western 
Pacific Region (FERCAP). This is a regional forum 
under the umbrella of the Strategic Initiative for 
Developing Capacity in Ethical Review (SIDCER) (113)  
which aims to improve collaboration among ethics 
committees reviewing health research in that region, 
being a project of the WHO Special Training and 
Research Programme in Tropical Diseases (TDR) (114) . 
The International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory 
Authorities (115)  is exploring several approaches 
to harmonization and collaborative assessments 
between agencies with the aim of streamlining and 
improving efficiency and coordination of procedures 
for multicountry trials, without undermining their 
quality, safety or ethical aspects. Such models need 
to be developed further, especially in relation to 
advancing coordination between RECs, action that 
will need investment in infrastructure at national, 
regional and global levels. 
The HIV pandemic and epidemics such as those of 
Ebola or Zika virus disease highlighted the need 
for more interagency harmonization. In 2020, WHO 
published detailed guidance on rapid review of 
research by RECs during public health emergencies 
(116) , and the AVAREF model has been used 
successfully in such a context. In 2020, based on 
lessons learned during the outbreaks of Ebola virus 
disease, AVAREF published a guidance document on 
strategy and guidance for emergency preparedness 
(117) . This provision was later successfully used for 
one of the largest multicountry clinical trials in 
Africa, involving 13 countries and several sponsors. 
With this emergency provision, three options are 

Guidance for best practices for clinical trials34
Guidance for best practices for clinical trialsnow available for AVAREF joint reviews, with the 
timelines reflecting the public health impact of the 
investigational product based on selection criteria.  
The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic further 
highlighted the particular importance of rapid review 
of clinical trials submissions and decision-making in 
public health emergencies of international concern, 
and as such this topic forms a core component of 
resolution WHA75.8 (2022). Several initiatives have 
already been developed to respond to any such 
situation. In particular, WHO has developed a R&D 
Blueprint for Epidemics which adopts a proactive 
approach to bolstering global readiness and response 
to potential future epidemics and pandemics, with 
an overarching goal of reducing the time required 
for the development of safe and effective medical 
countermeasures, both curative and preventive. The 
R&D Blueprint includes guidance on rapid review 
of research by ethics committees during public 
health emergencies (also see Annex 1 ) (118) . Other 
initiatives include a US Clinical Trials Infrastructure for 
Emergencies (119)  and the 100 Days Mission report 
to the G7 by the pandemic preparedness partnership 
which discusses how best to reduce the impact of 
any future threats (120) .
The Healthy Life Trajectories Initiative (121)  is another 
example of how interagency cooperation can 
effectively target and drive high-quality research 
aligned with country needs. In 2015, national research 
funding agencies in Canada, China, India and South 
Africa, with support from the WHO Secretariat, 
agreed to collaborate and provide support for clinical 
trials in each country aimed at testing interventions 
to mitigate the risk of childhood obesity and type 2 
diabetes. These trials focused on preconception and 
pregnancy interventions and their impact on early 
growth, adiposity and early markers of metabolic 
disease. As part of the initiative’s consortium, research 
teams harmonized research questions, interventions 
and data and biospecimen collection, and as such 
the research initiative embodies how a road map can 
optimize research investment.  
3.1.4 Clinical research infrastructure 
Efficient high-quality clinical trials require adequate 
infrastructure, both in terms of physical infrastructure 
and trial personnel. Where possible, the trials should involve use and optimization of pre-existing 
resources and facilities, including those associated 
with routine health care practice, as previously 
described in Section 2.4.2  so as to minimize research 
waste, enable the best use of limited funds and 
ensure that undue complexity is not introduced. 
Democratization of access to infrastructure can 
be enabled by joint use of resources. Sharing of 
expertise is vital; knowledge and capacity-building 
gained through clinical trial involvement represent 
an indirect benefit that extends well beyond the 
knowledge gained by the trial results themselves. 
This can, for example, support continuity in research 
and follow-on projects through trial staff, patients 
and communities becoming familiar with the 
principles and dividends of evidence-based care. 
(a)	Physical	infrastructure
Physical infrastructure for clinical research is highly 
diverse, covering a range of clinical settings and 
research facilities, plus the logistical infrastructure 
necessary to support them. However, two key 
components of this infrastructure are typically 
laboratories (a core need for many types of clinical 
trial, depending on the intervention being assessed) 
and clinical research institutions and clinical trial 
units (CTUs). These can be established within public 
government-funded facilities bodies, academic 
institutions or the private sector, or function as a 
result of a partnership between such groups. Physical 
infrastructure also encompasses use of electronic 
health care systems and digital technology. 
Investment in sustained, cost-efficient laboratory 
facilities is paramount. Factors to consider in relation 
to adequate laboratory infrastructure include:
• running costs of equipment
• staff requirements to support use of such 
equipment 
• appropriate laboratory accreditation to 
ensure ongoing equipment maintenance and 
calibration (and hence quality)
• access to central/reference laboratories, 
where applicable, to ensure standardization 
(for example, for pharmacokinetics and 
microbiology assessments)

35
3. Guidance on strengthening the clinical trial ecosystem• appropriate sample storage and transportation 
facilities 
• optimal commissioning and long-term 
maintenance of electronic laboratory systems. 
Clinical trials of interventions early in development 
are a particular example of the need for some 
specialized laboratory infrastructure. Some African 
and Asian countries are beginning to conduct such 
early trials (for example, studies of Ebola virus disease 
vaccines were done in HICs but also in low-resource 
communities not experiencing an outbreak (122) , 
and late-stage clinical trials of relevant vaccines are 
increasingly being conducted in LMICs) (123) .
At lower-capacity levels, every country should 
be supported in establishing at least one well-
functioning national clinical research institution 
with a focus on the design, conduct and governance 
of reliable, efficient clinical trials. At higher-capacity 
levels, numerous such clinical research institutions 
may already exist and may have expanded to develop 
specializations in certain thematic areas or types 
of health research (such as biomedical science, 
implementation science and behavioural science).  
Currently there is substantial duplication of clinical 
trial infrastructure and lack of coordination between 
numerous coordinating centres for clinical trials and 
CTUs (which often operate using different processes 
even when collaborating on the same projects). 
In addition, smaller CTUs often struggle to provide 
job security, training and opportunities for career 
progression, which may result in high staff turnover 
rates, short-term contracts, job dissatisfaction and 
low-quality work environments. Consequently, many 
small CTUs cannot retain or recruit staff and are unable 
to take up opportunities to participate in clinical trials 
when offered. This situation is particularly true in rural, 
regional and remote areas where it is most difficult to 
build and retain capacity, and this further entrenches 
inequity of access. It is therefore widely recognized 
that there is a need to foster a shift away from 
disease-specific clinical research institutions or CTUs 
to broad-based CTUs that have a disease-agnostic 
capability deployable to numerous scenarios  and 
which can then work with or develop additional 
clinical research sites within relevant communities to 
respond to public health needs. These CTUs can then access disease-specific expertise as needed. Global 
funders (public, private and philanthropic) need to 
invest substantially in developing and sustaining such 
disease-agnostic CTUs and associated clinical research 
networks (see Section 3.2.2 ).
WHO is elaborating a CTU maturity framework, 
which may prove especially helpful in countries 
without pre-existing systems by providing a 
commonly agreed structure for developing 
such CTUs.  A tiered system with different metrics 
according to a CTU’s purpose and functional maturity 
will be fostered, based upon consensus criteria. This 
system will allow for appropriate tailoring of the 
criteria (for example, what will be specified for CTUs 
acting as regional or national hubs supporting larger 
trials will differ from the infrastructure required in 
smaller local CTUs feeding into such hubs). 
Access to health care and clinical facilities in general 
needs to be strengthened in order to facilitate clinical 
research and embedding clinical research within 
routine national healthcare systems across all care 
settings (home/community/primary, secondary, 
tertiary) should also be encouraged. Immense 
potential benefits stem from incorporating clinical 
trials into point-of-care trial processes, for instance:
• cost and efficiency savings
• embedding research personnel throughout 
health care systems increases democratization of 
staff involvement which can lead to much wider 
awareness of, and enthusiasm for, clinical trials 
• extending trial sites from large national centres 
to smaller local centres or indeed patients’ homes 
(such as in decentralized trials) and “taking 
trials to the people” facilitate larger sample size 
(hence adequate statistical power) and broader 
participation (hence representativeness and 
increased probability of meaningful results that 
improve patient care). 
Automated and digital processes should be 
encouraged and supported globally to increase clinical 
trial speed, efficiency and transparency. Building such 
electronic health care systems will enable long-term 
research connectivity. However, such systems need to 
be affordable, sustainable and efficient. 

Guidance for best practices for clinical trials36

A well-functioning clinical trial ecosystem is one 
that supports the careers of clinical researchers 
through local programmes and funding options for 
all career stages, including local leadership of clinical 
research. It is essential that training focuses on the 
key scientific and ethical considerations in a risk-
proportionate manner as laid out in Section 2  and 
enables personnel to take up innovative approaches 
in a flexible manner.The UNICEF/UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special 
Programme for Research and Training in Tropical 
Diseases (114)  Global Competency Framework for 
Clinical Research (124)  lists all the competencies that 
should be demonstrated by a clinical research team 
to undertake a successful study (see Figure 2). Note 
that in addition to the entities shown, consideration 
also needs to be given to entities with the necessary 
attributes, capability and capacity to act as clinical

3. Guidance on strengthening the clinical trial ecosystemarranging of financing of clinical trials at national 
and multinational levels). Such sponsors are needed 
in addition to local research investigators and those 
in individual centres of scientific excellence even if 
these may be part of the resource involved.
The framework can be applied to any research study, 
regardless of the size of the team, place, disease 
focus and type of research. However, it should be 
noted that not all competencies are required in every 
research unit as some elements (such as creation 
and maintenance of the trial database) may be 
located and performed at a central coordination 
unit. Together with its supporting tools (such as 
the associated competency dictionary) (125) , the 
framework is also intended to be used to help to 
plan staff requirements for a study, carry out staff  
appraisals, guide career development and create 
educational curricula for research staff.
Appropriate training and mentoring of clinical trial 
staff are vital (see Section 3.2.4 ). Specific attention 
should be given to addressing any current barriers 
to recruitment and training of people potentially 
interested in clinical research, including the need for 
a minimum period of previous clinical trial experience 
or certain academic qualifications as this may exclude 
potentially promising people, especially those with 
fewer financial resources, those from lower resource 
settings or those with certain demographics.
3.2	 Clinical	trial	ecosystem	cross-
cutting themes
The aforementioned four pillars can only optimally 
function if several other common factors are enabled. 
These cross-cutting themes include: 
• patient and community engagement
• collaboration, coordination and networking 
• use of common systems and standards 
• training and mentoring 
• risk-proportionate efficient approaches
• sustainability• innovation
• transparency.

As already described in sections 1.4 and 2.3.1 , 
partnership with patients and communities 
(including, for example, not just patients but patient 
organizations’ representatives, individual patient 
advocates, family members, carers and supporters)  
is vital to the clinical trial ecosystem to ensure that 
clinical trials are designed to answer questions 
relevant to the populations they are intended to 
serve, to foster trust, enable diversity and instil a sense 
of the importance of clinical research in the wider 
population. This should be a norm and embedded 
in an appropriate manner in all trials; it is not an 
optional extra and should be a continuous cycle of 
knowledge sharing and dissemination as opposed 
to sporadic campaigns launched immediately pre-
trial. Expertise in engagement therefore needs to be 
developed as part of the core set of skills needed to 
design and conduct clinical trials appropriately. Lack 
of feedback on how patients’ input or data were used 
can result in patients questioning the value of their 
engagement and subsequently a lack of commitment 
to future opportunities; this must be avoided.
3.2.2 Collaboration, coordination and 
networking	
As already described in Section 2.3.2 , reliably 
informative, high-quality clinical trials that address 
relevant questions require all relevant parties to 
communicate and collaborate so as to effectively 
share ideas and expertise, reduce duplication and 
misaligned approaches, build capacity, maximize 
use of resources and increase efficiency. The need 
for improved fairness in clinical research has also 
been highlighted by the UNESCO-supported TRUST 
Global Code of Conduct for equitable research 
partnerships (100) , and by the Enhancing Support 
for Strengthening the Effectiveness of National 
Capacity Efforts (ESSENCE) and UK Collaborative 
on Development Research (UKCDR) Good Practice 
Document, a research capacity initiative (88). 

Guidance for best practices for clinical trials38
Guidance for best practices for clinical trialsClinical research networks and discipline- and 
disease-specific consortia can play a crucial role in 
enabling coordination between parties, accelerating 
the generation of high-quality evidence and reducing 
waste. Numerous such networks were identified 
through the public consultation that the WHO 
Secretariat held in late 2022. Many such networks 
already exist in HICs, such as the European Clinical 
Research Infrastructure Network (ECRIN) (126) , United 
Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care 
Research’s Clinical Research Network (NIHR CRN) 
(127) , and the pan-Canadian consortium Accelerating 
Clinical Trials (ACT) (128)  which was established to 
facilitate, optimize and accelerate high-quality, high-
impact RCTs. 
However, there is also a wealth of networks in other 
settings. On a global footing, the Clinical Research 
Initiative for Global Health (CRIGH) (129)  and The 
Global Health Network (TGHN) (130)  aim to optimize 
clinical research programmes by, for example, sharing 
methods and processes, developing standards and 
encouraging international cooperation, while the 
Global Network for Women’s and Children’s Health 
Research (64) is dedicated to improving maternal 
and child health outcomes and building research 
capacity in resource-poor settings. The ARO Alliance 
for ASEAN and East Asia (ARISE) (131)  promotes clinical 
research and development in the Asian region, and 
the Indian Clinical Trial and Education Network 
(INTENT) (132)  is an example of how different regions 
can work towards developing disease-agnostic 
networks for clinical trials. In Brazil the Ministry of 
Health is establishing a national clinical research 
network, and WHO’s African Region has also been 
the focus of major networking and strengthening of 
research capacity, bolstered by international strategic 
partnerships such as the African Union-European 
Union Innovation Agenda (133) . However, trials in 
other regions are often hampered by major gaps in 
such networks, as identified in parts of Latin America, 
the Caribbean, Eastern Europe, WHO’s Eastern 
Mediterranean Region and parts of Asia, meaning 
that further collaborations and initiatives need to 
be developed to truly allow global cooperation to 
fulfil its potential. 
Engaging with nongovernmental organizations may 
also be essential to do research in parts of the world that are inaccessible for research because of conflict 
and/or political reasons.
Member States are encouraged to consider 
developing platforms to facilitate collaboration 
in their countries, such as maintaining a database 
of all national clinical research institutions so that 
researchers, funders and other parties who want 
to partner with a particular institution know what 
capacities exist in the country.
3.2.3 Use of common systems and 
standards 
Data sharing can be hugely valuable in the context 
of, for example, meta-analyses. As already outlined 
in sections 2.1.7  and 2.1.8  use of data standards, 
common approved protocol templates  (for 
example, which include standard items based upon 
those described in the Standard Protocol Items: 
Recommendations for Interventional Trials [SPIRIT] 
guidelines (134) ) and core outcomes can allow for 
collection of data that enables more efficient 
amalgamation of datasets . Data sharing should take 
into account concerns about data privacy and security, 
with appropriate anonymization measures being 
taken to remove any patient identifiable information. 
As stated in Section 2.3.3 , a data management and 
sharing plan should be developed in line with WHO 
data-sharing principles of being effective, ethical 
and equitable, as articulated in the WHO policy on 
research data sharing  (85).
3.2.4 Training and mentoring 
Investment in education and training is required 
in all regions through accessible (practically and 
financially) fit-for-purpose training packages.  There 
is a need to broaden core understanding for all those 
involved in trials of key methodological trial design, 
implementation and reporting principles (including 
risk-based proportionate approaches and ‘quality 
by design’), as well as key ethical considerations 
for clinical trials. This should help to avoid a silo 
mentality, reduce duplication of effort and minimize 
misunderstandings about trial applications. Such 
training should focus on all levels of the clinical 
trial infrastructure, not only established CTUs; it 
should be provided to not only trial investigators 

39
3. Guidance on strengthening the clinical trial ecosystembut also those in community-based settings (so as to 
empower local researchers and health professionals), 
patient advocacy or engagement groups, research 
coordinators and managers, members of ethics 
committees and people in regulatory agencies, as 
well as younger researchers (especially those in low-
resource settings). 
Robust training and investment in statistical 
methodology and capacity and clinical data 
management are central to trials capacity 
development. They should enable appropriate 
sample size estimations, favouring fewer, larger, well-
designed trials and giving greater clarity as to when 
small trials may be appropriate for specific situations. 
Tailored, specialized training, especially for local 
clinical trial leadership, is crucial given the current 
dominance of international trials led from high 
income countries. Formal and informal peer learning 
and mentorship systems, allowing smaller centres to 
benefit from national or regional centres of excellence 
and junior researchers to learn from more experienced 
ones, are to be encouraged in order to further 
enhance the robustness and effectiveness of clinical 
trials education. Such systems will enable transfer 
of skills and opportunities for career development, 
in line with the principles of equitable partnerships.
Another pressing need is promotion of understanding 
and adoption of innovative trial designs, including 
adaptive platform and cluster designs.
An internationally-recognized framework for training 
competency and maturity tools to assess self-
development will be vital to enable the continual 
development and assessment of training needs of 
all staff involved in clinical research. Some such tools 
are already available in other contexts. For example, 
the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) has worked in collaboration with WHO, the 
Global National Immunization Technical Advisory 
Groups Network (NITAG GNN) and The Task Force for 
Global Health to develop a maturity assessment tool 
for such Technical Advisory Groups (135, 136) . 
General public understanding of clinical trials 
could be fostered by encouraging basic clinical trial 
knowledge to be included as part of national school 
curriculums. 3.2.5	 Efficiency	
As outlined in sections 1.4, 2.1.8  and 3.1, a move 
away from traditional risk-averse mentality through 
adoption of risk-proportionate approaches is integral 
to improving clinical trial quality and efficiency. This 
can be motivated through education and appropriate 
incentives for adopting such methodology. 
3.2.6 Sustainability
It is absolutely vital that any investment in the 
clinical trial ecosystem is done after an assessment 
of affordability, equity and long-term sustainability 
of any systems, infrastructure and staffing.  
Careful consideration also needs to be given to the 
environmental impact of clinical trials, with efforts 
made to foster responsible practices in relation to 
the climate and environment (137) .
3.2.7 Innovation
Investment in innovation offers an important 
opportunity for clinical trials and is increasingly 
being recognized by multiple stakeholders including 
academic institutions, regulators, ethics committees, 
funders and industry. Digital technology, in particular 
that for building affordable and sustainable electronic 
health care systems, is needed to improve efficiency 
and enable research connectivity in the longer term. 
Where possible, processes should be automated to 
improve not only the speed but also transparency 
of clinical trials. Such systems may also improve trial 
quality by incorporating inbuilt checks for certain 
variables. Appropriate use of technology enabled by 
artificial intelligence, such as advanced data analytics, 
automation and enhanced mobile applications, 
wearable biosensors and connected devices, offers 
the potential to improve efficiency and expand 
the scope of potential outcomes. Search tools and 
matching services that leverage artificial intelligence 
may also help to match patients effectively with 
appropriate clinical trials, a step that could promote 
health equity and inclusion. As artificial intelligence 
applications advance rapidly it will be essential for 
the clinical trial ecosystem to allow for enhancements 
and efficiencies that this and other technologies 
will bring. To do so will require an agile approach by 
researchers and regulators to enable advancements 
while mitigating risks.

There is a need to enable wider exploration and 
adoption of more diverse trial designs (such as 
platform, adaptive and cluster designs) deployable 
across a range of settings and decentralized or 
point-of-care designs which can be embedded in 
routine care  (138) .  
The field of pharmacogenomics offers the potential 
for more personalized care, while modelling 
techniques or synthetic or data-driven control arms 
may help to enable clinical trials in certain settings. Such innovation is vital, but it must ensure that it 
embraces the key scientific and ethical considerations 
for clinical trials outlined in Section 2 . 
3.2.8 Transparency
As already discussed in Section 2.3.3 , transparency 
across multiple aspects of clinical trials is imperative 
to improve efficiency, foster trust and facilitate 
appropriate data sharing.

42Clinical trials can transform health care and quality 
of life worldwide.  To fulfil their potential, they need 
to be reliably informative, ethical and efficient, and 
answer scientifically important questions relevant 
to the populations they are intended to benefit. This 
goal can be attained through identification of relevant 4. Conclusion
research questions, risk-based and proportionate 
design, conduct, monitoring and audit of clinical 
trials, and strengthening of the global clinical trial 
ecosystem. These steps in turn require partnership 
with patients and their communities, equitable and 
sustained funding and global collaboration.

44Annex 1. Provisions for rapid funding and 
approval of good randomized evidence 
generation in emergencies
Given the possibility of major adverse societal impacts in health emergencies, including fatalities or long-term 
sequelae in those experiencing infection with a newly emerging disease, it is ethically imperative to ensure 
that new information is generated during public health emergencies. There may be few or no data on safety 
and effectiveness of preventive or therapeutic interventions. As underlined in resolution WHA75.8 (2022), 
clinical trials underpin the generation of reliable information on safety and effectiveness of interventions in 
both normal times and emergencies.
A key lesson learned from the COVID-19 pandemic is that clinical trial procedures should be developed in 
normal times in order to enable rapid activation of protocols in emergencies for facilitation of a rapid large-
scale response to meet compelling public health needs. 
Therefore, one aspect of strengthening of clinical trials ecosystems is inclusion of appropriate provisions that 
allow for the following activities as soon as a health emergency is declared by WHO or by national authorities: 
• rapid agreement on research priorities including those that require clinical trials 
• coordination and collaboration of stakeholders to enable the design or activation of pre-existing approved 
master protocols
• initiation, conduct and reporting of good clinical trials as quickly as possible 
• translation of results into policy decision-making by regulators and public health authorities.
These points require those involved in clinical trials to follow good practices for funding and regulatory and 
ethics procedures in emergencies, including restatement of the provisions in normal times that also apply in 
emergencies. Key points made in WHA 75.8 in relation to this are outlined below.
A1.1 Funding of research during public health emergencies 
Enacting new funding contracts for researchers amid a health emergency leads to delays in initiation of priority 
research. It is therefore preferable to have arrangements in place beforehand so that staff can rapidly be 
redeployed to the conduct of clinical trials and other research in emergencies. Standing network arrangements 
and previously-agreed master protocols with provisions for emergencies can greatly accelerate timelines. 
Funders should encourage use of standardized protocols for data collection that allow for aggregation of data 
on interventions and outcomes between trials during review of evidence. Clinical trial protocols should be 
well-designed and well-implemented as outlined in Section 2 . 
Funders should mandate registration in a publicly-available clinical trial registry within WHO’s International 
Clinical Trials Registry Platform or another registry that meets its standards.
Funders should promote, as appropriate, measures to facilitate the timely reporting of both positive and 

45
Annex 1. Provisions for rapid funding and approval of good randomized evidence generation in emergenciesnegative interpretable clinical trial results in alignment with WHO’s joint statement on public disclosure of 
results from clinical trials including registration of the results on a publicly available clinical trial registry 
within the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and encouraging timely publication of the trial results 
preferably in an open-access publication.
Funders should promote transparent translation into clinical guidelines, where appropriate, of results from 
clinical trials, including comparison with existing interventions on effectiveness, based on thorough assessment.
Funders should explore measures during public health emergencies of international concern to encourage 
researchers to rapidly and responsibly share interpretable results of clinical trials, including negative results, with 
national regulatory bodies or other appropriate authorities, including WHO for clinical guideline development 
and Emergency Use Listing, to support rapid regulatory decision-making and emergency adaptation of clinical 
and public health guidelines as appropriate, and dissemination, including pre-print publication.
A1.2 Supporting rapid decision-making by regulatory bodies in 
emergencies
Resolution WHA75.8 (2022) states that Member States should, “in accordance with their national and regional 
legal and regulatory frameworks and contexts and, as appropriate, … support new and existing mechanisms to 
facilitate rapid regulatory decision-making during public health emergencies of international concern, so that:
(a) safe, ethical, well-designed clinical trials can be approved and progress quickly;
(b) data from clinical trials can be assessed rapidly, for example through the WHO Emergency Use Listing 
procedure, and health interventions deemed safe and effective can be swiftly authorized. ”Regulatory 
bodies, whether those focusing on research ethics or marketing authorization of medicines and health 
products, can only respond quickly in emergencies if they have adequate resources and capacity. 
Therefore, it is essential that resources are provided for trained personnel in regulatory bodies, 
including those concerned with research ethics. This area is sometimes neglected in considerations 
of strengthening research capacity.
Member States should have a process for rapid review by NRAs, RECs or IRBs of submissions of clinical trials 
in the context of health emergencies. Clinical trials judged to be a national priority should be reviewed and 
approved by a single REC or IRB in a country, avoiding excessive parallel reviews by many RECs or IRBs in the 
same country, and the rapid review process should provide guidance on which single REC or IRB will provide 
oversight in the country.
A1.3 Detailed guidance was published by WHO, as part of the 
R&DBlueprint activities, in 2020 on rapid review of research by 
ethics committees, sharing of results (118) 
During public health emergencies of international concern, further measures should be explored to encourage 
researchers to expedite fast and responsible sharing of interpretable results of clinical trials (for example, 
through pre-print publication) with national regulatory bodies or other appropriate authorities, including 
WHO for clinical guideline development and Emergency Use Listing. This in turn will support rapid regulatory 
decision-making and emergency adaptation of clinical and public health guidelines as appropriate.

Guidance for best practices for clinical trials46
Guidance for best practices for clinical trialsAnnex 2. Recommendations for Member States, 
research	funders	and	researchers
These recommendations relate to clinical trials for any disease or health condition and for any purpose (see 
section on Scope ). The recommendations1 listed below are all aimed at enabling reliably-informative, locally-
relevant clinical research in all settings (including resource-limited settings), with fair sharing of responsibilities, 
burdens and benefits. They have been grouped by target audiences, being split into high-level and topic-specific 
recommendations. Although the recommendations for the reader’s own group will be of primary interest to 
them, those for the other groups can facilitate understanding of the other stakeholders’ perspectives and thus 
promote successful collaborative working. 
A2.1 High-level recommendations
A2.1.1 For Member States and regulatory authorities
The target audiences could include relevant ministries (such as those concerned with health or science), 
authorities in charge of regulating health products and bodies in charge of scientific and ethical review of 
research protocols.
Should Member States and regulatory authorities want to take measures to create a conducive research 
environment, they should consider some or all of the recommended actions listed below:
(a) invest in a sustainable research environment in terms of general infrastructure, security, health systems 
infrastructure, equipment and human resources, and support the establishment or maintenance of 
centres and networks to conduct clinical research; 
(b) seek to improve efficiency in regulatory authorities and ethics committees for oversight of clinical trials, 
to streamline procedures wherever possible and appropriate, and to adopt a proportionate approach 
balancing rigour of review with risks posed by the proposed research;
(c) create incentives and opportunities for engaging and training new researchers and for setting up and 
maintaining research sites, and inform local researchers of options where funding for clinical research 
can be obtained;
(d) clarify regulatory requirements, avoiding legal uncertainties, and harmonize them with those of other 
countries; identify unnecessary obstacles and reduce bureaucracy; shorten ethics and regulatory review 
timelines; and rely on the decisions of other authorities wherever possible; 
(e) establish and enforce effective regulations for ethical review; ensure appropriate protection – which 
does not mean exclusion – of under-represented people and those in vulnerable situations in research 
so that these populations are not precluded from potential access to safe and effective interventions; 
(f) support the establishment of platforms for researchers to engage with patient representatives and 
communities, for example community advisory boards; and request and consider formal communication 
plans as part of applications for clinical studies;

47
Annex 2. Recommendations for Member States, research funders and researchers(g) invest in constructive dialogue with stakeholders, including patients and communities, on research 
priorities and methods to generate relevant evidence, including members of under-represented 
populations such as children; and link research findings with implementation, as appropriate, in national 
health systems to advance delivery of evidence-based health care. 
A2.1.2 For researchers
These could include researchers from academic institutions, the health care industry, contract research 
organizations and noncommercial entities.
Domestic and international researchers have the responsibility to act accountably and transparently and to build 
public trust in the value of clinical research for the populations in which it is conducted. Therefore, they should:
(a) understand and respect the local context, for example, social and cultural aspects, health systems, 
laboratory equipment and facilities, assay technologies, scientific and administrative capacities, as 
well as the local epidemiology and genetics of diseases of the population; 
(b) aim to build sustainable research capacity in resource-limited settings;
(c) ensure a focus on the key features for well-designed and well-implemented trials as outlined in Section 2  
of this document;
(d) engage local study participants and communities throughout the research, from an early stage of 
study design, to ensure that the research addresses questions meaningful to them and adheres to 
high ethical standards (thus helping to generate relevant findings and facilitate their translation into 
health benefits, thereby justifying the burdens of the study on the local population) and not divert 
resources from already-overstretched local health care systems; 
(e) plan in advance how to communicate and engage, throughout all phases of the clinical research, 
with community stakeholders such as participants, participants’ partners and families, community, 
traditional and religious leaders, or advisory boards; and be transparent about the aims and interests 
of all parties involved; 
(f) ensure that any clinical research project has scientifically-justified research questions, with study 
designs and data-collection methods that are sufficiently efficient and robust to generate high-quality 
evidence and, where relevant, contribute to systematic reviews that underpin policies and guidelines; 
(g) where feasible, integrate trial activities into the work of points of care to simplify trial conduct;
(h) consider the use of innovative, adaptive study designs and novel digital technologies, for example trial-
at-home, electronic health records and artificial intelligence where such methods decrease complexity 
and burden for participants and support generation of reliable evidence; 
(i) invest in integrity of scientific data, transparency and confidentiality of personal data at all phases of 
the planning, conduct and implementation of the study, including dissemination of study results and 
reporting, with due consideration given to relevant guidelines;
(j) ensure appropriate inclusion of members of under-represented populations such as children, pregnant 
and lactating women and older people;

Guidance for best practices for clinical trials(k) access or conduct a review of data and literature on the proposed research topic for data relevant to 
the planned research setting, so that any new research builds on existing knowledge. Capacities for 
synthesis of evidence are an essential aspect of research, for use before and after completion of the 
research study.
A2.1.3 For international organizations and funders
Organizations that initiate and/or fund research have a significant influence in shaping policies and practices. 
They should also monitor the financial resources disbursed and ensure effective budget management and, 
where necessary, build capacity to do so. These groups are urged to synergize their resources and to support 
building and maintaining clinical research capacity through the following recommended strategies:
(a) prioritize research that answers important questions definitively and is relevant for the specific setting 
and the health care systems of the communities involved;
(b) support policies and multifunctional coalitions (including public–private partnerships or product 
development partnerships) that facilitate a conducive environment for investing and participating in 
reliably-informative local clinical research;
(c) support the establishment and maintenance of functional, efficient and effective multicountry systems 
and coalitions for ethical and regulatory oversight of clinical research;
(d) educate, empower and support patient organizations and communities to foster an understanding of 
the value of clinical research;
(e) make agreements strongly encouraging open collaboration and data sharing through information 
technology and electronic health records, avoiding fragmentation of research efforts and capacity, 
and support dissemination of study information and results.

49
Annex 2. Recommendations for Member States, research funders and researchersA2.2.1 Creating an enabling environment for clinical trials
Member States are encouraged to create an enabling environment for health research, 
including clinical trials, and appreciate the benefits that this will bring to the quality of the 
health systems and practitioners and the health (and economic status) of the people they 
serve. 
Funders and researchers should work with Member State authorities to facilitate public 
engagement and public understanding of the value of research for health, including clinical 
trials.
International agencies and non-State actors providing aid in conflict areas should be open 
to the need to conduct or facilitate research benefiting people affected by conflict and 
discrimination, while staying impartial and being careful to support and not undermine 
relevant local health initiatives.
The global community should develop and test new models that could be used successfully 
in the fight against corruption in global health, and funders should support this effort.
All stakeholders should actively reduce unnecessary bureaucracy, ensure transparency—
by means that include the disclosure of conflicts of interest—and accountability in their 
operations, and build capacity for management and accounting where necessary.
Health ministries should aim to strengthen regulatory processes and improve efficiency, by 
means that include allocating adequate funding, and clarifying legal uncertainties. Clinical 
trial agreements, uniform shared templates for material/data transfer agreements and other 
mechanisms enabling researchers to achieve the study objectives within agreed timelines, 
while respecting national guidelines, should be encouraged.
Researchers should improve their communication with local communities, including policy-
makers and clinicians, about the potential benefits of clinical research.
A2.2.2 Building research infrastructure and capacity 
Member States, international organizations and sponsors should support the development 
of local research career structures as well as training schemes in research ethics, research 
methodology, statistical analysis, research practice and clinical data management.
Member States, international organizations and sponsors should invest in creating and 
maintaining local laboratory infrastructure and sample storage resources and associated 
staff capacity to support clinical trials wherever possible. Participation in external quality 
assurance schemes should be encouraged and supported.
Researchers and funders should aim to work together and share their experiences, methods 
and resources.
Regulatory authorities, funders and researchers should collaborate to establish or maintain 
existing clinical research networks.

Guidance for best practices for clinical trials50
Guidance for best practices for clinical trialsA2.2.3 Building research infrastructure and capacity 
Regulatory authorities should consider WHO’s guidance on the high-level principles and 
considerations for good reliance practices in the regulation of medical products, especially 
those in resource-limited settings. 
Regulatory authorities should only require local clinical trials or set other special requirements 
if they are scientifically justified.
Member States and funders should allocate greater financial and human resources for 
training and continuous education about the key scientific and ethical considerations for 
good clinical trials.
A2.2.4 Building research infrastructure and capacity 
Good clinical trials apply standards that are based on key scientific and ethical principles 
and focused on issues that materially matter to the well-being of trial participants and the 
reliability of trial results. Risk-based proportionate approaches should be adopted (see 
Section 2 ).
A2.2.5 Protecting research participants 
Researchers should allocate adequate time and resources for measures and materials to obtain 
properly informed consent. Consent information should be as succinct as possible. Innovative 
options for obtaining informed consent using new technologies, such as audiovisual 
models to ensure better understanding, or electronic consent should be considered where 
appropriate. At all stages of a clinical trial, relevant and easily understandable information 
should be shared with trial participants, with careful balancing of the duty to inform against 
the risk of information saturation and taking account of the clinical context. Information 
should be provided in a clear manner and in suitable languages and formats for the intended 
audiences and avoid legalistic or other technical language.
Patients and communities should be engaged to help to provide valuable contributions to 
the design and execution of clinical trials and interpretation of their results and hence enable 
effective measures to protect research participants’ rights.
A2.2.6 Avoiding exploitative research  
The priority-setting exercise for clinical research should involve relevant local bodies, patients 
and the public and should take into account under-represented groups and people in 
vulnerable situations. Before approving the study, local authorities may want to negotiate 
with the sponsors about how the benefits will be shared with the local population.
Ethical review should consider whether sufficient resources are available at the study site to 
avoid any negative impact on routine patient care.

51
Annex 2. Recommendations for Member States, research funders and researchersResearch projects initiated by sponsors in HICs should be approved by a REC in the host 
country as well the REC in the high-income setting.
Measures should be taken to oppose double standards in research and support long-term 
equitable research relationships between partners in LMICs and HICs.
A2.2.7 Ethical review and capacity-building  
Member States should consider setting up national ethics committees to promote consistency 
and avoid unnecessary duplication of work in regions where several RECs exist. Regions or 
countries should consider having joint RECs or common reviews for multicentre research.
Member States, international organizations and sponsors of research projects should invest in 
capacity-building for RECs in resource-limited settings, including training in scientific research 
and the key scientific and ethical considerations for good clinical trials (as described in 
Section 2 ), training for expedited and rapid reviews, and proportionate risk-based monitoring 
and evaluation.
Review by an REC should be based on the protocol and complete, up-to-date supporting 
information and should include a determination of whether the proposed clinical study is 
scientifically sound, justified, proportionate and risk-based.
RECs should examine their internal processes to reduce unnecessary bureaucracy, streamline 
their functions and harmonize processes with those of other RECs in the country or region. 
Regional or national forums, databases or registries should be encouraged to allow for 
communication and coordination between RECs.
Ethics committees should be empowered to function independently of any institutional, 
external pressure or conflict of interest and to take unbiased decisions.
International initiatives to strengthen ethical review, including those of WHO, should be 
supported.
International organizations, sponsors and funders should make efforts to reduce the language 
barrier in capacity-building by providing documents and organizing events in languages 
other than English.
A2.2.8 Participant and community engagement  
Where necessary, researchers should educate community representatives about what a 
clinical trial is, how it differs from routine health care and the specific protections provided 
for trial participants.
Researchers should develop formal plans on how they will communicate with participants 
and the local community throughout the clinical trial in a meaningful way.
Communities in resource-limited settings should be empowered to negotiate for fair benefits 
of clinical research. This activity will require support by an effective, independent local REC.

Guidance for best practices for clinical trials52
Guidance for best practices for clinical trialsA2.2.9 Conceptualizing and designing research 
Funders and institutions conducting research should recognize the value of information about 
the study population and its importance for assessment of the potential impact and benefit 
of health research. Community engagement may provide access to valuable information.
Research to address the health needs of children and women, including pregnant and 
lactating women, should be viewed as the norm unless there is valid justification to exclude 
them.
Efforts should be made to ensure that clinical trials recruit as diverse and inclusive populations 
as possible.
Both industry-sponsored and academic research in resource-limited settings should focus 
on relevant research questions that will help to address a clear health need
Researchers should consider the use of adaptive study designs and data collection, where 
possible and appropriate.
As a rule, to minimize the burden on the local infrastructure and population, data collection 
should focus on those variables that provide needed scientific information for the study.
Research protocols should be adapted as much as possible to local clinical practice and 
cultural/social considerations, for example regarding frequency of visits and sampling.
Member States, international organizations and sponsors should support education on 
research methodology and study designs in resource-limited settings, as well as building 
the necessary infrastructure.
A2.2.10 Responsible information sharing  
Researchers should minimize the risk of re-identification of individual participants from any 
data that may be shared outside the study and should make both the plans for data-sharing 
and any risk of data identification clear to study participants as part of seeking informed 
consent.
Academic research institutions and hospitals should support appropriate management, 
analysis and publication of clinical research data and results, seeking support for writing and 
translation where necessary.
Funders are encouraged to accommodate the costs of data-related activities when funding 
clinical research.
Funders and sponsors are encouraged to allocate dedicated human resources for 
communicating objective, validated information and research results to participants, 
communities, clinicians and policy-makers before, during and after research, as well as to 
the media and the general public.

Annex 2. Recommendations for Member States, research funders and researchersA2.2.11 Under-represented populations: women of child-bearing age 
More research should be conducted to address the needs of women of child-bearing age, 
including pregnant and lactating women. CIOMS’ ethical guidelines issued in 2016 (14) make a 
compelling case for inclusion of women in research, including pregnant and lactating women. 
The fact that a population is physiologically different should never be a reason to exclude it 
from participation in clinical research where the results may be beneficial to that population, 
so long as everyone involved in the research is aware of the risks involved and appropriate 
safeguards and protective health measures are in place.
Researchers and ethics committees should ensure that the cultural context is respected when 
studies are conducted in women of child-bearing age, including pregnant and lactating 
women.
The establishment and use of pregnancy registries in LMICs should be considered.
A2.2.12 Under-represented populations: children   
Clinical trials in children should be considered from the outset at all stages of clinical 
development.
Clinical studies in children are needed across the spectrum of health care settings, including 
hospitals and communities, including those in remote areas.
More pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies and pharmaceutical formulation 
studies should be conducted to support the development of safe and effective medicines 
for children.
Member States and funders should support initiatives to strengthen regulatory expertise for 
paediatric medicines as well as academic expertise in and capability for conducting paediatric 
clinical trials.
A2.2.13 Under-represented populations: the elderly and very elderly
Clinical trials in the elderly and very elderly should be considered from the outset at all stages 
of clinical development.
Clinical studies in the elderly and very elderly are needed across the spectrum of health care 
settings, including hospitals and communities, including those in remote areas.
More pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies and pharmaceutical formulation 
studies should be conducted to support the development of safe and effective medicines 
for the elderly and very elderly.
Member States and funders should support initiatives to strengthen regulatory expertise for 
medicines for the elderly and very elderly as well as academic expertise in and capability for 
conducting clinical trials in the elderly and very elderly.
