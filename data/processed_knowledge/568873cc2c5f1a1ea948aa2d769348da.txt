METHODS :
Study Design:   This was a randomized (2:1), multicenter, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy  and safety  of SP versus PP in subjects with 
CRPC whose disease failed treatment with a docetaxel -based chemotherap y regimen. 
Subjects remained on study  as long as they  continued to derive clinical benefit and were 
followed for safet y and efficacy  as per the schedule of assessments until death.  Subjects 
discontinuing all treatment prior to disease progression continued to have scheduled disease 
assessments until progression, until the initiation of a subsequent anticancer therap y in the 
absence of documented disease progression, or until death, whichever came first.
A total of 873 subje cts were enrolled in the study .  An interim anal ysis for safet y and futility  
was performed when approximately  400 subject s were enrolled (120 PFS events expected).  
A second int erim analy sis of safet y wasperformed, together with an interim analy sis of 
efficacy  and futility  based on OS, after 819 subject s were enrolled. At that time, an 
estimated 225 OS events had occurred.
The schedule of activities during the stud y is provided in Table 1.

a. Day 1 Cycle 1 assessments:  physical examination, hematol ogy, blood chemistry, PSA, and testosterone did not have to be obtained on Day 1 if screening samples had 
been performed within 7 days.
b. End of treatment/ withdrawal:  these assessments di d not need to be completed if they had been performed within 2 weeks of study withdrawal (within the last 8 weeks 
for tumor assessments, and within the last 4 weeks for PROs).  Subjects discontinuing all treatment prior to disease progress ion were asked t o return to the clinic at 
8-week intervals for disease assessments.
c. Posttreatment follow -up:  subjects discontinuing all treatment prior to disease progression were followed for tumor ass essments until progression, until initiation of a 
subsequent anticancer therapy in the absence of documented progression, or until death, whichever occurred first.  Subjects w ere evaluated for safety up to 28 days after 
the last dose of study treatment. AEs were followed until all serious or study drug -related toxicities had resolved or were determined to be “chronic” or “stable,” 
whichever was later.
d. Informed consent:  must have been o btained prior to undergoing any study specific procedure and might have occurred prior to the 21 -day screening period.
e. Medical/oncological history:  included oncologic history, demographic s, history of other disease processes (active or resolved) and concomitant illnesses.
f. Physical examination:  examination of major body systems.
g. Samples for hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis (protein):  all laboratory assessments were performed by a central la boratory.  Sites could perform additional 
local assays for the purposes of planning treatment administrat ion, dose modification, or monitoring AEs.  A dipstick protein urinalysis was performed at Screening, 
Cycle3 Day 1 (as clinically indicated), and at the end of treatment/withdrawal visit.  If the results of the dipstick test indicated a ≥2+ proteinuria, follow -up was to be 
performed with a quantitative urine protein analysis according to local standard practices.  Thyroid -stimulating hormone was only performed at screening, Cycle 3 Day 1, 
and as clinically indicated thereafter.
h. BSAP and NTX:  assessment of BSAP and serum and urine Type I collagen cross -linked NTX concentrations occurred at Screening, every 8 weeks from the start of 
study drug administration, and at the end of treatment/ withdrawal visit, coinciding with tumor assessments.
i. ECG:  3 consecutive 12 -lead ECGs approximately 2 minutes apart were obtained at Screening and on Cycle 2 Day 1 to determine the mean co rrected QT (QTc) 
interval.  During the study, if the mean QTc interval was prolonged (Grade >1), the ECGs were to be over read by a cardiologi st at the site for confirmation.  Additional 
ECGs could be performed as clinically indicated and following intra subject sunitinib dose adjustments.
j. MUGA scan or echocardiogram (ECHO):  performed at Screening visit and as clinically indicated thereafter.

Follow -up
k. Study registration:  subject number and treatment assignment were obtained via centralized randomization.
l. Study treatment (sunitinib):  subjects received oral daily s unitinib continuously, starting on Cycle 1 Day 1.  One cycle consisted of 28 days.
m. Study treatment (placebo):  subjects received oral daily placebo continuously, starting on Cycle 1 Day 1.   One cycle consisted of 28 days.
n. Study treatment (prednisone):  subjects received prednisone (or prednisolone) orally 5 mg BID continuously, starting on Cycle 1 Day 1.
o. Tumor imaging:  CT or MRI scans of chest, abdomen, and pelvis were performed to assess disease status at Screening, every 8 weeks from the start of study drug 
independent of cycle length, whenever disease p rogression was suspected, to confirm a partial or complete response (at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of 
response), and at the end of treatment/withdrawal visit.  Tumor imaging was to continue on this calendar schedule regardless of any delays in dosing.
p. Bone scan:  bone scan was performed at the same time points as the CT or MRI scans of the chest, abdomen ,and pelvis.  
q. Adverse events:  subjects were followed for AEs from the first day of study treatment until at least 28 days after the last d ose of study treatment, or until all serious or 
study drug -related toxicities were resolved or were determined to be “ chronic” or “stable,” whichever was later.  Serious adverse events were to be monitored and 
reported from the time the subject provided informed consent as described in the protocol.
r. Conc omitant medications/treatments:  concomitant medications and treatments were recorded from 30 days prior to the start of stud y treatment, during the study, and up 
to 28 days after the last dose of study treatment.
s. Study drug compliance:  sunitinib and placebo bottle(s) including any unused capsules were returned at the beginning of every cycle starting at Cycle 2 Day 1 and at the 
end of treatment/withdrawal visit for drug accountability.
t. Post-study survival status:  follow -up survival information was collected by the site via clinic visit or telephone contact every 2 months until death.
u. Sample banking for exploratory research (optional), This research component was entirely optional for the subject and require d a separate consent prior to the collection 
of a blood sample for pharmacogenomics and/or an arc hival tumor sample.
v. mBPI -sf, analgesic use diary, and SSQ:  the mBPI -sf questionnaire and analgesic use diary were completed for the 7 consecutive days prior to the start of each new 
cycle, starting during the screening period (7 days prior to Cycle 1), at each subsequent cycle, and at the end of treatment/with drawal visit.  The SSQ was 
administered in conjunction with the diary on the first day of each 7 -day period of recording, starting with Cycle 1 Day 22 (7 days prior to Cycle 2 Day 1).
w. FACT -P, EQ -5D, and subject’s best guess questionnaires:  subjects completed the FACT -P and EQ -5D at the clinic prior to dosing or othe r clinical activities on every 
Day 1 of each cycle, starting with Cycle 1, and at the end of treatment/withdrawal visit.  At the end of the treatment/withdr awal visit, the subject’s best guess 
questionnaire was completed.

Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion :Male subjects aged 18years or older 
diagnos ed with h istologically  or cy tologicall y confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate with 
performance status 0 or 1, measure dusing the Eastern Cooperative Oncology  Group (ECOG )
performance scal e were enrolled in this study .  Subjects had p rogressive mCRPC after failure 
of docetaxel chemoth erapy  (resistant or intolerant), and had progressive disease that was 
based on prostate -specific antigen (PSA)progression, assessment using Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECI ST),or a positive bone scan.   Subjects who were previousl y
treated with sunitinib , or who had received more than 1 prior chemotherapy  regimen for
metastatic disease , chemotherapy  within 3 weeks, subjects with impending complications 
from bone metastases, ongoing urinary  obstru ction, cardi ac dy sfunction (a value of 
corrected -QT interval >470 msec ),or CNS involvement were excluded. 
Study Treatment:   Sunitinib (starting dose of 37.5 mg/day )/placebo was given on a 
continuous daily  dosing (CDD )regimen for a total of 28 doses per cy cle (a treatment cy cle 
consisted of 4 weeks).  Oral s elf-administration of sunitinib/placebo tookplace on an 
outpatient basis ,once daily  in the mo rning without regard to meals, except on the clinic visit 
days (eg, start of a new cy cle).  Sunitinib could be escalat ed to 50 mg at C ycle 3, provided 
there were no Grade >1 nonhematologic or Grade >2 hematologic toxicities.
Prednisone was administered in both treatment arms as background therapy.  Prednisone was 
given on a C DD regimen of 5 mg twice dail y (BID).  Oral sel f-administration of prednisone 
took place on an outpatient basis, outpatient basis BID with food.  Intrasubject dose 
interruptions and/or reductions were permitted in case a subject had experienced 
unacceptable toxicity  provided that study  discontinuation criteria were not met.
Sunitinib was supplied as capsule and prednisone was supplied as a tablet or as aliquid or 
concentrated solution .
Efficacy and Safety Endpoints:   
The study  was terminated for futility ; therefore, all study  efficacy  findings were re ported in 
an abbreviated report format .Efficacy  anal yses were performed onl y for OS, PFS, and ORR.
Primary  Efficacy  Endpoint :  The primary  efficacy endpoint was OS, defined as the time from 
randomization to date of death due to an y cause.

PFS was the time from randomization to first documentation of objective progressive disease 
(PD) or to death on -study due to any  cause, whichever occur redfirst.  ORR was the percent 
of subject s with confirmed complete response ( CR)or partial response ( PR)according to 
RECI ST, relative to the full analy sis population.  Confirmed responses were those that 
persist edon repeat imaging study  4weeks after initial documentat ion of response. 
Designation of best response of stable disease (SD) require dcriteria to be satisfied at least 
7weeks after randomization.
The secondary  endpoints of pain severit y, health -related quality  of life and prostate 
cancer -specific s ymptoms, and general health status were not anal yzed due to earl y

a. Excep t treatment factor all covariates used backward selection process. Only variables significant at 
10% level were included in the final model.  Covariates included ECOG (0 v s. 1), disease progression 
base (PSA only vs. Radiographic), age ( 65 vs. < 65), E thnicity (white vs. non -white), time from 
initial diagnosis, and number of prior regimens.
b. P-value was from the Cox proportional hazard model for treatm ent comparison controlling for

PFS:  Table 6summarizes PFS (derived I nvestigator ’sassessment) b y treatment.   The 
median PFS was longer in the sunitinib arm (24.1 weeks: 95% CI;23.4, 28.1) than in the 
placebo arm (17.9 weeks : 95% CI ; 15.8, 24.1).  When PFS was adjusted for stratification 
factors (ie, ECOG 0 versus 1, and disease progression based on PSA only  versus 
radiographic progress ion, the hazard ratio was 0.725 (sunitinib v ersus placebo), with a 95% 
CI of 0.591, 0.890 and a p -value of <0.001.  Although there was a high censoring rate for 
PFS (56% and 48% in the sunitinib and placebo arms, respectivel y) these data support longer 
PFS with sunitinib.  The most frequent reason for censoring was being off treatment prior to 
progression andnot followed by  further disease assessments.

of study  medication) and during follow up (ie, after 28 day s of the last dose of stu dy 
medication) is presented in Table 15.  A total of 57 subjects (9.8%) in the sunitinib arm and 
30 subjects (10.5%) in the placebo arm died during the stud y.  A total of 279 subjects 
(48.0%) in the sunitinib arm and 147 subjects (51.6%) in the placebo arm died during follow 
up.  The majority  of deaths was due to disease under study .

Deaths on study are deaths that occurred within 28 days of the last dose of study medication.
Deaths during follow up defined as any death occurring after 28 days of the last dose of study medication. 
Subjects who died may have more than 1 reason for cause of death.
Percentages based on the total number of subjects in the safety population within each treatment arm except 
for ‘Cause of Death’ where it’s on the number of deaths.
One subject (sunitinib) died on study but did not have a Grade 5 event in the database. 
Some subjects died beyond 28 days after the last dose but had Grade 5 events entered in the database 
(sunitinib: 10, placebo: 2).
Two randomized subjects in sunitinib ar m and 1 in placebo arm died on study but were never treated.  
Therefore these subjects were not part of the safety population.
N = number of subjects in the safety population
a. Other causes o f death were listed as pneumonia (2), sepsis (2), cardiopulmonary arrest (2), septic
shock, cardiac -respiratory arrest, suspi cion of cardiac infarction, urosepsis , tarry stool, acute 
myocardial infarction, suspected pulmonary embolism, subdural hemorrhage , and m eningitis.
Laboratory  Results, Vital Signs ,and E CGFindings :  There were no new or unexpected 
findings in the clinical laboratory  data, vital signs, orECG findings.   
CONCLUSIONS:
Median OS was 13.1 and 11.8 months in the sunitinib and placebo arms, respectivel y 
(p>0.05).  The study  failed to meet its primary  efficacy  endpoint (improvement in 
OS).
Median PFS was 24.1 and 17.9 weeks in the sunitinib and placebo arms, respectivel y 
(p<0.001).  There was a high ce nsoring rate for PFS (56% in the sunitinib arm and 
48% in the placebo arm).

Template version 1.0 Page 29ORR was significantly  higher in the sunitinib arm (6% versus 2%, P=0.04).  None of 
the subjects had a CR.
Less back pain and bone pain were reported in the sunitinib arm versus placebo arm: 
back pain (15.3% versus 21.4%), and bone pain (12.0% versus 16.5%).
The safet y profile of sunitinib in this study  was consistent with that reported in the 
labeling for sunitinib malate (S utent ).  No new or unexpected AEs were observed in 
this stu dy.
