# ICH Guidelines Knowledge Base

This directory is intended to store the ICH (International Council for Harmonisation) guidelines, particularly focusing on the efficacy guidelines (E1-E20) as specified in the training plan.

## Guideline Structure

The ICH guidelines are organized into four main categories:
- **Quality Guidelines (Q)**: Chemical and pharmaceutical quality assurance
- **Safety Guidelines (S)**: Safety studies
- **Efficacy Guidelines (E)**: Clinical study design, conduct, safety, and reporting
- **Multidisciplinary Guidelines (M)**: Cross-cutting topics

## Key Efficacy Guidelines

1. **E1**: Clinical Safety for Drugs in Long-Term Treatment
2. **E2**: Pharmacovigilance (A-E subsections cover various aspects)
3. **E3**: Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports
4. **E4**: Dose-Response Studies
5. **E5**: Ethnic Factors
6. **E6**: Good Clinical Practice
7. **E7**: Studies in Geriatric Populations
8. **E8**: General Considerations for Clinical Trials
9. **E9**: Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials
10. **E10**: Choice of Control Group in Clinical Trials
11. **E11**: Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Pediatric Population
12. **E12**: Clinical Evaluation by Therapeutic Category
13. **E14**: Clinical Evaluation of QT/QTc Interval Prolongation
14. **E15**: Pharmacogenomics Definitions and Sample Coding
15. **E16**: Genomic Biomarkers Related to Drug Response
16. **E17**: Multi-Regional Clinical Trials
17. **E18**: Genomic Sampling
18. **E19**: Optimization of Safety Data Collection
19. **E20**: Adaptive Clinical Trials

## Usage Instructions

When downloading ICH guidelines, they should be stored in this directory with clear filenames indicating the guideline number and revision. For example: `ICH_E6_R2_GCP.pdf` for the Good Clinical Practice guideline, revision 2.

The knowledge base system will process these PDFs, extract their content, and make them available for the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system to enhance AI responses.
