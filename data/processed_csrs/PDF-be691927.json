Subjects \ndiscontinuing all treatment prior to disease progression continued to have scheduled disease \nassessments until progression, until the initiation of a subsequent anticancer therapy in the \nabsence of documented disease progression, or until death, whichever came first.\n\nA total of 873 subjects were enrolled in the study.  An interim analysis for safety and futility \nwas performed when approximately 400 subjects were enrolled (120 PFS events expected).  \nA second interim analysis of safety was performed, together with an interim analysis of \nefficacy and futility based on OS, after 819 subjects were enrolled.

Subjects discontinuing all treatment prior to disease progression were asked to return to the clinic at \n8-week intervals for disease assessments.\nPosttreatment follow-up:  subjects discontinuing all treatment prior to disease progression were followed for tumor assessments until progression, until initiation of a \nsubsequent anticancer therapy in the absence of documented progression, or until death, whichever occurred first.  Subjects were evaluated for safety up to 28 days after \nthe last dose of study treatment.  AEs were followed until all serious or study drug-related toxicities had resolved or were determined to be \u201cchronic\u201d or \u201cstable,\u201d \nwhichever was later.\nInformed consent:  must have been obtained prior to undergoing any study specific procedure and might have occurred prior to the 21-day screening period.\nMedical/oncological history:  included oncologic history, demographics, history of other disease processes (active or resolved) and concomitant illnesses.\nPhysical examination:  examination of major body systems.\nSamples for hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis (protein):  all laboratory assessments were performed by a central laboratory.  Sites could perform additional \nlocal assays for the  purposes of planning treatment administration, dose modification, or monitoring AEs.  A dipstick protein urinalysis was performed at Screening, \nCycle 3 Day 1 (as clinically indicated), and at the end of treatment/withdrawal visit.  If the results of the dipstick test indicated a \u22652+ proteinuria, follow-up was to be \nperformed with a quantitative urine protein analysis according to local standard practices.  Thyroid-stimulating hormone was only performed at screening, Cycle 3 Day 1, \nand as clinically indicated thereafter.\nBSAP and NTX:  assessment of BSAP and serum and urine Type I collagen cross-linked NTX concentrations occurred at Screening, every 8 weeks from the start of \nstudy drug administration, and at the end of treatment/withdrawal visit, coinciding with tumor assessments.\nECG:  3 consecutive 12-lead ECGs approximately 2 minutes apart were obtained at Screening and on Cycle 2 Day 1 to determine the mean corrected QT (QTc) \ninterval.  During the study, if the mean QTc interval was prolonged (Grade >1), the ECGs were to be over read by a cardiologist at the site for confirmation.  Additional \nECGs could be performed as clinically indicated and following intrasubject sunitinib dose adjustments.\nMUGA scan or echocardiogram (ECHO):  performed at Screening visit and as clinically indicated thereafter.\n\nb.\n\nc.\n\nd.\ne.\nf.\ng.\n\nh.\n\ni.\n\nj.\n\nTemplate version 1.0\n\nPage 4\n\n090177e18544a014\\Approved\\Approved On: 25-Apr-2014 16:36 \fPublic Disclosure Synopsis\nProtocol A6181120 - 17 April 2014 \u2013 Final\n\nTable 1.\n\nSchedule of Activities\n\nProtocol Activities\n\nScreening\n\nOne Cycle = 4 Weeks (28 Days)\n\nPosttreatment\n\nCycle 1\n\nCycles 2+\n\nk.\nl.\nm.\nn.\no.\n\np.\nq.\n\nr.\n\ns.\n\nt.\nu.\n\nv.\n\nw.\n\n\uf0a321 Days Prior\nto Dosing\n\nDay 1\n(-3)a\n\nDay 15\n(\uf0b13)\n\nDay 1\n(-3)\n\nEnd of Treatment/\nWithdrawalb\n\nPost\nTxc\n\nSurvival\nFollow-up\n\nStudy registration:  subject number and treatment assignment were obtained via centralized randomization.\nStudy treatment (sunitinib):  subjects received oral daily sunitinib continuously, starting on Cycle 1 Day 1.  One cycle consisted of 28 days.\nStudy treatment (placebo):  subjects received oral daily placebo continuously, starting on Cycle 1 Day 1.  One cycle consisted of 28 days.\nStudy treatment (prednisone):  subjects received prednisone (or prednisolone) orally 5 mg BID continuously, starting on Cycle 1 Day 1.\nTumor imaging:  CT or MRI scans of chest, abdomen, and pelvis were performed to assess disease status at Screening, every 8 weeks from the start of study drug \nindependent of cycle length, whenever disease progression was suspected, to confirm a partial or complete response (at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of \nresponse), and at the end of treatment/withdrawal visit.  Tumor imaging was to continue on this calendar schedule regardless of any delays in dosing.\nBone scan:  bone scan was performed at the same time points as the CT or MRI scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  \nAdverse events:  subjects were followed for AEs from the first day of study treatment until at least 28 days after the last dose of study treatment, or until all serious or \nstudy drug-related toxicities were resolved or were determined to be \u201cchronic\u201d or \u201cstable,\u201d whichever was later.  Serious adverse events were to be monitored and \nreported from the time the subject provided informed consent as described in the protocol.\nConcomitant medications/treatments:  concomitant medications and treatments were recorded from 30 days prior to the start of study treatment, during the study, and up \nto 28 days after the last dose of study treatment.\nStudy drug compliance:  sunitinib and placebo bottle(s) including any unused capsules were returned at the beginning of every cycle starting at Cycle 2 Day 1 and at the \nend of treatment/withdrawal visit for drug accountability.\nPost-study survival status:  follow-up survival information was collected by the site via clinic visit or telephone contact every 2 months until death.\nSample banking for exploratory research (optional), This research component was entirely optional for the subject and required a separate consent prior to the collection \nof a blood sample for pharmacogenomics and/or an archival tumor sample.\nmBPI-sf, analgesic use diary, and SSQ:  the mBPI-sf questionnaire and analgesic use diary were completed for the 7 consecutive days prior to the start of each new \ncycle, starting during the screening period (7 days prior to Cycle 1), at each subsequent cycle, and at the end of treatment/withdrawal visit.  The SSQ was \nadministered in conjunction with the diary on the first day of each 7-day period of recording, starting with Cycle 1 Day 22 (7 days prior to Cycle 2 Day 1).\nFACT-P, EQ-5D, and subject\u2019s best guess questionnaires:  subjects completed the FACT-P and EQ-5D at the clinic prior to dosing or other clinical activities on every \nDay 1 of each cycle, starting with Cycle 1, and at the end of treatment/withdrawal visit.  At the end of the treatment/withdrawal visit, the subject\u2019s best guess \nquestionnaire was completed.\n\nTemplate version 1.0\n\nPage 5\n\n090177e18544a014\\Approved\\Approved On: 25-Apr-2014 16:36 \fPublic Disclosure Synopsis\nProtocol A6181120 - 17 April 2014 \u2013 Final\n\nNumber of Subjects (Planned and Analyzed):  A total of 819 subjects were planned for\nenrollment to observe the necessary number of events.  A total of 873 subjects were assigned \nto study treatment and 866 subjects (99.2%) were treated of which 581 subjects were in the \nsunitinib arm and 285 in the placebo arm.\n\nOf 873 subjects, 142 subjects were randomized in the US, 122 in France, 83 in the UK, 60 in \nGermany, 52 in Canada, 49 each in Denmark and Spain, 42 in Italy, 32 in Taiwan, \n31 subjects in China, 28 each in Brazil and Sweden, 23 in Israel, 20 in Slovakia, 18 in \nRepublic of Korea, 16 in Poland, 15 each in Belgium and Portugal, 14 each in Australia and \nCzech Republic, 11 in Peru and 9 in Finland. \n\nDiagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Male subjects aged 18 years or older \ndiagnosed with histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate with \nperformance status 0 or 1, measured using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)\nperformance scale were enrolled in this study.  Subjects had progressive mCRPC after failure \nof docetaxel chemotherapy (resistant or intolerant), and had progressive disease that was \nbased on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression, assessment using Response Evaluation \nCriteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), or a positive bone scan.  Subjects who were previously\ntreated with sunitinib, or who had received more than 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for\nmetastatic disease, chemotherapy within 3 weeks, subjects with impending complications \nfrom bone metastases, ongoing urinary obstruction, cardiac dysfunction (a value of \ncorrected-QT interval >470 msec), or CNS involvement were excluded. \n\nStudy Treatment:  Sunitinib (starting dose of 37.5 mg/day)/placebo was given on a \ncontinuous daily dosing (CDD) regimen for a total of 28 doses per cycle (a treatment cycle \nconsisted of 4 weeks).  Oral self-administration of sunitinib/placebo took place on an \noutpatient basis, once daily in the morning without regard to meals, except on the clinic visit \ndays (eg, start of a new cycle).  Sunitinib could be escalated to 50 mg at Cycle 3, provided \nthere were no Grade >1 nonhematologic or Grade >2 hematologic toxicities.\n\nPrednisone was administered in both treatment arms as background therapy.  Prednisone was \ngiven on a CDD regimen of 5 mg twice daily (BID).  Oral self-administration of prednisone \ntook place on an outpatient basis, outpatient basis BID with food.  Intrasubject dose \ninterruptions and/or reductions were permitted in case a subject had experienced \nunacceptable toxicity provided that study discontinuation criteria were not met.\n\nSunitinib was supplied as capsule and prednisone was supplied as a tablet or as a liquid or \nconcentrated solution.\n\nEfficacy and Safety Endpoints:  \n\nThe study was terminated for futility; therefore, all study efficacy findings were reported in \nan abbreviated report format. Efficacy analyses were performed only for OS, PFS, and ORR.\n\nPrimary Efficacy Endpoint:  The primary efficacy endpoint was OS, defined as the time from \nrandomization to date of death due to any cause.\n\nTemplate version 1.0\n\nPage 6\n\n090177e18544a014\\Approved\\Approved On: 25-Apr-2014 16:36 \fPublic Disclosure Synopsis\nProtocol A6181120 - 17 April 2014 \u2013 Final\n\nSecondary Efficacy Endpoints:  Secondary efficacy endpoints focused on PFS and ORR.  \nPFS was the time from randomization to first documentation of objective progressive disease \n(PD) or to death on-study due to any cause, whichever occurred first.  ORR was the percent \nof subjects with confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to \nRECIST, relative to the full analysis population.  Confirmed responses were those that \npersisted on repeat imaging study \uf0b34 weeks after initial documentation of response. \nDesignation of best response of stable disease (SD) required criteria to be satisfied at least \n7 weeks after randomization.\n\nThe secondary endpoints of pain severity, health-related quality of life and prostate \ncancer-specific symptoms, and general health status were not analyzed due to early \ntermination of the study.\n\nSafety Endpoints:  Type, incidence, severity (graded by the National Cancer Institute \nCommon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE Version 3.0]), timing, \nseriousness, and relatedness of adverse events (AEs) and laboratory abnormalities.\n\nSafety Evaluations:  \n\nAEs:  Assessment of AEs (including adverse drug reactions, worsening of baseline \ntumor-related signs and symptoms, illnesses with onset during the study, exacerbation of \nprevious illnesses, any clinically significant changes in physical examination findings, and \nabnormal objective test findings).\n\nLaboratory Evaluations:  Laboratory evaluations included hematology, blood chemistry, and \nurinalysis.  Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, PSA, and serum and urine Type I collagen \ncross-linked N-telopeptide concentrations were be assessed as markers of tumor activity.  \n\nOther Safety Measures:  Other safety measures included physical examination, vital signs \n(temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate after 5 minutes of rest), ECOG \nperformance status, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), and multiple gated acquisition scan \nor echocardiogram for left ventricular ejection fraction.\n\nStatistical Methods:  \n\nFull Analysis Set (FAS):  The FAS included all subjects who were randomized, with study \ndrug assignment designated according to initial randomization, regardless of whether \nsubjects received study drug according to the randomization schedule, or received a different \ndrug from that to which they were randomized.  The FAS was the primary population for \nevaluating all efficacy endpoints.\n\nSafety Analysis Set:  The safety population consisted of all subjects who had taken at least \n1 dose of study medication.\n\nOS and PFS were summarized using Kaplan-Meier methods and displayed graphically where \nappropriate.  The median event time and corresponding 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) \nfor the median were provided for OS and PFS. The hazard ratio and its 95% CIs were\nestimated.  A stratified log-rank test (1-sided, \uf0a30.025) was used to compare OS and PFS \n\nTemplate version 1.0\n\nPage 7\n\n090177e18544a014\\Approved\\Approved On: 25-Apr-2014 16:36 \fPublic Disclosure Synopsis\nProtocol A6181120 - 17 April 2014 \u2013 Final\n\nbetween the 2 treatment arms stratifying for ECOG status (0 versus 1) and type of disease \nprogression (based on PSA progression only versus radiographic progression).  The Cox \nregression model was used to explore the potential influences of the stratification factors on \nthe primary OS endpoint and PFS.  The ORR was summarized for each treatment arm along \nwith the corresponding exact 2-sided 95% CI using a method based on the F distribution\nodds ratio estimator and used to contrast the treatment effects on response rates.  A point \nestimate and a 2-sided 95% CI were calculated using the normal approximation.  The best \nresponse (CR, PR, SD, or PD) for each subject was summarized by treatment arm. SD was\nalso summarized by <3 months versus \uf0b33 months.\n\nRESULTS:\n\nSubject Disposition and Demography:  Table 2 presents summary of subject disposition \nand subjects analyzed.  A total of 873 subjects were assigned to study treatment, and \n866 subjects (99.2%) were treated with study medication.  Of these, 581 received sunitinib \nand 285 received placebo.
