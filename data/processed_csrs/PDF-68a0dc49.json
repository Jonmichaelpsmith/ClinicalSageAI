It does not establish any rights for any person and is not \n8 \nbinding on FDA or the public.  You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the \n9 \napplicable statutes and regulations.  To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible \n10 \nfor this guidance as listed on the title page.  \n11 \n\nI. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \nFDA is issuing this guidance to comply with section 3612(b)(2) of the Food and Drug Omnibus \n17  Reform Act of 2022 (FDORA), enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023.2 \nFDORA directs FDA to issue guidance describing the processes and practices applicable to \n18 \ninspections of sites and facilities described in section 704(a)(5)(C)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, \n19 \nand Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act),3 to the extent not specified in existing publicly available FDA \n20 \nguides and manuals for such inspections. These establishments4 are inspected under FDA\u2019s \n21 \n22  Bioresearch Monitoring (BIMO) program in accordance with section 704(a)(5) of the FD&C \n23  Act. Specifically, this guidance addresses the following (to the extent not publicly available in \nFDA guides and manuals): the types of records and information required to be provided, best \n24 \npractices for communication between FDA and industry in advance of or during an inspection or \n25 \nrequest for records or other information, and other inspections-related conduct.5 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n\nIn general, FDA\u2019s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. \nInstead, guidances describe the Agency\u2019s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only \n\n1 This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) in cooperation with the Office of \nClinical Policy (OCLiP), the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), the Center for Drug Evaluation \nand Research (CDER), the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), the Center for Tobacco \nProducts (CTP), the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), and the Center for Veterinary Medicine \n(CVM) at the Food and Drug Administration. \n2 FDORA was enacted as title III of Division FF of Public Law No. 117-328 (2022). \n3 Section 704(a)(5) of the FD&C Act clarified FDA\u2019s authority with respect to bioresearch related inspections. \n4 In this guidance, the term \u201cestablishment\u201d includes any entity, person, site, or facility, whether foreign or domestic, \nwithin the scope of section 704(a)(5)(C) of the FD&C Act. \n5 The following two guidances will be withdrawn upon finalization of this guidance (as their substance is superseded \nby this draft guidance and other guidances and related documents described in this draft guidance): \n\u201cInformation Sheet Guidance For IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors: FDA Inspections of Clinical \nInvestigators,\u201d available at  https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/fda-\ninspections-clinical-investigators, and \u201cInformation Sheet Guidance For IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors: \nFDA Institutional Review Board Inspections,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-\nguidance-documents/fda-institutional-review-board-inspections. \n\n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fContains Nonbinding Recommendations \n\nDraft \u2014 Not for Implementation \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\nas recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of \nthe word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but \nnot required. \n\nFDA\u2019s BIMO program is a comprehensive portfolio of programs designed to assess and monitor \nall aspects of the conduct and reporting of FDA-regulated research as well as certain \npostmarketing activities through on-site inspections, investigations,6 and Remote Regulatory \n\n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39  Assessments (RRAs). The BIMO program was established to assess the quality and integrity of \ndata submitted to the Agency in support of regulatory decision-making, as well as to provide for \n40 \nprotection of the rights, safety, and welfare of human trial participants7 and animal subjects \n41 \ninvolved in FDA-regulated research.8  The program assesses compliance with statutory \n42 \nrequirements and FDA\u2019s regulations governing the conduct of nonclinical and clinical studies, \n43 \nand applicable postmarketing activities (e.g., in REMS and PADE).9 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51  Agency\u2019s BIMO inspection authority, section 704(a)(5) includes, among other things, the \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n\nthe establishments subject to BIMO inspection, e.g., those used by sponsors in connection \nwith developing an application or other submission to FDA for marketing authorization, \nor those conducting a study related to such an application or submission; and \nthe records and other information that may be inspected, e.g., information related to the \nconduct, results, and analyses of studies, including those involving human trial \nparticipants or animal subjects. \n\nFDA is authorized at reasonable times to access, inspect, and copy records and other information \nas described in section 704(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 374(a)). The general authority for \nestablishment inspections is found in section 704(a)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 374(a)(1)). \nSection 704(a)(5) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 374(a)(5)), as added by FDORA, clarified10 and \ndetailed the Agency\u2019s authority for conducting BIMO inspections. Specifically, in clarifying the \n\nIt also underscores that those subject to BIMO inspection must provide FDA with access to the \ninformation to be inspected (including access to all paper and electronic records and access to \nelectronic information systems used to hold, analyze, process, or transfer that information), and \n\nfollowing: \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n6 See \u201cBioresearch Monitoring Investigations\u201d under section 8.6 of the \u201cInvestigations Operations Manual,\u201d \navailable at https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/inspection-\nreferences/investigations-operations-manual. \n7 In this document, the term \u201ctrial participant\u201d is used and covers both human trial participants and animal subjects. \n8 The terms \u201cresearch,\u201d \u201ctrial,\u201d and \u201cstudy,\u201d are deemed to be synonymous for purposes of this guidance and include \nboth clinical research (also referred to as \u201cclinical study,\u201d \u201cclinical trial,\u201d and \u201cclinical investigation\u201d) and \nnonclinical research (also referred to as \u201cnonclinical trial\u201d and \u201cnonclinical laboratory study\u201d). \n9 \u201cREMS\u201d refers to Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, see section 505-1 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 355-\n1). \u201cPADE\u201d refers to Postmarketing Adverse Drug Experience, see e.g. 21 CFR 310.305 , 21 CFR 314.80, 21 CFR \n329.100 ,  21 CFR 600.80 , and 21 CFR parts 803 and 806. \n10 See section 704(a)(5)(F) of the FD&C Act. \n\n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n\fContains Nonbinding Recommendations \n\nDraft \u2014 Not for Implementation \n\npermit FDA to inspect relevant facilities and equipment used in generating that information.11 At \nthe same time, section 704(a)(5) makes clear that existing safeguards12 against disclosure of \nconfidential commercial information and trade secrets continue to apply, and that BIMO \ninspections \u2013 like inspections generally \u2013 are to be conducted at reasonable times, within \nreasonable limits, and in a reasonable manner.13 \n\n64 \n65 \n66 \n67 \n68 \n69 \n70  Generally, an inspection, such as described in section 704(a) of the FD&C Act, involves duly \ndesignated officers or employees of FDA physically entering establishments subject to regulation \n71 \nunder the FD&C Act to determine compliance with applicable FDA requirements. FDA also uses \n72 \nother oversight tools when appropriate, such as RRAs. An RRA is an examination of an FDA-\n73 \n74 \nregulated establishment and/or its records, conducted entirely remotely, to evaluate compliance \n75  with applicable FDA requirements. RRAs under the BIMO Program may consist of: (1) Remote \nInteractive Evaluations14 and (2) requests for records or other information under section \n76 \n704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act from sites and facilities subject to inspection under section \n77 \n704(a)(5)(C)(i) (i.e., establishments subject to BIMO inspections) in advance of or in lieu of such \n78 \ninspections.15 \n79 \n80 \n81 \n82 \n83 \n\n11 See section 704(a)(5)(D)(i) of the FD&C Act. \n12 See section 704(a)(5)(D)(ii) of the FD&C Act. \n13 See section 704(a)(5)(D)(iii) of the FD&C Act. Also see Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 website for \ninformation on permissible disclosures of protected health information to public health authorities (including FDA), \navailable at https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/public-health/index.html. \n14 For more information on Remote Interactive Evaluations, see \"Remote Interactive Evaluations of Drug \nManufacturing and Bioresearch Monitoring Facilities Guidance for Industry\" available at \nhttps://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/remote-interactive-evaluations-drug-\nmanufacturing-and-bioresearch-monitoring-facilities. We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version \nof a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-\nguidance-documents. \n15 For more information on RRAs generally, including their applicability to BIMO sites and facilities, \ncommunications between FDA and industry regarding requests for records or other information, and the distinction \nbetween an RRA and inspections under sections 704(a)(1) and 704(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, see \u201cConducting Remote \nRegulatory Assessments Questions and Answers Draft Guidance for Industry\u201d (hereafter, the \u201cDraft RRA \nGuidance\u201d), available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/conducting-\nremote-regulatory-assessments-questions-and-answers. Although an RRA is not an inspection and the Draft RRA \nGuidance notes that the Agency does not intend to conduct an RRA at the same time as an inspection, the Draft \nRRA Guidance provides information about communications between industry and FDA during an RRA that may be \nrelevant for communications during an inspection. Specifically, see the Draft RRA Guidance\u2019s discussion of records \nsecurity, file format (e.g., Portable Document Formats), and language translation. When finalized, that guidance will \nrepresent the Agency\u2019s current thinking on how RRAs apply generally to all FDA-regulated products. For additional \ntranslation guidance, see the draft \u201cTranslation of GLP Study Reports: Questions and Answers\u201d available at \nhttps://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/translation-good-laboratory-practice-\nstudy-reports-questions-and-answers. \n\n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\fContains Nonbinding Recommendations \n\nDraft \u2014 Not for Implementation \n\nPROCESSES AND PRACTICES APPLICABLE TO BIORESEARCH \n\nBIMO Processes and Practices \n\nThe Agency\u2019s processes and practices applicable to BIMO inspections are detailed in \nits Investigations Operations Manual (IOM), compliance programs, and the Regulatory \nProcedures Manual (RPM). In general, for all domestic and foreign BIMO inspections, FDA \nfollows the same processes and practices before and during the inspection, except as noted in this \nguidance. \n\nFDA\u2019s IOM16 is the primary operational reference for FDA investigators and other FDA \npersonnel to perform investigational activities in support of the Agency\u2019s public health mission \nacross all program areas. The BIMO compliance programs were developed to provide uniform \nand specific instructions for FDA personnel. They describe the inspection focus and types of \nrecords and information FDA personnel evaluate to assess compliance with the relevant FDA \nregulations and statutory requirements for each regulated entity or program.17 \n\nA. \n\nIII. \n\n84 \n85  MONITORING INSPECTIONS \n86 \n87 \n88 \n89 \n90 \n91 \n92 \n93 \n94 \n95 \n96 \n97 \n98 \n99 \n100 \n101 \n102 \n103 \n104 \n105 \n106 \n107 \n108 \n109 \n110 \n111 \n112 \n113 \n114 \n115 \n116 \n\nInspections \nInstitutional Review Boards \n\nThese compliance programs include: \n\nIn Vivo Bioavailability-Bioequivalence Studies - Clinical \nIn Vivo Bioavailability-Bioequivalence Studies - Analytical \nInspection of Nonclinical Laboratories Conducting Animal Rule-Specific Studies \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022  Good Laboratory Practice (Nonclinical Laboratories) \n\u2022  Good Laboratory Practice Program (Nonclinical Laboratories) EPA Data Audit \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022  Radioactive Drug Research Committees \n\u2022  Sponsors and Contract Research Organizations \n\u2022  Clinical Investigators and Sponsor-Investigators \n\u2022  Postmarketing Adverse Drug Experience (PADE) Reporting Inspections \n\u2022  Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) Reporting Inspections \n\n16 See \u201cInvestigations Operations Manual,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-\nand-criminal-investigations/inspection-references/investigations-operations-manual.

FDA BIMO inspections generally \ninclude: inspections conducted in support of FDA\u2019s review of specific submissions or marketing \napplications; periodic inspections of establishments with on-going activities, such as nonclinical \nlaboratories or institutional review boards; or inspections conducted to evaluate potential \nnoncompliance or safety issues raised in a complaint or required report (e.g., from IRBs or \nsponsors) pertaining to a study or establishment. Inspections may be comprehensive, covering all \noperations of the establishment, or directed, covering a subset of operations. As explained in Part \nIV below, FDA conducts both announced and unannounced BIMO inspections. \n\nProduct development and marketing are often global pursuits and therefore FDA\u2019s BIMO \ninspections are not limited to the United States. International inspections may be conducted when \nappropriate (e.g., when studies conducted outside the United States are in support of, or \n\nInternational Inspections \n\nTypes of Inspections \n\nC. \n\nB. \n\n18 See \u201cRegulatory Procedures Manual,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-\ncriminal-investigations/compliance-manuals/regulatory-procedures-manual.

During foreign inspections, FDA credentials are \npresented to the top management official (or onsite designee) but FDA does not issue a notice of \ninspection.21 With the exception of this difference and those related to pre-announcement \nprocedures described below22 inspections of foreign and domestic establishments are generally \nthe same in terms of processes and practices. \n\nFDA has issued guidance23 relevant to the conduct of clinical studies, including guidance on \nissues specific to studies conducted internationally.24 FDA also collaborates with certain \ninternational regulatory partner agencies to conduct joint inspections, observe inspections, share \ninspection information and develop policy.25 This collaboration is important to the BIMO \nprogram. \n\nIV. \n\nBEST PRACTICES FOR COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE FDA AND \nINDUSTRY IN ADVANCE OF, DURING, OR AFTER AN INSPECTION \n\nA. \n\nPre-announcement Notice and Communication \n\nThe Agency\u2019s primary purpose for pre-announcing an inspection is to ensure the appropriate \nrecords and establishment personnel will be available during the inspection. FDA may \ncommunicate a general idea of the records that may be requested during the inspection (e.g., \nregarding certain establishment procedures and any associated records). \n\nPre-announcement practices depend on the type of inspectional activity being conducted and are \nexplained in each compliance program.26 During pre-announcement of FDA inspections, FDA \nintends to make reasonable efforts to contact the establishment, including to discuss inspection \nplans, and the inspection start date and time. Pre-announcement communications also include \ndiscussions with the establishment to ensure the availability of relevant establishment staff and \n\n20 See section 5.5 of the IOM. \n21 For additional information on FDA notice of inspection (e.g., Form FDA 482), see \u201cAuthority to Inspect\u201d under \nsection 2.2 of the IOM. See also the Bioresearch Monitoring Program compliance programs. \n22 See Part IV. A Pre-announcement Notice and Communication. \n23 See \u201cSearch for FDA Guidance Documents,\u201d available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-\nguidance-documents. \n24 FDA BIMO inspections include, but are not limited to, studies that are conducted under an FDA investigational \nnew drug application (IND), as well as studies at non-U.S. establishments that are not conducted under an IND, an \ninvestigational new animal drug (INAD) exemption, or under an investigational device exemption (IDE). See, for \nexample, the \u201cInformation Sheet Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, and IRBs: Frequently Asked \nQuestions Statement of Investigator (Form FDA 1572),\u201d discussing foreign clinical studies conducted under an IND \nor as non-IND studies. \n25 FDA may enter into cooperative arrangements and confidentiality commitments to facilitate international \npartnerships with counterpart foreign government agencies. See \u201cInternational Arrangements,\u201d available at \nhttps://www.fda.gov/international-programs/international-arrangements. \n26 See footnote 17 for more on compliance programs.

There may be instances in which FDA investigators may \nnot disclose specific reasons for conducting the inspection during pre-announcement. In such \ncases, if appropriate, FDA investigators may inform the establishment representative that \nadditional details will be shared during the opening meeting of the inspection. \n\nEstablishment staff should also confirm arrival details with FDA investigators and provide a \ncontact phone number. FDA believes that an establishment\u2019s failure to acknowledge the pre-\nannouncement notification should not be a reason to delay the start of an inspection. This pre-\nannouncement notification should be provided within a reasonable time before the inspection is \nscheduled to occur. FDA generally pre-announces both foreign and domestic inspections, but \npre-announcement for foreign inspections is generally further in advance of the inspection due to \ncountry clearance requirements. In general, pre-announcements for domestic inspections will be \ngiven via phone while for foreign inspections pre-announcements may be by phone and/or email. \n\n183 \n184 \n185 \n186 \n187 \n188 \n189 \n190 \n191 \n192 \n193 \n194 \n195 \n196 \n197 \n198 \n199 \n200 \n201 \n202 \n203 \n204 \n205 \n206 \n207 \n208 \n209 \n210  During the pre-announcement, FDA investigators intend to communicate with the establishment \nthe planned timeframe and duration of the inspection, including appropriate working hours \n211 \nduring which the inspection is likely to take place. Inspection duration is impacted by a myriad \n212 \nof factors, such as the complexities of the operations, availability of knowledgeable staff, the \n213 \n214 \nnature of any observations, and if FDA needs to follow-up on complaints received by the \n215  Agency. \n216 \n217 \n218 \n219  When FDA personnel request records or other information as part of an inspection,28 the Agency \n220  will typically provide an opportunity to discuss the nature, process, and timeline of the request. \n221 \n222 \n\nInspections, whether pre-announced or unannounced, are conducted consistent with our \ncompliance programs, the IOM, and applicable statutory authority. The Agency may determine \nto not pre-announce an inspection (foreign or domestic) if prior notification may impact the \ninspection. \n\nThe establishment may ask clarifying questions and should be prepared to provide the records in \na timely manner during the inspection.

Although there is no regulatory requirement for the inspected establishment to  \n249 \nrespond to a Form FDA 483, a timely written response to the Form FDA 483 that includes \n250 \nappropriate corrective and preventive actions could impact FDA\u2019s determination of the need for \n251 \nsubsequent Agency action.

Hard copy responses may be mailed to \nthe address listed on the Form FDA 483 or emailed, with email being the preferred approach.35 It \nis recommended that the respondent include the FDA Establishment Identification (FEI) of the \ninspected location in its correspondence.36 For foreign inspections, if the establishment chooses \nto respond in writing to the observations discussed or listed on the Form FDA 483, the response \nshould be addressed to the FDA center point of contact (POC) provided by the investigator. \n\n256 \n257 \n258 \n259 \n260 \n261 \n262 \n263 \n264 \n265 \n266 \n267 \n268 \n269 \n270  Responses should be well-organized and structured to: \n\u2022  Address each observation separately \n271 \n\u2022  Note whether the establishment agree(s) or disagree(s), and why \n272 \n\u2022  Provide both corrective and preventive actions and timelines for completion \n273 \n\u2022  Provide both completed and planned actions and related timelines \n274 \n\u2022  Provide a method of verifying or monitoring the effectiveness of the actions \n275 \n\u2022  Submit documentation (e.g., training, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), corrective \n276 \n277 \n278 \n279 \n280 \n281 \n282 \n283 \n284 \n285 \n286 \n\nIf an inspected establishment has any questions that the FDA personnel conducting the \ninspection has not answered, the establishment may contact the ORA OBIMO management staff. \nThe FDA investigator who conducted the inspection should be able to provide the name and \ntelephone number of OBIMO division management to the establishment.37 Questions about the \ninspection classification38 can be directed to the FDA center POC identified in the post-\ninspection correspondence or in the relevant compliance program.
