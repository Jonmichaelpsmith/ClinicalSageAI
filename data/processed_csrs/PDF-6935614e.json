The study required 5 in-clinic visits including the screening visit, \nbaseline/enrollment visit, end of Week 4 visit, end of treatment visit (Week 12), and a post \ntreatment visit (Week 16).\n\nNumber of Subjects (Planned and Analyzed): It was estimated that a sample size of \n277 subjects would have been sufficient to provide 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of width \nno more than \uf0b10.38 with 80% coverage probability.  Allowing for a drop-out rate of 15%, a \ntotal of 326 subjects were required to be entered into the study.\n\nAll 331 subjects who were treated were included in the safety analysis set and were analyzed \nfor adverse events (AEs).  One subject was excluded from the full analysis set (FAS) because \nshe did not have any post-baseline efficacy data for any efficacy endpoints.  A total of \n251 subjects (75.8%) were included in the per protocol analysis set (PPAS).\n\nDiagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion:  Eligible subjects were male or female \noutpatients \u226518 years old with OAB symptoms (subject-reported) for \u22653 months prior to \nscreening/Visit 1 according to International Continence Society guidelines, mean urinary \nfrequency of \uf020\u22658 micturitions per 24 hours as verified by the screening bladder diary prior to \nbaseline/Visit 2, and mean number of urgency episodes \u22653 per 24 hours as verified by the \nscreening bladder diary prior to baseline/Visit 2 (urgency episodes were defined as those \nwith urinary sensation scale [USS] rating \u22653).  Subjects with conditions that would \ncontraindicate the usage of fesoterodine or could impact OAB symptoms, history of urinary \ntract surgery, active bladder stones and urinary tract infection were excluded from the study.\n\nStudy Treatment:  All entered subjects were initially treated with fesoterodine 4 mg once \ndaily for the first 4 weeks of treatment.  At the end of Week 4, based upon a discussion \nbetween the subject and the investigator of efficacy and tolerability reported by the subject, \nthe investigator could either increase the dose to 8 mg for those subjects who desired greater \nsymptom improvement and reported good tolerability, or could continue the subject on the \n4 mg dose, for the remaining 8 weeks of the study.  No dose adjustments were allowed \nduring the remaining 8 weeks of the treatment phase of the study.  One tablet was to be taken \nwith water at approximately the same time every day.\n\nEfficacy Evaluations:\n\nBladder Diary:\n\nEach subject was to complete a bladder diary for 3 consecutive days immediately preceding \neach clinic visit to record details of micturitions (frequency, urgency, urgency urinary \nincontinence [UUI]).\n\nPage 2\n\n090177e1816562cb\\Approved\\Approved On: 28-Sep-2010 15:00 090177e1816562cb\\Approved\\Approved On: 28-Sep-2010 15:00 \fPhRMA Web Synopsis\nProtocol A0221058 \u2013 26 August 2010 \u2013 Final\n\nQuestionnaires:\n\nPatient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC) is a self-administered, single-item, validated \nquestionnaire that asked subjects to describe their perception of their bladder-related \nproblems.  The PPBC was administered at screening (Visit 1), baseline (Visit 2), Week 4 \n(Visit 3), Week 12 or early termination (Visit 4), and Week 16 (Visit 5).\n\nUrgency Perception Scale (UPS; formerly referred to as Patient Perception of Urgency Scale) \nis a self-administered, single-item, validated questionnaire that measured the subject\u2019s \nperception of urinary urgency.  It was administered at baseline (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 3),\nand Week 12 or early termination (Visit 4).\n\nThe Overactive Bladder-questionnaire (OAB-q) symptom bother scale consisting of 8 items\nasked the subjects how much they had been bothered by selected bladder symptoms during \nthe past 4 weeks.  It was administered at baseline (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 3), and Week 12 or \nearly termination (Visit 4).\n\nThe King\u2019s Health Questionnaire (KHQ) is a self-administered questionnaire containing \n21 questions that are scored in 9 domains (general health perception, incontinence impact, \nrole limitations, physical limitations, social limitations, personal relationships, emotions, \nsleep/energy, severity of urinary symptoms).  It was administered at baseline (Visit 2), \nWeek 4 (Visit 3), and Week 12 or early termination (Visit 4).\n\nThe International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF) is a\nbrief and comprehensive subject-completed questionnaire containing 6 items for the \nassessment and quantification of incontinence and its impact on QoL.  It was administered at \nbaseline (Visit 2) and at Week 12 or early termination (Visit 4).\n\nThe Benefit, Satisfaction and Willingness to continue (BSW) is a 3-item questionnaire \ndesigned to assess treatment benefit, subject satisfaction with treatment, and subject \nwillingness to continue treatment.  It was administered at Week 12 or early termination\n(Visit 4).\n\nAn initial version of the Self Assessment Goal Achievement (SAGA) questionnaire, before \nthe final validated version was available, was included in the study as an exploratory \nendpoint.  The SAGA questionnaire is a subject-completed, physician-reviewed tool to assess \ntreatment goals and achievement of goals for subjects suffering from OAB and/or other \nurinary tract symptoms. SAGA First Assessment questionnaire was provided to the subjects\nat the end of screening visit, when the investigator took the time to explain the questionnaire.\nThe second part (SAGA Follow-up questionnaire) was provided to the subjects along with \ntheir SAGA First Assessment finalized at baseline (Visit 2) (for reference).\n\nThe Treatment Satisfaction Question (TSQ) is a self-administered, 1-item measure of subject \nsatisfaction for subjects receiving treatment for OAB.  The TSQ was administered at the end \nof study at Week 12 or early termination visit (Visit 4) to assess subject\u2019s satisfaction with \ncurrent treatment of fesoterodine.\n\nPage 3\n\n090177e1816562cb\\Approved\\Approved On: 28-Sep-2010 15:00 090177e1816562cb\\Approved\\Approved On: 28-Sep-2010 15:00 \fPhRMA Web Synopsis\nProtocol A0221058 \u2013 26 August 2010 \u2013 Final\n\nSafety Evaluations:  AEs were monitored throughout the study. A urine dipstick test for red \nblood cells, white blood cells, glucose, protein, and nitrites was performed only at the \nscreening visit for assessment of study entry qualification.  A urine pregnancy test \n(beta-human chorionic gonadotropin) was done for women of child bearing potential at \nscreening visit for assessment of study inclusion criteria and at Week 12 (end of treatment \nvisit).  Sitting blood pressure and pulse rate were recorded at all visits including screening, \nbaseline, Week 4, and Week 12 or early termination visit.\n\nStatistical Methods:  All efficacy parameters were analyzed within the FAS.  In addition, \nthe primary efficacy endpoint was also analyzed using the PPAS.\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was the change in mean number of micturitions (micturition \nfrequency [MF]) per 24 hours at Week 12 relative to baseline.  The mean MF per 24 hours \nwas calculated as the sum of all micturitions divided by the total number of diary days \ncollected at that visit.  The primary endpoint was summarized using descriptive statistics, \nwhich included the number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, \nmaximum and 95% CI.\n\nThe secondary efficacy endpoints based on the bladder diary were: \n\n\uf0b7\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\uf0b7\n\nchange in mean MF per 24 hours at Week 4 relative to baseline\n\npercent change in MF at Weeks 4 and 12 relative to baseline\n\nchange and percent change in mean number of nocturnal micturitions (nocturnal \nmicturition frequency [NMF]) per 24 hours at Weeks 4 and 12 relative to baseline in \nsubjects with >0 episodes during the 3-day baseline diary period\n\nchange and percent change in mean number of UUI episodes per 24 hours at Weeks 4 and \n12 relative to baseline in subjects with >0 UUI episodes during the 3-day baseline diary \nperiod\n\nchange and percent change in mean number of urgency episodes (urgency episode \nfrequency [UEF]) per 24 hours at Weeks 4 and 12 relative to baseline\n\nchange and percent change in mean number of nocturnal urgency episodes (nocturnal \nurgency episode frequency [NUEF]) per 24 hours at Weeks 4 and 12 relative to baseline \nin subjects with >0 episodes during the 3-day baseline diary period\n\nchange and percent change in mean number of severe urgency episodes (severe urgency \nepisode frequency [SUEF]) per 24 hours at Weeks 4 and 12 relative to baseline in \nsubjects with >0 episodes during the 3-day baseline diary period\n\nchange in mean number of incontinence pads used per 24 hours at Weeks 4 and 12 \nrelative to baseline.\n\nTo support the interpretation of the primary analysis, a secondary analysis on the primary \nendpoint similar to the primary analysis was to be conducted based upon the PPAS.

Frequency \ntables and change from baseline frequency tables were also presented.  Frequency tables for \nthe UPS categories at each visit and change from baseline to Week 4 and Week 12 frequency \ntables were presented.  The change in the symptom severity/bother items and total of the \nOAB-q symptom bother scale at Week 4 and Week 12 relative to baseline was summarized.  \nAbsolute values and changes from baseline at Week 12 for each domain of the KHQ were \nsummarized.  The changes from baseline in item scores of the ICIQ-SF at Week 12 were \nsummarized.  Each item of the BSW and the total score at Week 12 were summarized.  For \nthe single item measure of satisfaction from the TSQ, the score (very dissatisfied to very \nsatisfied) at Week 12 was summarized descriptively.  In addition, the percentage of \nresponders (ie, subjects who indicated being \u2018Very satisfied\u2019 or \u2018Somewhat satisfied\u2019) was \nsummarized at Week 12.\n\nEndpoints based on changes (absolute or percentage) from Week 12 (end of treatment) to \nWeek 16 were evaluated for exploratory analyses.\n\nThe proportion of subjects escalating from fesoterodine 4 mg to fesoterodine 8 mg at Week 4 \nwas summarized.  Logistic regression analysis was used to explore the relationship between \nthe final dose of fesoterodine (ie, whether subjects escalated to 8 mg or not) and \nscreening/baseline factors, and other covariates, as follows:\n\n\uf0b7 Baseline mean number of micturitions per 24 hours\n\nPage 5\n\n090177e1816562cb\\Approved\\Approved On: 28-Sep-2010 15:00 090177e1816562cb\\Approved\\Approved On: 28-Sep-2010 15:00 \fPhRMA Web Synopsis\nProtocol A0221058 \u2013 26 August 2010 \u2013 Final\n\n\uf0b7 Change in mean number of micturitions per 24 hours at Week 4 relative to baseline\n\n\uf0b7 PPBC score at Week 4\n\n\uf0b7 OABwet (at least 1 incontinence episode per 24 hours at baseline) vs OABdry (no \n\nincontinence episodes per 24 hours at baseline)\n\n\uf0b7 Age\n\n\uf0b7 Gender\n\n\uf0b7 BMI\n\n\uf0b7 Duration of OAB from the date of onset\n\n\uf0b7 Presence/absence of anticholinergic AEs prior to Week 4\n\nFor the purposes of this analysis, the PPBC responses at Week 4 were categorized into \u2018no \nproblems/some very minor problems\u2019, \u2018some minor problems\u2019, \u2018some moderate problems\u2019 \nand \u2018severe problems/many severe problems\u2019.

Response to the \nPPBC Questionnaire at Week 4 gave different results for the sub-group that titrated to \nfesoterodine 8 mg compared to the sub-group that did not; eg, of the subjects who were \ntitrated, 50 subjects (25.6%) had positive responses to \u2018My bladder condition causes me \nsevere problems\u2019 compared to 1 (0.9%) of the subjects who were not titrated.  Subjects who \nwere titrated had more micturitions per 24 hours at Week 4 (mean=13.4; SD=3.75) than \nthose who were not (mean=11.9; SD=2.98).\n\nThe most important goals at baseline, as identified by subjects in the SAGA questionnaire,\nwere \u2018Reduce the sudden need to rush to the bathroom\u2019, \u2018Reduce frequency to the bathroom \nthrough the day\u2019 and \u2018Reduce frequency to the bathroom at night\u2019.  The most frequently \nachieved goals at Week 12 were \u2018Reduce difficulty starting or maintaining a urinary stream\u2019, \n\u2018Reduce frequency to the bathroom through the day\u2019 and \u2018Reduce my urine leakage\u2019.  Nearly \n50% of subjects (49.5%) achieved the goal that was rated \u2018Most Important Goal\u2019, and 81.0% \n\u2018Somewhat achieved goals\u2019 or better.\n\nBenefit of treatment with fesoterodine, was generally observed across all subjects for Fixed \nTotal Score, Global Total Score, as well as OAB symptom-related Fixed Total Score and \nGlobal Total Score - derived from the SAGA questionnaire.  The mean scores at Week 12 \nranged between 47.62 and 48.63.\n\nAs per the TSQ, the majority of subjects reported satisfaction with the OAB medication \n(fesoterodine).  There was a high correlation between the SAGA questionnaire (overall \nachievement of goals) and the TSQ.\n\nSafety Results:  An overview of AE experience during the study is provided in Table 3.  A \ntotal of 605 AEs were reported by 254 subjects, and 295 AEs reported by 159 subjects were \nconsidered treatment-related.  The most commonly reported all-causality AEs were dry \nmouth (99 subjects [29.9%]), constipation (30 subjects [9.1%]) and diarrhea (29 subjects \n[8.8%]) (Table 4).

The corporate safety database was a separate, centralized, adverse \nevent monitoring database that was continuously updated based on rapidly communicated reports from the \ninvestigators to the sponsor.  The clinical study database was based on information provided from the \nCRFs/DCTs.  Consequently, occasional differences in data may exist between the centralized safety database \nand the clinical study database.\nF=female; M=male; NA=not available or not applicable\na Post-therapy.\n\nMean changes from baseline in sitting systolic blood pressure, sitting diastolic blood \npressure, and sitting pulse rate were small.  Nine subjects (2.8%) had an increase in sitting \nsystolic blood pressure \u226530 mm Hg, and 7 subjects (2.1%) had an increase in sitting diastolic \nblood pressure \u226520 mm Hg.  Five subjects experienced increased blood pressure during the \nstudy, which was reported as an AE; 1 subject experienced increased blood pressure that was \nreported as a treatment-related AE.  There were no other safety concerns for vital signs.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\n\n\uf0b7 The primary objective was to demonstrate the efficacy of 12 weeks flexible dose \n\nfesoterodine in subjects with OAB, in terms of a reduction from baseline in MF, and as a \nsecondary objective, in terms of reductions in bladder diary variables (NMF, UUI, UEF, \nNUEF and SUEF).  Results demonstrated that fesoterodine was efficacious in reducing \nMF and other bladder diary variables from baseline to Week 12.\n\nPage 13\n\n090177e1816562cb\\Approved\\Approved On: 28-Sep-2010 15:00 090177e1816562cb\\Approved\\Approved On: 28-Sep-2010 15:00 \fPhRMA Web Synopsis\nProtocol A0221058 \u2013 26 August 2010 \u2013 Final\n\n\uf0b7 The assessment of the effect of flexible dose fesoterodine on treatment satisfaction and \n\nhealth-related QoL measures at 12 weeks compared to baseline showed that the majority \nof subjects were satisfied with their treatment.\n\n\uf0b7 A flexible dose regime of fesoterodine was safe and well tolerated.  Overall, the safety \ndata were consistent to those observed in prior fesoterodine studies and reported in the \nlabel for the OAB population:\n\n\uf0b7 The most commonly reported all-causality AEs were dry mouth, constipation and \ndiarrhea; which are generally expected for this compound and population.  There \nwere no reported events of urinary retention.\n\n\uf0b7 Twenty-nine subjects (8.8%) experienced AEs that led to permanent study \n\ndiscontinuation; for 25 subjects (7.6%) AEs were considered treatment-related.\n\n\uf0b7 Eleven subjects (3.3%) experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent SAE, including \n\n3 subjects who experienced treatment-related SAEs.  All SAEs resolved by the end of \nthe study with the exception of 1 SAE which was fatal.\n\n\uf0b7 Exploratory analyses to understand the impact of cessation of fesoterodine after 12 weeks \n\nof therapy showed that for all micturition diary variables there were deteriorations \n(increases in frequency) after Week 12, ie, after the last dose of fesoterodine was taken.\n\n\uf0b7 Exploratory analysis of dose titration data showed that the 2 factors that were most \n\nstrongly associated with titration from fesoterodine 4 mg to fesoterodine 8 mg at Week 4 \nwere change from baseline in MF and subject response to the PPBC questionnaire at \nWeek 4. \n\n\uf0b7 The exploratory SAGA questionnaire, used in this study to evaluate subjects\u2019 treatment \ngoals with regard to their bladder problems, showed that 49.5% of subjects achieved the \ngoal that was rated \u2018Most Important Goal\u2019, and 81.0% \u2018Somewhat achieved goals\u2019 or \nbetter.  \n\nPage 14\n\n090177e1816562cb\\Approved\\Approved On: 28-Sep-2010 15:00 090177e1816562cb\\Approved\\Approved On: 28-Sep-2010 15:00 \f",
