Subjects \nwith possible IA were enrolled in the study.  However, these subjects were required to have a \nproven or probable diagnosis established within 7 days of enrollment.  Subjects were \nstratified at study entry for host and transplant variables known to have an independent \nimpact on the probability of death due to IA; these included: 1) allogeneic HSCT versus \nother; and 2) pulmonary IA versus other.  \n\nSubjects were to receive a total of 6 weeks of therapy.  Subjects were randomized to 1 of \n2 treatment arms: voriconazole and placebo for anidulafungin or voriconazole and active \nanidulafungin.  After 2 weeks, the Investigator had the option of either continuing the \nsubject\u2019s initial treatment regimen or switching the subject to voriconazole monotherapy.  \nSubjects who were switched to voriconazole monotherapy had to demonstrate improvement \nin presenting clinical signs and symptoms and stable or improved radiographic response.  For \nthe final 2 weeks of treatment, all subjects received voriconazole monotherapy.\n\nVoriconazole was to be administered in the intravenous (IV) formulation for the first week of \ntherapy.  Subsequently, subjects could be switched between IV and oral voriconazole at the \ndiscretion of the Investigator.  Anidulafungin and anidulafungin placebo were administered \nIV.\n\nAssessments of response to treatment were performed every 2 weeks during the study. \nOutcomes were assessed after 6 weeks of antifungal therapy.  All-cause mortality was also \nassessed at the 12-week time point.  The comparative design enabled evaluation of efficacy, \nsafety, and tolerability of the combination regimen in a blinded, unbiased fashion.

Anidulafungin/placebo was preferred to be administered ahead of voriconazole in this subset.\nFor subjects who were receiving voriconazole prophylaxis only at the time of study entry (these subjects must have had proven or probable invasive \naspergillosis to be enrolled).  This specimen collected at the baseline visit (before the start of therapy) was to be used to assess prestudy voriconazole level \nonly and was not included as part of the pharmacokinetic analysis.  The timing of the last dose of voriconazole prophylaxis received was to be recorded in \nthe case report form.\nRecommended for all subjects to facilitate voriconazole dose adjustment: a blood sample for voriconazole measurement was to be collected at the end of \nintravenous voriconazole infusion on Day 3, and another blood sample was to be collected at approximately 1 to 2 hours after oral dosing on the third day \nafter switching to oral voriconazole therapy.

A total of 481 subjects were screened for participation in the study, of which \n459 subjects were randomized to receive study treatment.  A total of 454 subjects were \ntreated and analyzed.\n\nDiagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion:  Male and female subjects aged 16 years and\nolder who were in immunocompromised state due to either receipt of hematopoeitic stem cell \ntransplantation or hematologic malignancy and who had been diagnosed with proven, \nprobable, or possible IA.\n\nStudy Treatment:  Voriconazole, which was administered open-label, was supplied by local \nsites or by the study sponsor.  Anidulafungin (lyophilized) and its companion diluents were \nsupplied by the study sponsor and administered in a blinded manner.  Subjects randomized to \nreceive placebo for anidulafungin were infused IV with the contents of a stock infusion bag \nor bottle provided by each site.\n\nOverall, subjects received 6 weeks of antifungal therapy.  During the first 2 weeks of therapy, \nsubjects randomized to the combination treatment group received voriconazole and \nanidulafungin.  The dose for anidulafungin for all subjects was 200 mg IV on Day 1, \nfollowed by 100 mg IV once daily (QD) thereafter.  Anidulafungin and placebo for \nanidulafungin were administered IV.  During the first 2 weeks of therapy, subjects \nrandomized to the voriconazole treatment group received voriconazole and placebo for \nanidulafungin.  The placebo for anidulafungin was administered QD during the initial 2-week \ntreatment period.\n\nAll subjects received IV or oral voriconazole and were treated with an initial loading dose \nand a subsequent maintenance dose based on body weight.  IV voriconazole (200 mg IV \ninfusion/vial) was required for all subjects during the first week of therapy.  Subjects could \nsubsequently switch to oral voriconazole (40 mg/mL suspension or 50 mg and 200 mg \ntablets), at the discretion of the Investigator after the first week.  For subjects with estimated \ncreatinine clearance <50 mL/minute, oral voriconazole was recommended after the initial \n1-week treatment with IV voriconazole.\n\nDuring the final 2 weeks of treatment, all subjects received maintenance voriconazole \nmonotherapy.\n\nAnidulafungin and anidulafungin placebo were to be administered within 2 hours before or \nafter the scheduled administration time.  Voriconazole was to be administered within 1 hour \nbefore or after the scheduled administration time.  IV infusions of anidulafungin and \nvoriconazole were administered sequentially.\n\nEfficacy and Safety Endpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint:\n\nThe primary endpoint was all-cause mortality, measured 6 weeks after initiation of study \ndrug in subjects with proven or probable IA.\n\nTemplate version 1.0 \n\nPage 5\n\n090177e18544e5fa\\Approved\\Approved On: 25-Apr-2014 20:55 \fPublic Disclosure Synopsis\nProtocol A8851009 \u2013 09 April 2014 \u2013 Final\n\nSecondary Endpoints:\n\n\uf0b7 Rate of global response at 6 weeks;\n\n\uf0b7 All-cause mortality at 6 weeks in subjects with possible, probable or proven IA (ITT \n\npopulation);\n\n\uf0b7 All-cause mortality at 12 weeks in subjects with probable or proven IA;\n\n\uf0b7 Mortality due to IA at 6 weeks; \n\n\uf0b7 Time to death (all-cause mortality);\n\n\uf0b7 Time to death due to IA;\n\n\uf0b7 Safety and tolerability of voriconazole monotherapy compared to that of voriconazole in \n\ncombination with anidulafungin.\n\nSafety Evaluations:  Safety evaluations included adverse events (AEs), laboratory \nevaluations, and ophthalmological assessments.\n\nStatistical Methods:  The modified intent-to-treat (MITT) population was defined to be the \nset of all randomized subjects with proven or probable IA confirmed by Day 7 following \nenrollment, who had received at least 1 dose of study medication.  The MITT population was \nthe primary efficacy analysis population.  The ITT and Per-Protocol (PP) populations were \nused in additional supportive analyses of efficacy.\n\nThe ITT analysis set consisted of the subjects in the MITT analysis set plus subjects with \npossible IA who could not be upgraded to probable or proven IA within 7 days and who had \nreceived at least 1 dose of study medication.  The PP analysis set consisted of the subjects in \nthe MITT population who had completed at least 2 weeks of study therapy, and it excluded \nthose subjects with protocol violations that could have had an impact on the efficacy \nendpoints.  Subjects who died within 2 weeks of starting on study therapy were included in \nthe PP analysis set.\n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) product limit \nestimator on Day 42 (6 weeks) within each stratum and weighted by the harmonic mean of \nthe sample sizes in the strata.  Time to death (T) was measured from the first dose of study \nmedication in days, where T = (date of death \u2013 first treatment date + 1).\n\nFor secondary endpoints, rate of global response, defined as the number of subjects with a \nsuccessful response (\u201ccomplete\u201d or \u201cpartial\u201d global response as adjudicated by the data \nreview committee [DRC]), was calculated as a percentage of all subjects (including subjects \nwith \u201cmissing\u201d response), at 6 weeks.  Investigators also recorded a global response.  Global \nresponse was programmatically determined as follows:\n\nSuccess: A subject who achieved a \u201ccomplete\u201d or \u201cpartial\u201d global response was categorized \nas a successful response;  Failure: A subject was categorized as an unsuccessful response if \n\nTemplate version 1.0 \n\nPage 6\n\n090177e18544e5fa\\Approved\\Approved On: 25-Apr-2014 20:55 \fPublic Disclosure Synopsis\nProtocol A8851009 \u2013 09 April 2014 \u2013 Final\n\nglobal response was \u201cstable\u201d or \u201cfailure\u201d or if there was either a clinical failure or \nradiological failure.\n\nAll-cause mortality at 6 weeks in subjects with possible, probable, or proven IA, was \ncalculated using the KM product limit estimator at Day 42 (Week 6).  All-cause mortality at \n12 weeks in subjects with probable or proven IA, was calculated using the KM product limit \nestimator at Day 84 (Week 12).  Mortality due to IA at 6 weeks in subjects with probable or \nproven IA:  Cause of death for this analysis was determined by the DRC.  Subjects who died \nfor causes other than IA before 6 weeks were censored at their time of death in this analysis.  \nThe mortality rates were calculated using the KM product limit estimator at Day 42 \n(Week 6).  Time to death due to IA:  Cause of death for this analysis was determined by the \nDRC.  Subjects who died for causes other than IA were defined as censored at time of death.\n\nThe analysis of time-to-event endpoints was performed using the Cox proportional hazards \nmodel to calculate a meaningful summary parameter (hazard ratio).  The model included \nterms for treatment group and randomization stratum.\n\nThe safety analysis set consisted of randomized subjects who took at least 1 dose of study \nmedication.  No formal statistical analyses were planned for safety data.  The safety \nendpoints were listed and summarized using descriptive statistics.\n\nRESULTS\n\nSubject Disposition and Demography:  A summary of subject disposition is presented in \nTable 2.\n\nTemplate version 1.0 \n\nPage 7\n\n090177e18544e5fa\\Approved\\Approved On: 25-Apr-2014 20:55 \fPublic Disclosure Synopsis\nProtocol A8851009 \u2013 09 April 2014 \u2013 Final\n\nTable 2.\n\nSubject Disposition\n\nNumber (%) of Subjects\nScreened (N=481)\nAssigned to study treatment\n\nTreated\nCompleted study\nDiscontinued study\nSubject died\nNot related to study drug\nLost to follow-up\nOther\nSubject no longer willing to participate\n\nCompleted treatment\nDiscontinued treatment\n\nSubject died\nRelated to study drug\nAdverse event\nLack of efficacy\nNot related to study drug\nAdverse event\nGlobal deterioration of health status\nOthera\nProtocol violation\nSubject no longer willing to participate\nSubject refused continued treatment \nfor reason other than adverse event\n\nVoriconazole/\nAnidulafungin\n\nVoriconazole/\nPlacebo\n\nTotal\n\n230\n228 (100.0)\n154 (67.5)\n74 (32.5)\n68 (29.8)\n6 (2.6)\n0\n0\n6 (2.6)\n101 (44.3)\n127 (55.7)\n15 (6.6)\n48 (21.1)\n38 (16.7)\n10 (4.4)\n64 (28.1)\n0\n3 (1.3)\n55 (24.1)\n0\n4 (1.8)\n2 (0.9)\n\n229\n226 (100.0)\n146 (64.6)\n80 (35.4)\n71 (31.4)\n9 (4.0)\n2 (0.9)\n1 (0.4)\n6 (2.7)\n98 (43.4)\n128 (56.6)\n15 (6.6)\n45 (19.9)\n34 (15.0)\n11 (4.9)\n68 (30.1)\n1 (0.4)\n4 (1.8)\n56 (24.8)\n1 (0.4)\n5 (2.2)\n1 (0.4)\n\n459\n454 (100.0)\n300 (66.1)\n154 (33.9)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n199 (43.8)\n255 (56.2)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\nDiscontinuations occurring outside of the lag period were attributed to the last study treatment received.\nN = number of subjects.\na.

Of the prespecified subgroup analyses, statistically significant \nlower mortality in the voriconazole/anidulafungin group was observed in the subgroup of \nsubjects who were non-neutropenic at Baseline.  For other subgroups, the differences \nwere not statistically significant.\n\n\uf0b7 DRC-adjudicated global response in the MITT population at Week 6 was successful in \n\n32.6% of the subjects in the voriconazole/anidulafungin group and 43.0% of the subjects \nin the voriconazole/placebo group, with the trend in favor of monotherapy.
