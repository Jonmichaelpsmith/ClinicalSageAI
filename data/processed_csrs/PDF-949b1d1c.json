The \npurpose is to make clinical trials more flexible, efficient and fast. \nEnrichment designs are intended to increase the efficiency of \ndrug development and support precision medicine by tailoring \ntreatments to those patients who will benefit based on clinical, \nlaboratory, genomic, and proteomic factors. \nA master protocol is an overarching protocol designed to answer \nmultiple questions. Master protocols may involve one or more \ninterventions in multiple diseases or a single disease, as defined \nby current disease classification, with multiple interventions, each \ntargeting a biomarker-defined population or disease subtype. \nAn Umbrella studies multiple investigational drugs administered \nas single drug combinations in a single disease population. [Ref \nFDA Guidance on master Protocols]. \nThe trial may include patient sub-grouping and sub-group specific \ntreatments but that is not an essential aspect of an umbrella trial. \nA basket trial studies a single therapy in multiple diseases or \ndisease subtypes (such as disease age, histology\u2019s, genetic or \nother biomarkers) [Ref FDA Guidance on Master Protocols].  \nA platform trial studies multiple therapies in a single disease in a \nperpetual and open-ended manner, with treatments leaving the \ntrial when complete and new ones entering the trial when they \nbecome available and there is room in the trial to accommodate \nthem. \nOld data is used to compare with new data from new trials. \nInformation is essentially \u201cborrowed\u201d from historical data. \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\nCommonly used Acronyms \nCER \n\nComparative Effectiveness Research \n\nCREG   \n\nCHMP  \n\nCRM   \n\nCTA \n\nClinical Research Expert Group \n\nCommittee for Medicinal Products for Human Use \n\nContinuous Re-Assessment Method \n\nClinical Trial Application \n\nCTFG   \n\nClinical Trials Facilitation Group \n\nDIA \n\n  Drug Information Association \n\nDMC   \n\n  Data Monitoring Committee \n\nEFPIA  \n\nEMA   \n\nEU  \n\nEuropean Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations \n\nEuropean Medicines Agency \n\nEuropean \n\nEUnetHTA  European network for Health Technology Assessment  \n\nFDA \n\nHTA \n\nIMI \n\nIMP \n\nFood and Drug Association \n\n  Health Technology Assessment \n\nInnovative Medicines Initiative \n\nInvestigational Medicinal Product \n\nIMPD   \n\nInvestigational Medicinal Product Dossier \n\nMAMS \n\n  Multi-Arm Multi-Stage \n\nPDUFA \n\nPrescription Drug User Fee Act \n\nPhRMA \n\nPharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America \n\nPSoC   \n\nPlacebo Standard of Care \n\nRAR \n\nRCT \n\nUSA \n\n  Response Adaptive Randomisation \n\n  Randomised Controlled Trial \n\n  United States of America \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\nContents \n\nCommonly used Acronyms ........................................................................................................... 4 \n\nExecutive Summary .......................................................................................................................... 7 \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\nIntroduction .............................................................................................................................. 8 \n\nEnrichment Strategies ............................................................................................................. 10 \n\n2.1 Definitions ............................................................................................................................ 10 \n\n2.2 Pre-randomization run in periods ......................................................................................... 11 \n\n2.4 Predictive enrichment ........................................................................................................... 11 \n\n2.5 Genomic biomarkers in oncology .......................................................................................... 12 \n\n2.6 Design issues ......................................................................................................................... 12 \n\n2.7 Biomarker qualification and companion diagnostic co-development ................................... 12 \n\n3.

Regulatory agencies are \nincreasingly supporting the use of complex trials with a number of guidelines and/or reflection \npapers emerging.  This white paper is a landscape review of innovation in clinical trial design, on \nbehalf of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) Clinical \nResearch Expert Group (CREG).  The primary focus is on enrichment designs, adaptive designs, \nmaster protocols and the use of historical controls in clinical trials.  Key findings include: \n\nEnrichment designs Using enrichment designs for drug approval and/or companion diagnostics \napprovals is very attractive but challenging and success will depend on how much prior knowledge \nand biological rationale are available before starting pivotal trials.  Key uncertainties include whether \nthe proposed enrichment will yield positive outcomes (e.g. have we enriched for the right thing) and \nscreening test performance (e.g. can the test be implemented in routine clinical practice), and \nregulatory/Health Technology Assessment (HTA) agencies\u2019 acceptance of the enrichment strategy. \n\nAdaptive designs Adaptations can play a key role in the success of clinical trials if properly pre-\nplanned.  Interim analyses can also enable stopping of trials for futility and efficacy.  Key advantages \ninclude statistical efficiency, improved treatment for the subjects in the trial, and improved \nunderstanding of new drug effects.  Key uncertainties include Type I error rate control, trial integrity, \nand acceptability to all stakeholders of the evidence generated. Engaging in early dialogue with \nregulators and HTA agencies can help to reduce some uncertainties and align on evidence \ngeneration requirements.   \n\nMaster protocols A master protocol incorporates efficient approaches in clinical trial design enabling \nmultiple questions on different treatment options to be answered in a single study and thus \naccelerate clinical development.  The high complexity of these trial designs requires sophisticated \nstatistical methods to ensure proper randomization, interim analysis and robust criteria for \nsuccess/futility assessment of each trial arm. Early involvement of regulators, HTA agencies, ethics \ncommittees, investigators and patients is essential to ensure any concerns on the design can be \naddressed. In Europe, an opportunity for multi-national Pre-CTA consultations would be \nadvantageous to explain the master protocol rationale prior to submission.  Describing the proposed \ndesign in a cover letter for the trial application will aid the understanding of the clinical trial design. \n\nUse of historical controls The use of previous control data to support pre and/or post-licensing \nstrategy should be identified early in the clinical development plan and revisited regularly.  Where \nhistorical data will be used in a clinical trial its use needs to be justified, in particular, how the data \nwere selected, taking into account the disease, population, regulatory and scientific considerations.     \n\nWider stakeholder engagement, in particular regulators and HTA agencies, is needed to understand \nif data generated from innovative and more complex trial designs will be acceptable for both \nregulatory and reimbursement decision making.  In the future the opportunity to develop an \nimproved process for discussing complex designs with multiple stakeholders prior to the initiation of \na study would be advantageous. \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n\fEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\n1. Introduction \n\nIn the Pharmaceutical Industry, clinical trials form an essential part of a drug development program \nfor a new medicine.  Given the burden for patients participating in clinical trials, the time and \nnumber of patients required to complete all the phases of drug development, and the high risks and \ncosts of failure at each phase, there has been a focus in recent years to use novel and innovative \nclinical trial designs throughout all phases of drug development.  The aim of this is to accelerate \npatient access to new medicines and improve the efficiency and the success rate of clinical trials.   \n\nThe Clinical Development Expert Group within the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries \nand Associations (EFPIA) established a Clinical Trial Design taskforce with the aim of exploring the \ncurrent and future landscape of innovation in clinical trial design, and to promote the awareness, \nunderstanding and acceptance of these designs amongst stakeholders.  Core to the mission of the \ntaskforce is promoting an ongoing evolution in drug development programs and clinical trials driven \nby the needs of patients that focus on value-added treatments.  \n\nThe EFPIA clinical trial design taskforce reviewed the emerging types of clinical trial designs of \ninterest for further research.  An initial range of clinical trial designs were prioritised as it was \nrecognised it would not be feasible to research all possible novel and emerging approaches to \nclinical trials.  However, it was considered feasible to focus on clinical trial designs identified by \nregulatory agencies as being of significant interest, such as the FDA and the Complex Innovative \nDesign pilot programme [1] and the EMA draft \u2018Regulatory Science to 2025\u2019 strategy [2], and where \nthere has been some experience of these designs in marketing authorisation applications or \nsubsequent post-authorisation applications.  A literature review was conducted, and relevant \ninformation has been included.    \n\nClinical trial innovation also extends to other areas intended to drive efficiency such as usage of \ncommon protocol, statistical analysis plan and study report templates and therapeutic area specific \ndata standards across industry as, for example, being developed by TransCelerate [3].  Innovation \nalso includes direct incorporation of patient data from electronic health records into study CRFs, and \npatient-centric measures, such as patient advisory boards, electronic informed consent, activity \nmonitors and other smartphone enabled technology solutions for measuring patient benefit and \nreplacing study site visits with home visits.  However, these important areas of clinical trial \ninnovation are beyond the scope of this white paper which focuses on the following categories of \ninnovative and novel clinical trial designs: \n\nv  Enrichment designs \nv  Adaptive designs \nv  Master protocols \nv  Use of historical controls in clinical trials  \n\n These categories of trials are interlinked.  This white paper is a landscape review of innovation in \nclinical trial design.  Some aspects are less well understood than others, as such additional papers \nmay follow allowing for a more in-depth discussion and review on specific topics as applicable.   \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\nEvery clinical trial features some form of enrichment, as is reflected in the inclusion and exclusion \ncriteria. Such criteria are intended to optimize assay sensitivity and benefit-risk, by defining how \npatients with the target disease/condition should be selected in terms of diagnosis and severity, \nwhich potentially confounding comorbidities, concomitant treatments and other patient \ncharacteristics that could affect efficacy assessments should be excluded and which co-morbidities \nand concomitant treatments should be excluded for reasons of patient safety. There are a multitude \nof disease specific clinical and regulatory guidelines which cover many of these aspects, especially \npatient identification.  \n\nThis approach generally reflects a relatively broad patient population e.g. patients with \nmild/moderate/severe disease/condition X/Y/Z etc. Studies designed in this (traditional) way may be \nsuccessful, but in the case of an unsuccessful outcome or when the treatment difference is much \nsmaller than anticipated, interrogation of the data may reveal some patients responded to study \ndrug and others did not. This raises a question of whether those responders are different in some \nway, whether they can be prospectively identified (e.g. with a specific phenotype or biomarker etc.) \nand -crucially- whether if a trial were restricted only to that specific subpopulation, the probability of \na successful outcome would be increased. This prospective identification of a subpopulation in which \nassay sensitivity is expected to be increased, is the type enrichment considered herein. As above, it \nmay be a strategy which is implemented after an unsuccessful trial or preferably it is done based \nupon a thorough understanding of the disease state and the pharmacology of a drug to drive \nsuccessful outcomes from initial studies in man through to approval. \n\nClinical trials using adaptive designs have been used for more than a decade and they were \nintroduced with the aim of increasing the probability of a trial achieving a successful outcome.  \nThese trials can improve how doses are selected in early phase studies, allow ineffective doses to be \ndropped in later phase studies and can reduce the time between phases of drug development with \nseamless designs for example phase 2/3 designs.  More recently, complex adaptive designs have \nemerged where the probability of which treatment group to assign the next patient depends on the \nresponses of previous patients enrolled in the trial using adaptive randomisation schemes.   \n\nWhilst adaptive designs have been available for many years, their use was limited.  Key factors that \nhave reduced the uptake of more complex designs include a lack of understanding of adaptive \ndesign strategies and methodologies, lack of validated software, concerns by industry on the \nacceptability by regulators and HTA agencies of the evidence generated, logistical burden of \nconducting more complex designs, and limited expertise to design and implement these types of \ntrials.  However, due to the creation of expert groups such as the Drug Information Association (DIA) \nAdaptive Design Working Group, the increased availability and use of software solutions such as \nFACTS, emerging FDA regulatory guidance on Adaptive Designs for Clinical Trials of Drugs and \nBiologics [4], and increase in the number of publications of case studies sharing experiences of \nalternative trial designs, adaptive designs are now more common place.  Despite this, the \nwidespread use of adaptive designs, especially the more complex designs where randomisation \nschema and treatments to be tested during a trial are modified after a trial starts, is still to be \nrealised.  \n\nAnother type of clinical trial gaining significant momentum in a range of disease settings, especially \noncology, are master protocols.  Umbrella, basket and platform trials fall into this category.  The \npaper by Woodcock et al [5] has provided much needed alignment and recommendations for \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n\fEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\nterminology, allowing clear definitions and descriptions of these designs and recently a draft \nguidance on \u201cMaster Protocols: Efficient Clinical Trial Design Strategies to Expedite Development of \nOncology Drugs and Biologics\u201d [6] has been published by the FDA.  Master protocols provide a novel \napproach for studying a number of new treatments in the same disease (umbrella), for studying a \nnew treatment in a number of related diseases (basket), or for studying multiple therapies in a single \ndisease in a perpetual and open-ended manner (platform).  These designs are complex for a variety \nof reasons:  the set of treatments to be studied in a trial can change during the trial, the patient \npopulations to be included in a trial can change over time, and the data to be collected could evolve \nafter a trial has started.  Compared to a traditional clinical trial design where these aspects are fixed \nat the start of a trial, platform trials are complex in terms of their design, how trials are \noperationalised and how trials are analysed. \n\nIn addition to more complex clinical trial designs, there has been an explosion in recent years on the \navailability of data, in particular, access to existing data sources, Big Data and real-world data.  In \nclinical settings where patient recruitment can be difficult, for example in rare disease populations \nwith limited number of patients, or in more common disease areas where patient recruitment is \nincreasingly difficult due to logistical and patient burden issues, using historical control data to \naugment or replace a control arm in a randomised control trial is of great interest.  The advantages \nof this approach are the ability to run a clinical trial (that may previously have been considered \nimpractical) effectively and efficiently thereby reducing patient burden as well as time and resources \nneeded for the study.  However, there are many challenges, including; when is it appropriate to \nconsider using historical control data; whether the historical control data available contain the \nspecific information of interest; which historical control is most appropriate; what are the potential \nbiases and limitations of the historical controls in terms of their clinical characteristics and treatment \nstrategies that were previously available relative to how current patients are being treated: and \nwhich patients are eligible for a treatment.  The use of a historical control, whether to partially or \ncompletely replace a concurrent control group or to augment a control group, will require more \ncomplex statistical methods in both the design and analysis of the clinical trial.   \n\nThe EFPIA CREG taskforce conducted a series of literature reviews in each of the above listed \ncategories of trial designs.  In sections 2-5, the findings from each literature review are summarised \nincluding describing the variety of trial designs under each category, highlighting useful reference \nmaterials for further reading, identifying published case studies, available regulatory guidance \ndocuments, and providing a series of recommendations.  The current knowledge, understanding and \nexperience of each of these types of designs varies and this is reflected in the white paper.  A great \ndeal of attention is focussed on adaptive designs, in particular understanding what has been learnt \nfrom the application of these designs over the last decade.  Challenges of each design are discussed, \nand potential risks and limitations are highlighted.   Future considerations highlight key areas of \nfocus to further advance innovation in clinical trial design.  The conclusion summarises key points \nand recommends all stakeholders embrace novel and complex designs where possible in their drug \ndevelopment programs.   \n\n2. Enrichment Strategies \n\n2.1 Definitions \nAn enrichment design is defined as \u201cThe prospective use of any patient characteristic to select a \nstudy population in which detection of a drug effect (if one in fact is present) is more likely than it \nwould be in an unselected population\u201d [7].    \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n\fEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\nIn the wider sense, all clinical trials are enriched in some way through selection criteria. The purpose \nof selection can be to decrease heterogeneity, to enrich from the prognostic standpoint (for example \npatients most likely to relapse or to have specific events of interest such as major adverse \ncardiovascular events), or to use predictive enrichment strategies (recruit only those patients most \nlikely to respond to a drug).  \n\n2.2 Pre-randomization run in periods \nWhen studies are conducted in conditions in which subjective endpoints are necessary (e.g. pain, \ndepression, anxiety, human abuse liability studies etc.) the pre-randomization period may be utilized \nto try to avoid recruiting patients with baseline score inflation/deflation, excessive placebo response \nor identify those refractory to or unable to discriminate treatment benefits. For example, blinded \nplacebo run-in may be incorporated as part of a trial in order to randomize only patients who remain \nsymptomatic under placebo i.e. to exclude patients who respond to placebo (by a pre-defined \ncriterion) who may compromise the opportunity to see a true drug effect if they were randomized. \nAn alternative is the blinded active withdrawal run-in, where only patients whose symptoms get \nworse on washout of active drug are randomized (i.e. a flare up of symptoms on withdrawal). A third \nstrategy is active run-in which can be used to identify patients who can accurately discriminate \nactive drug effects from placebo, and who can tolerate the active drug.  \n\n2.4 Predictive enrichment \nThis is the most promising category in terms of potential for innovative/adaptive design and \nprecision medicine. Identifying patients more likely to respond to an intervention is not a new \nconcept (traditional example: use of antibacterial drug in patients whose organism is sensitive to the \nantibacterial drug). This strategy is addressing an obvious need for more efficient trials and better \nbenefit-risk for subjects.  \n\nFor example, this strategy has been successfully implemented in the pain therapeutic area, where it \nhas been recognized for many years that only a proportion of patients actually responds to drugs. \nBecause of precedence and a regulatory preference, analgesic clinical trials have traditionally been \nconducted in specific patient populations which are based upon well-established clinical diagnoses \n(e.g. diabetic peripheral neuropathy, post herpetic neuralgia, complex regional pain syndrome etc.). \nHowever, it was elegantly established by the German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain in a \nlarge patient group that within single clinical diagnoses there is a considerable degree of \nheterogeneity based upon a number of quantitative sensory testing biomarkers [8]. This was \npostulated as an explanation for the observation that only a proportion of patients responds to \ntreatment with a given analgesic. Across different pain diagnoses, a number of specific \nsomatosensory profiles (determined by biomarkers) are conserved and this observation led to the \nidea that targeting a drug to a patient\u2019s specific pain phenotype (i.e. irrespective of clinical diagnosis) \nwould lead to a greater treatment effect. This was subsequently demonstrated in a biomarker \nstratified clinical trial design [9] who showed that oxcarbazepine is more efficacious for relief of \nperipheral neuropathic pain in patients with the \u201cirritable\u201d vs the \u201cnon-irritable\u201d nociceptor \nphenotype. \n\nEnrichment strategies based on pathophysiological biomarkers are not restricted to academic \nresearch. Several have been successfully implemented in reaching the end goal of a drug approval as \nis apparent from the Summaries of Product Characteristics which can be reviewed at \nwww.medicines.org.uk e.g. Trastuzumab in patients with overexpressed HER-2-neu receptor [10], \nImatinib in c-kit positive GIST tumours [11], and Vemurafenib in melanoma with the BRAF mutation. \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n\fEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\n[12].  However, with the development of more complex, \u201cpersonalized\u201d biomarkers, with less \nobvious mechanistic link to the drug effect, innovative approaches are called for.  \n\n2.5 Genomic biomarkers in oncology \nIn oncology, genomic material is frequently collected and analysed retrospectively for predictive \nvalue. In general, signals need to be confirmed in prospective trials, and this is where several \napproaches; adaptive or not, have been discussed [13, 14,15]. Key considerations include reducing \ntime, and numbers of patients and control of type I error, by splitting the trials in 2 phases, \nretrospective and prospective.  \n\nThe 2019 FDA guidance document on enrichment strategies provides general recommendations on \nstudy designs as well as numerous references, applying to different situations, including adaptive \nrandomization designs, with strategies to control type 1 error rates.  The numerous references \nprovided in the guidance document, as well as references from a literature search, provide technical \nand statistical methods to address those issues. \n\nThere are however few examples of those strategies having been used successfully for approval and \nthe feasibility of this approach may be country-specific \u2013 certain countries require specific lists of \ngenetic markers for informed consent forms at the beginning of the trial which may not be \ncompatible with exploratory analyses during the conduct of an adaptive trial unless every \nconceivable molecular marker has been pre-specified.  \n\n2.6 Design issues \nSeveral papers have described a theoretical framework for prospective predictive biomarker clinical \nvalidations.  Figure 1 summarises three types of design: biomarker stratified design (A), enrichment \ndesign (B), and biomarker-strategy design (C). Depending on the clinical setting and prior knowledge \nthe recommendations for their respective use are summarized in Table 1 [16].  The FDA guidance \nincludes recommendations consistent with the above.   In practice, those designs have been adopted \nfor academic trials but have rarely been used in confirmatory trials for drug registration.  \n\n2.7 Biomarker qualification and companion diagnostic co-development  \nPrognostic and predictive enrichment are heavily dependent on the performance characteristics of \nthe screening test and on whether or not the test can be utilized in the real world post-approval \nsetting. If the test is not routinely already available in clinical usage, consideration to developing a \ncompanion diagnostic is necessary. The definition of a companion diagnostic is a test that provides \ninformation that is essential for safe and effective use or a corresponding drug or biological product.  \n\nIn the context of drug development, FDA issued draft guidance on \u201cPrinciples for Co-development of \nan In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Device with a Therapeutic Product\u201d [17], \u201cBiomarker Qualification: \nEvidentiary Framework Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff DRAFT GUIDANCE\u201d [18] and \u201cDeveloping \nand Labeling In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices for a Specific Group or Class of Oncology \nTherapeutic Product\u201d (draft guidance, Dec 2018) [19].  While the EMA \u201cConcept paper on the \ndevelopment and lifecycle of personalised medicines and companion diagnostics that measure \npredictive biomarkers which help to assess the most likely response to a particular treatment\u201d [20] \nhas not been followed by a complete guideline yet. While a process has been developed by FDA for \ncollaboration between agencies for in vitro diagnostics and drug regulators, this has not been the \ncase so far in Europe although EMA has published \u201cletters of support\u201d and guidance for obtaining \nscientific advice on biomarker qualification. A proposed process was described at a stakeholder \nmeeting held in April 2017, and the general recommendation is to apply for CHMP qualification \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n\fEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\nopinion \u201con the acceptability of a specific use of the proposed method (e.g. use of a biomarker) in a \nresearch and development (R&D) context (non-clinical or clinical studies), based on the assessment \nof submitted data\u201d. The letters of support issued so far from that process are involving disease \nrelated markers, potential prognostic markers (for Alzheimer, COPD, toxicity markers), but no \ncompanion diagnostic.  \n\nThe new in vitro medical device directive [Error! Reference source not found.] is specifically \naddressing the companion diagnostic devices, which are to be treated as high risk device and require \nconsultation with drug authorities. A process is being developed for approval of such devices, similar \nto what is needed for drug device combinations. It is not very clear how clinical trial applications for \ndrug trials including a companion diagnostic device should be handled in the context of the new \nclinical trial regulation.  \n\nTo facilitate parallel submissions of applications for drug biomarker qualification or clinical outcome \nassessment to EMA and to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the two agencies \nlaunched a joint letter of intent in December 2014 [Error! Reference source not found.].  The list of \napproved companion diagnostic devices is available of FDA website [23].  \n\nIn conclusion, using enrichment designs for drug approval and/or companion diagnostics approvals is \nvery attractive but challenging and success will depend on how much prior knowledge and biological \nrationale are available before starting pivotal trials.  Key uncertainties include whether the proposed \nenrichment will in fact yield positive outcomes (e.g. have we enriched for the right thing) and \nscreening test performance (e.g. can the test be implemented in routine clinical practice), and \nregulatory/Health Technology Assessment (HTA) agencies\u2019 acceptance of the enrichment strategy. \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\nFigure 1 Types of Enrichment Designs \n\nSource: Freidlin et al. 2010 [14] \n\nFigure 1.

Adaptive Designs \n\nThe ideas for Adaptive Trial Designs date back to 1977 for Group Sequential (GS) designs for Phase III \ntwo arm trials, and 1990 for the Continuous Re-Assessment Method (CRM) for Phase I trials but use \nat that time was minimal. Adaptive Designs became, at least more discussed if not practiced in the \nlate 1990s.  ICH E9 \u2018Statistical Principles in Clinical Trials\u2019 [24] introduced the concept that trials could \nbe modified as defined in Independent Data Monitoring Committees.  There was a huge literature \npromoting and extending the CRM, the first major Bayesian response adaptive randomisation trial \n(the ASTIN trial) was run and the first papers on more flexible frequentist approaches to adaptive \ndesigns were published. Adaptive Designs became of widespread interest in the early 2000s with the \nestablishment of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) Adaptive \nDesigns Working Group in the US, as an element of the 2004 FDA Critical Path Initiative [25], and as \nthe subject of numerous conferences. The EMA published a reflections paper in 2007 [26] and FDA \npublished a draft guidance on adaptive designs in 2010 [27]. \n\nThis is the appropriate time to conduct this review given that it is over 10 years since the publication \nof the EU reflection paper, and in the US, a new draft guidance on adaptive trial designs was \npublished in September 2018 [4]. Furthermore, both Japan and Canada have Task Forces addressing \nthe topic and, in the case of Canada, there are commitments to fund further research in this area \n(Innovative Clinical Trials Initiative [28]). \n\n3.1 Definitions \n\nThe EMA reflection paper defines an \u2018adaptive\u2019 study design in a confirmatory setting as one in \nwhich statistical methodology allows the modification of a design element (e.g. sample size, \nrandomization ratio, treatment arms) at an interim analysis with full control of the type I error.  It \nadvises that such designs should only be used in trials with diseases, indications or populations \nwhere clinical trials will be difficult to perform e.g. where there are ethical constraints to \nexperimentation.  The reflection paper does not discuss specific statistical methods but addresses \nopportunities for interim trial design modifications and considerations when flexibility is introduced \ninto a confirmatory efficacy trial.  \n\nThe FDA in the US provide a broader scope in their latest draft guidance.  Like the EMA, the FDA \ndefines an \u2018adaptive design\u2019 as a clinical trial design that allows for prospectively planned \nmodifications to one or more aspects of the design based on accumulating data from subjects in the \ntrial. However, in contrast to the EU reflection paper, while the need for control of type I error in \nsimulation and not analysis is explicitly highlighted.   This draft guidance addresses special \nconsiderations for adaptive trials as well as issues to consider in the evaluation of a completed study.   \n\nThere appears to be an increase in the use of adaptive trial design in recent years [9, 13].  Most \nexamples of the use of adaptive designs occur in the earlier stages of clinical development \n(predominantly phase II) with significantly fewer examples in confirmatory trials; of the various \ndisease areas they have predominantly, but not exclusively, been used in oncology.  Table A1 in the \nappendix provides a number of examples of products that span a broad range of conditions, from \nHIV to psoriass,which have been approved by US and EU regulators and include some element of \nadaptive design in their clinical development. \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n16 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n\fEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\n3.2 Types of Adaptation \n\nThere are several different types of adaption that may be used in clinical development, many of \nwhich were highlighted in the literature search. These are summarised in Table 2. There are also \nelements that, whilst not in themselves types of adaptation, are often associated with adaptive \ndesigns. These are summarised in Table 3. Both tables include a consideration of their respective \nbenefits and drawbacks. \n\n3.3 Debates in the literature about the use of adaptive trial designs \n\nThere have been two principle concerns expressed with adaptive designs, one is the issue of their \nethics, the second is the statistical efficiency of the use of response adaptive randomization \nincluding trial and data integrity and operational difficulties. \n\nEthical Considerations \n\nThe principle ethical point debated is that for patients with serious diseases enrolled in clinical trials, \nthe randomized allocation of their treatment by chance is only supportable where there is genuine \nuncertainty about the relative efficacy of the treatments being compared in the trial. Outcome-\nadaptive allocation schemes, or response adaptive randomization are cited by some as unethical \ngiven that they dynamically adjust the allocation ratio in favour of the better performing treatment \narm. This seems a little peculiar as the typical adaptive allocation strategy is to reflect the probability \nthat the treatment is better in the randomization. The 2018 draft FDA guidance on adaptive designs \nregards ethical considerations as a possible advantage of adaptive designs. \u201cThere are many ways in \nwhich an adaptive design can provide ethical advantages over a non-adaptive design. For example, \nthe ability to stop a trial early if it becomes clear that the trial is unlikely to demonstrate \neffectiveness can reduce the number of patients exposed to the unnecessary risk of an ineffective \ninvestigational treatment and allow subjects the opportunity to explore more promising therapeutic \nalternatives.\u201d \n\nStatistical Considerations \n\nArguments over response adaptive randomization have to be divided into two very distinct settings. \nThe first is the two-arm setting of comparing a treatment against a control, and the second is when \ncomparing multiple treatment arms against a control.  \n\nIn the first case, of adaptive randomization between just two arms, it has been shown that \nstatistically biasing the randomization by response inevitably loses some statistical power.  The \ncounter (non-statistical) argument becomes whether it is ethical to randomize in equipoise when our \nbelief is no longer in equipoise, and whether in certain indications it will be possible to recruit \nsubjects into a trial where they only have a 50% probability of being randomized to the new \ntreatment. Lastly when balancing the treatment of subjects in the trial against the treatment of \nfuture patients, the greater the proportion of the potential treatment population that will be \nrecruited in to the trial the greater the relative benefit of optimizing the treatment of subjects in the \ntrial compared to completing the trial as efficiently as possible. \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n17 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n \n\fEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\nAdaptation \n\nDescription \n\nBenefits \n\nChallenges \n\nTable 2: Types of Adaptation \n\nStopping Early \nfor Futility \n\nThe use of a statistical measure \nsuch as a test statistic, conditional \npower, a Bayesian posterior \nprobability or a Bayesian predictive \nprobability, to make the decision to \nstop a trial for futility at an interim \nanalysis point. \n\nThis adaptation is one part of a \nconventional Group Sequential trial \n(the other part is stopping for \nefficacy \u2013 see below) It is also \nfrequently used along with other \nadaptations. \n\nStopping for early futility (when the results are clear that \nthe trial is futile) allows patients and resources to be more \nquickly allocated to new trials. It is also only ethical to stop \na trial if the early data is so overwhelmingly negative that \nthere is almost no chance of the trial being ultimately \nsuccessful. \n\nEarly stopping for futility has the advantage of not being \nstatistically contentious, since it does not inflate type-1 \nerror and there is no need to adjust the significance \nthreshold in the final analysis. \n\nThe designers must decide how many interims to \ninclude in the trial, at what points in the trial and what \nthe futility stopping bounds should be. \n\nStopping early for futility does introduce a risk of \nstopping for futility when there is in truth an effect and \nhence a drop in the \u201cpower\u201d of the trial. This can be \nmitigated by setting the stopping boundaries \nconservatively, but it is up to the trial designers to \nmake the trade-off between the loss of power and the \nability to detect futility early. \n\nEarly stopping for futility does reduce the type-1 error and \nwhen used in combination with early stopping for efficacy \nit allows the significance threshold for early efficacy \nstopping to be lowered slightly. However, latest FDA \nGuidance on Adaptive Trials: \u201cif a trial continues despite \nmeeting prespecified futility rules, the Agency will likely \nconsider the trial to have failed \u2026\u201d  \n\nFinally, if the drop-in power is not too great it can be \nrecovered by a corresponding increase in the overall \ntrial sample size, which can be done whilst still having \na smaller expected average sample size compared to \nthe fixed design. This will however have potential time \nand cost implications that will need to be weighed, \nagain using simulations to estimate the trade-off. \n\n18 \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\nAdaptation \n\nDescription \n\nBenefits \n\nChallenges \n\nTable 2: Types of Adaptation (continued) \n\nEarly stopping \nfor efficacy \n\nEarly stopping for efficacy is the second most \ncommon form of adaptation, normally used in \ncombination with early stopping for futility in a \ngroup sequential design. \n\nEarly stopping for success does introduce the \nneed for a statistical correction \u2013 the \nadditional opportunities to stop for success \ncreate additional opportunities to make a \ntype-1 error and the significance level of the \nstatistical test needs to be adjusted to counter \nact this. This is the purpose of the \u201cgroup \nsequential\u2019 design process, and it achieves \nthis as efficiently as possible. However, note \nthat the majority of the group sequential \ndesign literature only concerns itself with \ncomparing a single treatment arm against a \ncontrol arm. For trials testing multiple \ntreatment arms the more limited literature and \nrecent literature on MAMS (Multi-Arm Multi-\nStage) designs should be consulted. \n\nThe design can take into account the amount \nof information required to make other \ndeterminations after the trial, over and above \nthe detection of a treatment effect, and insure \nthat the earliest check for stopping for success \nis not until these requirements have been met. \n\nAs long as the design ensures that the first \ninterim is not until this minimum required \ninformation has been collected, then it is clear \nthat there is both an ethical and commercial \nadvantage to stopping early for efficacy \u2013 an \neffective treatment will become available to \npatients earlier. \n\nIssues to be decided around early stopping designs \ninclude: when to start checking for stopping; how often \nto check; and how aggressive to be. Typically, one \nthinks of apportioning the possible \u201ctype-1 error\u201d \nbetween the various interims and the final analysis. A \nmore aggressive design allows greater chance of error \nat early interims \u2013 increasing the chance of early \nstopping, at the price of greater adjustment of the \nsignificance level at the final analysis to reduce the \nprobability of errors at that point.  \n\nA problem with conventional early stopping rules is that \nthey only consider the information available at the \ninterim \u2013 and in many cases there will have been \nsubjects recruited into the trial but not yet complete. The \nissue then arises regarding how to manage any less \nfavourable subsequent analysis after all subjects \ncomplete, a problem known as overrun. \n\nEarly work on Group Sequential trials tended to ignore \nthis time to final endpoint issue reporting sample size \nsavings as though the endpoint was instantaneous. \nBayesian versions of Group Sequential allow \nlongitudinal models to be used to incorporate the data \non the incomplete patients and predictive probabilities to \nbe used to make stopping decisions based on the final \nexpected outcomes. \n\n19 \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\nAdaptation \n\nDescription \n\nBenefits \n\nChallenges \n\nTable 2: Types of Adaptation (continued) \n\nSample Size \nRe-assessment \n\nA Sample Size re-assessment \ncan either be \u201cblinded\u201d or \u201cun-\nblinded\u201d. At an interim the \ncurrent study data is analyzed \nand the further sample size \nrequired to complete the study is \ncomputed \u2013 usually with both \nminimum and a maximum \namount by which it will be \nincreased. The aim of the \nincrease is to protect the \nplanned power of the trial. \n\nBlinded re-assessments are used to adjust the \nsample size incase \"nuisance\" factors such as \nthe variability of the endpoint are worse than \nexpected, they provide an insurance against \nsome of the possible incorrect assumptions \nthat have to be made when designing a trial. \nBlinded sample size re-assessments can be \ndone so they do not inflate type-1 error and so \nno adjustment to the required significance is \nrequired and they are looked on favourably by \nregulators. \n\nUnblinded re-assessments are used to adjust \nthe sample size in-case the observed \ntreatment effect at the interim is worse than \nhoped for, but still sufficient to be useful. It can \nbe used as an investment decision point. \n\nIn designing a sample size re-assessment, like other adaptations, \none has to balance early adaptation (allowing greater saving) against \nadaptation too early that is misled into making a wring adaptation by \nrandom variation in a small data set. The risk is of not expanding the \nsample size when that is actually required to maintain power, or of \nexpanding it unnecessarily.

If the \nresponse on a particular treatment arm \nis sufficiently poor at an interim then \nthat treatment arm is dropped from the \ntrial, but the trial continues. \n\nAs the setting is a multi-arm trial, if the \nobjective is to select the best \nefficacious dose (not test each \ntreatment arm independently for \nsuccess/futility) then the dropping rules \ncan be based on \u201cthe probability that \nthe arm has the maximum response\u201d \u2013 \nso that arms that have some observed \ntreatment effect, but are clearly not the \nbest, can be dropped. \n\nThe advantage of arm dropping during a trial is that it allows either the \ntrial to complete sooner (the overall sample size is shrunk by the future \nsubjects that are not now recruited for that arm) or more data to be \ncollected on the remaining arms (by re-allocating those future subjects \nbetween them).  \n\nLike response adaptive randomization \n(see below) it is important not to allow \nthe adaptation until there has been a \nreasonable initial amount of data (the \n\u201cburn-in\u201d) collected. \n\nArm dropping can make a trial more ethical, by reducing the allocation \nof subjects to ineffective treatments and possibly increasing the \nallocation to effective treatments. \n\nCompared to response adaptive randomization (see below), arm \ndropping is considered to be easier to implement in terms of managing \nthe randomization and the supply. \n\nThere is a frequentist form of arm dropping design, that is an extension \nof group sequential designs called \u201cMAMS\u201d designs (Multi-Arm Multi-\nStage) which can provide analytical control of type-1 error \u2013 but these \ntend to be limited to dropping arms simply on the basis of that arms \nresponse rate relative to control, not its response rate relative to the \nbest arm. \n\nHowever due to the irreversible nature \nof the decision, arm dropping normally \nneeds to be more conservative than \nresponse adaptive randomization \nwhere there is an opportunity to correct \nfrom giving an arm a very low \nallocation at one interim at a \nsubsequent one if the balance of the \ndata changes. \n\n21 \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\nAdaptation \n\nDescription \n\nBenefits \n\nChallenges \n\nTable 2: Types of Adaptation (continued) \n\nResponse \nAdaptive \nRandomisation \n(RAR) \n\nIn a RAR design, after \nan initial period, over a \nseries of interims the \nrandomization ratios are \nadjusted to give \npreference to arms that \nhave a higher probability \nof meeting some criteria, \ntypically predicted to \nhave a greater \nprobability of success \n(but it can be more \ncomplex than that when \ntaking a number of \ndifferent endpoints into \nconsideration) \n\nTrials with multiple arms response \nadaptive randomization (RAR) can \nassign more patients to the arm most \nlikely to be selected at the end of the \ntrial. This increases the power of the \ncomparison of that arm with the control \narm, and provides more data on the \nselected arm than a fixed allocation \nwould. \n\nResponse Adaptive Randomisation can \nmake a trial more ethical, by reducing \nthe allocation of subjects to ineffective \ntreatments and possibly increasing the \nallocation to effective treatments. \n\nThere are many options in an RAR trial design \u2013 when to start adapting, what to \n\u2018target\u2019 in the adaptation, how frequently to adapt and what proportion to allocate to \nthe control arm. These need to be explored and optimized using simulations. \n\nIn trials with only two-arms (a novel treatment and control) the use of RAR is \ncontentious, and generally it is agreed that the loss of power in this setting means it \nshould not be used.  There are some circumstances when RAR could be beneficial \nin a two-arm setting \u2013 better treatment of the subjects in the trial, for instance when \nthe study population is effectively the whole patient population. \n\nIn the multi-arm setting, \u201cresponse adaptive techniques can in some circumstances \nminimize the variance of test statistics, leading to shorter trials, smaller samples \nsizes and/or greater statistical power\u201d [FDA 2018 draft guidance]. When data is \navailable early enough to be able to adapt on, simulations show that a response \nadaptive design on average preforms better than a fixed or arm dropping design \n[paper in review] as long as adaptations do not start too soon, nor reduce the \nallocation to the control arm. Simulations of the design will be necessary to ensure \nthat adaptations aren\u2019t started until there is sufficient data to adapt to. \n\n22 \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fAdaptation \n\nSeamless \ndesigns \n\nEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\nDescription \n\nBenefits \n\nChallenges \n\nTable 2: Types of Adaptation (continued) \n\nA \u201cseamless\u201d trial design is one that combines \ntwo phases of drug development in one trial. \nThus, possible trials a are Seamless Phase 1/2, \nPhase 2a/2b and Phase 2/3. The design of the \nphases can themselves be fixed or adaptive, in \na seamless design, the decision\u2019s usually taken \nbetween the two phases are instead taken in a \npre-specified fashion and with control of \nblinding. \n\nThere are two principal \nbenefits of a seamless \ndesign: \n\n\u2022  Saving in time, the usual \n6-12 month gap between \nphases is avoided. \n\n\u2022 \n\nInclusion of data from the \nfirst stage in the analysis \nin the second stage.

The concern was that there were \nmany potential learnings from a Phase 2 trial over and above a go/no-go \ndecision, dose selection and effect size estimation. These are still valid \nconcerns and it is likely that seamless phase 2/3 trials will predominantly be \nin well understood diseases with well understood endpoints, such as \nDiabetes, and the risk of \u201cunknown unknowns\u201d is felt to be small, or in rare \ndiseases where it will be difficult to recruit of a standard size phase 3 trial in \na reasonable time. \n\nA seamless design will typically take longer to design and require larger \nupfront investment (particularly in manufacturing capacity) and this needs to \nbe taken into account in deciding to embark on a seamless design. \n\nIf the final endpoint is not relatively soon after enrolment, then there a \nnumber of challenges: \n\n\u2022  What to do with subject\u2019s accrued but not complete at the time of the \n\nbetween stage interim. \n\n\u2022  What to do with enrolment while transitioning from the first stage to the \nsecond stage, if it is paused or slowed, how easy will it be to re-start it? \n\nThere may be significant operation steps between the stages \n(manufacturing, open more sites etc.), if the design aims to be inferentially \nseamless considerable care will need to be taken to maintain the blinding. \n\n23 \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n\fEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\nFeature \n\nDescription \n\nBenefits \n\nChallenges \n\nTable 3 Developments that are not specific to adaptive designs but are particularly relevant to them \n\nClinical Trial \nSimulation \n\nWriting computer code \nthat simulates the \nrandom sampling of \nsubject responses from a \nnumber of assumed \n\u2018true\u2019 distributions \n(\u201cscenarios\u201d) and \napplying the planned trial \ndesign to it to see how \nthe design performs.  \n\nSimulations have a number of significant advantages over the \ndesign by sample size calculation/analytical method: \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nrather than using single fixed assumptions for the \nunknown elements the simulations can incorporate all the \nsignificant unknowns (e.g. accrual rate, dropouts, time to \ndata), \n\nthe simulations can simulate data coming from more \ncomplex distributions (e.g. joint distributions, truncated \ndistributions, hazard rates that vary over time) than \nsample size calculations allow for, \n\nthe trial designs can include features which would \npreclude a sample size calculation, \n\nthe simulation results allow the estimation of additional \nfeatures of the trial that may be important (or even critical) \nto correct decision making after the trial \u2013 such as the \nlikelihood of selecting the correct dose or selecting the \ncorrect patient sub-groups. \n\nThe drawback is the time and resources required to write and \ntest the required computer code. In particular as it is usual to \nhave to modify the design and the code (due to changing \nexternal circumstances and to what is learnt from the \nsimulations) and repeat the simulations several times.  \n\nTypically, simulations are run over a range of specific \nscenarios, each scenario being simulated 1,000-10,000 times \nin order to provide a reasonable estimate of the design\u2019s \nperformance in that setting. The definition of each scenario will \nhave many aspects to it and it is highly unlikely that any one \nscenario exactly matches what eventually transpires in the \nreal trial. Thus, the aim should be for the scenarios to \u2018bracket\u2019 \nwhat is likely to occur in practice and rely on the fact that \noperating characteristics in almost all settings change \nsmoothly (and often monotonically) as each parameter in the \nscenario is changed. Thus, the performance in the actual trial \ncould be inferred from the scenarios that were close to it. \n\nSometimes simulation may use a distribution of scenarios \nsampled from estimates of the range of the likely values of the \ndifferent parameters that make up the scenarios (such as: \ndose response, safety/side effects, endpoint variability, rates \non the control arm, endpoint correlation, accrual rate, \ndropouts) but this is usually to estimate the likely outcome of \nthe trial rather than characterize the design. \n\n24 \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\nTable 3 Developments that are not specific to adaptive designs but are particularly relevant to them (continued) \n\nFeature \n\nDescription \n\nBenefits \n\nChallenges \n\nDose \nResponse \nModelling \n\nSimultaneous evaluation of \nmultiple doses of a \ntreatment within a unified \nstatistical model,  \n\nResponse modelling across doses increases the power of the \ntrial to detect an effect in circumstances where normally power \nhas been lost due to adjusting for multiplicity of testing multiple \ndoses. \n\nDose response modelling also allows the treatment effect to be \ninferred for intermediate doses that have not been tested. \n\nThe problem is that the response modelling may make \nassumptions about the shape of the dose response that may \nnot be borne out by the data collected. But approaches such \nas model averaging (MCP-Mod) or Bayesian smoothing \nmodels (such as NDLM) can be used to avoid assumptions \nabout the shape of the data. \n\nDose Response modelling is not used in Phase 3 trials, as \ntesting enough doses to make dose response modelling \nworthwhile normally has to be completed before Phase 3 \nstarts. \n\nBayesian \nStatistics \n\nAs an alternative to \nconventional frequentist \nstatistics that calculate a p-\nvalue, Bayesian statistics \ncan be used, either just for \ninterim decision making or \nalso for the final analysis. \n\nUsing Bayesian statics to analyze the trial data allows more \ncomplex models to be deployed, prior data to be incorporated, \nand more natural statistical conclusions to be drawn. The \nAmerican Statistical Association published a statement on p-\nvalues [ref] urging that their role be reduced and their \nunsuitability for inference. \n\nBayesian statistics allow data to be borrowed in a flexible \nfashion using hierarchical models, predictive probabilities to be \ncalculated and evidence for or against conclusions to be \nweighed. \n\nThe principle challenges of the use of Bayesian statistics are \nfirstly the need to specify \u201cprior\u201d beliefs about the parameters \nand secondly that the type-1 error of a planned analysis under \na Null hypothesis is no longer analytically controlled but needs \nto be shown by simulation.  \n\nThe setting up of the \u201cpriors\u201d is important as these priors can \nhave an impact on the calculated final values (the \u201cposterior\u201d \nestimates) it is important that these priors reflect the beliefs of \nthose who need to be convinced, not those aiming to do the \nconvincing. But these may be diverse and difficult to elicit.  \n\nFor instance Designs using Bayesian stopping rules allow rules \nthat can be stated more naturally (\u201cif this trial were to run to its \ncompletion what is the probability the final analysis would be \nsuccessful?\u201d and \u201cif we were to stop accrual now and follow-up \nthe current subjects to completion, what is the probability the \nfinal analysis would be successful?\u201d). \n\nIn order to set decision thresholds on the posterior estimates \nthat control type-1 error to the required degree, the trial design \nhas to be simulated over a range of \u201cnull hypotheses\u201d. While \nthe 2010 draft FDA guidance said that this process was \n\u201ccontroversial\u201d, the 2018 draft FDA guidance lays out a \nprocess for implementing it. \n\n25 \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\nTable 3 Developments that are not specific to adaptive designs but are particularly relevant to them (continued) \n\nFeature \n\nDescription \n\nBenefits \n\nChallenges \n\nEndpoint \nadaptation \n\nIf a trial has multiple primary \nendpoints (such as a more \ndesirable one versus one \nwhere it may be easier to \nshow a treatment effect) but \ntesting them carries a \nstatistical penalty for \n\u201cmultiplicity\u201d. \n\nIt might be possible to reduce \nthe statistical penalty by select \nbetween the endpoints at an \ninterim, fixing which will be \ntested first before gathering \nand testing the remaining data. \n\nUtility Function  A utility function can be used \n\nto combine the results on \ndifferent endpoint such as \nefficacy and safety or primary \nand secondary efficacy \nendpoints. \n\nThis can reduce the risk of mis pre-selecting the order in testing the \nendpoints, or reduce the cost of testing a number of endpoints in \nparallel.  \n\nThe adaptation of endpoint runs the risk of mis-\nselection if made on too little data, but the less \ndata collected after the selection the less the \nbenefit of the adaptation. Like other adaptations \nit will be necessary to sun simulations in order to \nevaluate the trad-offs. \n\nA utility function allows dose selection and adaptive decisions to be \nmade on the basis of benefit risk or total benefit. \n\nIt can be hard to get consensus on the endpoints \nto include and to the relative weights to be given \nto the various endpoints in the overall utility \nfunction. Whether they need to be accepted by \nthe regulator depends on the use made of the \nutility function \u2013 it can just be used for internal \ndecision making such as for dose selection \nrather than to support regulatory approval. \n\n26 \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\nTable 3 Developments that are not specific to adaptive designs but are particularly relevant to them (continued) \n\nFeature \n\nDescription \n\nBenefits \n\nChallenges \n\nDisease \nModelling \n\nImproved \nEndpoints \n\nThis method has been \nintroduced for degenerative \ndiseases, where the subject\u2019s \nstage of the disease affects \neither the likely degree of \nfurther degeneration that might \nbe seen over the observation \nperiod of the trial (e.g. \nAlzheimer\u2019s Disease) or the \nappropriate endpoint measure \nto use (e.g. Duchenne \nMuscular Dystrophy). \n\nStandard outcome measures \nmay not be equally informative \nfor all patients or may be crude \nand not reflect patient \npriorities. Improving endpoint \nmeasures can increase the \npower of a trial and /or \nincrease the evaluable patient \npopulation. \n\nThis approach ensures that all subject data are informative about the \ndegree of treatment effect. Without it, subjects may fail to contribute to \nthe estimate either because the change in endpoint is small relative to \nthat of other subjects (e.g. Alzheimer\u2019s Disease patients with only \nmoderate cognitive impairment will only show a slight decline in \ncognitive measures over two years compared to those more advanced \nin the disease), or the endpoint is inappropriate to the subject\u2019s current \ncondition (e.g. 6 minute walk for patients with wasting diseases such \nas Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Progressive Multiple Sclerosis and \nGNE Myopathy.   In such wasting conditions early in the disease \npatients may have no impairment in their walk over the period of the \ntrial while later in the disease patients may be unable to walk at all). \n\nFor progressive diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and Multiple \nSclerosis patients expected progression is highly dependent on a \npatient\u2019s state when entering the trial. An endpoint that uses a \nprogressive disease model (e.g. the EPAD trial in Alzheimer\u2019s disease) \nallows a trial to have greater power or broader inclusion criteria [29].  \n\nDichotomous or simple ranked outcomes can be replaced by scoring \nschemes that properly reflect the impact of the different outcomes on \nthe patient population (e.g. the DAWN trial) and provide greater \nstatistical power. \n\nThe use of disease modelling shares the \nproblems of potentially introducing a new \nendpoint. This will require regulatory \nendorsement supported by a clinical rationale. \nInput from patient groups could be valuable in \nthe selection of a new endpoint. This is \ncompounded by the additional complexity of a \ndisease model as an endpoint and concern over \nthe comparability in changes in the score at one \nof the scales compared to changes at the other.      \n\nThe introduction of new endpoints will require \nregulatory endorsement supported by a clinical \nrationale, and can be challenging. There is also \na risk that the results of new trials are not \ncomparable to those of previous trials. There will \nbe the concern that the new endpoint may be \nless stringent and may not correspond to \nmeaningful clinical improvement.  \n\n27 \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n \n\fEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\nIn the second case, comparing multiple arms against control, in the normal setting where the aim is \nto demonstrate efficacy and select a treatment then response adaptive randomization is more \nefficient than fixed randomization \u2013 as long as sufficient allocation to control is maintained.   \n\nGeneral Considerations \n\nAdditionally, the DIA conducted a recent survey to investigate potential barriers to implementing \nadaptive designs. Respondents to the survey highlighted some of the persistent barriers to \nimplementing adaptive designs as very practical issues including:  education of teams on \nmethodology; lack of validated software available; team preference; lack of time to conduct clinical \ntrial simulations; negative experience; and perceived regulatory risk.  \n\nRegarding patient Involvement in relation to adaptive designs, the European Patients\u2019 Academy \n(EUPATI) advises that patient input into adaptive design can help researches identify the most \nappropriate design by helping to define and understand the needs and requirements of the patient \npopulation. Patients can also be involved in the Data Monitoring Committee.  Its website [30] \nprovides educational material on adaptive designs. \n\n3.4 Regulatory authority recommendations when considering the use of adaptive \ndesigns in clinical trials \n\nIn 2014, EMA published a short paper summarizing their scientific advice experience of adaptive \ndesign (Adaptive clinical trial designs for European marketing authorization: a survey of scientific \nadvice letters from the EMA from 2014) [31].  Among the observations that were highlighted in the \npaper around potential adaptive designs included continuing concerns over the ability to control for \ntype 1 errors. The paper also included several other points for medicine developers to consider \nwhen planning to employ an adaptive study design including the need to provide sound justifications \nof the adaptive design proposed; inclusion of (extensive) simulation studies, where the operating \ncharacteristics of the adaptive design are compared to more classical approaches as fixed sample \ntrials or several trials in sequence; and concerns that the extent of reflection and adaptation \nrequired at the end of phase II will be too extensive to make a phase II/III \u2018seamless\u2019 trial practical.  \n\nFollowing a subsequent analysis of completed confirmatory studies published by EMA authors, they \nconclude more positively that \u201cif properly pre-planned, adaptations can play a key role in the success \nof some of these trials, for example to help successfully select the most promising dose regimens for \nphase II/III trials. Interim analyses can also enable stopping of trials for futility when they do not hold \ntheir promises\u2019. The authors go on to state that Type I error rate and bias control, trial integrity and \nresults consistency between the different stages of the analyses are fundamental aspects to be \ndiscussed thoroughly. They also recommend engaging in early dialogue with regulators and \nimplementing the scientific advice received [32]. \n\nThe 2018 FDA draft guidance on adaptive designs has a more positive approach than its predecessor.  \nIt notes that \u201cadaptive designs can provide a variety of advantages over non-adaptive designs. These \nadvantages arise from the fundamental property of clinical trials with an adaptive design: they allow \nthe trial to adjust to information that was not available when the trial began. The specific nature of \nthe advantages depends on the scientific context and type or types of adaptation considered.  \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n28 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n \n\fEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\nAdvantages cited by FDA are statistical efficiency, ethical considerations, generalisability and \nimproved understanding of drug effects as well as acceptability to stakeholders. \n\nThe perspectives of both regulatory authorities support the notion that over the last ten years their \npositions have moved from initial reservations to a more encouraging attitude towards the use of \nadaptive designs in clinical trials. \n\n4. Master Protocols \n\nThe use of biomarkers to identify small genetic sub-populations within a disease has resulted in \nincreasing limited numbers of patients being eligible for a specific treatment regimen. This has led to \nthe need for trial designs which encompass several treatment options depending on the genetic \nsubtype of patient entering the trial. Such master protocols are particularly useful in the field of \noncology [33], where using biomarkers to identify those patients likely to respond to a therapy is \nnow standard practice. However, master protocols can also be useful in other therapeutic areas \nwhere there are several treatment options to be tested or where a given disease can be \ndifferentiated in multiple sub-categories. Recent examples of the uptake of these designs outside \noncology include clinical trials for Alzheimer\u2019s Disease [34,35,36] and infective diseases [37,38].  In \nall cases the complexity of these trials can be challenging and there is a need for guidance and best \npractice sharing among industry and other stakeholders. \n\nIn addition to the FDA guidance on master protocols, the Clinical Trials Facilitation and Coordination \nGroup (CTFG) recently published a recommendation paper on the Initiation and conduct of complex \nclinical trials [39]. \n\nBy conducting a literature and database search, as well as gathering information shared at various \nmeetings with Health Authority, HTA, and other stakeholder representatives, the authors of this \npaper have complied a summary of current stakeholder perspectives on master protocols, which \nencompass umbrella, basket and platform trial designs. This chapter discusses the advantages and \ndisadvantages of these novel trial designs and provides suggestions on how better alignment can be \nreached amongst stakeholders on the use of these novel designs to support drug development, \napproval and rapid patient access to innovative medicines.  \n\n4.1 Definitions \n\nMaster protocols are defined in a recent review paper [5] as overarching protocols designed to \nanswer multiple questions. Included under this broad definition of a master protocol are three types \nof designs: umbrella, basket, and platform trials. \n\nMaster protocols can bring multiple benefits: \n\n\u2022  Allow to quickly test hypotheses and answer scientific questions \n\n\u2022  Evaluate and compare treatments and combinations thereof, maximizing trial opportunities \n\nfor patients \n\n\u2022  Access to complex disease areas and/or rare indications (small populations) \n\n\u2022  Collaborative set-up, allows for better efficiency  \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n29 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\n\u2022  Faster time to activation of additional study arms to investigate new sub-populations or \n\nstudy drugs \n\n\u2022  Faster clinical development and patient access to transformative drugs \n\nHowever, there are also potential drawbacks associated with the intrinsic complexity of master \nprotocols, which are set out below for the different study designs. \n\n4.2 Umbrella Trials \n\nUmbrella trial designs are useful e.g. when there are different genetic mutations of one disease or \nwhen several promising drugs and treatment options are being investigated for the same disease. \nUmbrella trials can have a single protocol encompassing multiple treatment arms or one overarching \nscreening protocol and several separate protocols for each individual treatment option. In oncology \numbrella trials the patients are screened on entry and assigned to one of several possible drug \ntreatment arms, usually based on results of biomarker tests (Figure 2). Umbrella trials often have \nadaptive elements which enable the opening and closing of study arms depending on the effect of \nthe test drugs on a specific molecular target. Such trials also enable new and more specific \nbiomarkers to be added during the course of the study to ensure all patients receive a therapy that is \noptimally targeted at their disease: However, this design also has limitations as shown in Table 4. \n\nFigure 2: Schematic Representation of a Master Protocol with Umbrella Trial Design \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n30 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\nTable 4: Benefits and Limitations of Umbrella Trials \n\nUMBRELLA TRIALS \n\nBENEFITS \n\u2022  A single control arm can be used with a \n\nstandard comparator treatment for the \ndisease being investigated \n\n\u2022  Clustering different biomarkers under a \nsingle trial will help to reduce the screen \nfailure rate, avoid multiple screening of \npatients, and increase the likelihood of a \npatient being eligible to participate in a \nstudy \n\nLIMITATIONS \n\u2022  There are statistical challenges for introducing new \ntreatment arms after a study has started regarding \npotential introduction of bias compared to treatments \nand control in place at the start of the trial \n\n\u2022  Treatment assignment/stratification is often based \non molecular biomarkers so centralized screening \ntests are required for multiple biomarkers, as locally \nperformed genotyping can lead to less reproducible \nresults \n\n\u2022  Enables a direct comparison of several \n\n\u2022  Each new diagnostic biomarker needs to be \n\ntreatment options for a disease \n\u2022  Due to the multi-pronged approach, \n\numbrella trials can accelerate the speed \nof development, save costs and support \nrapid approval of new drugs (however, \nregulatory acceptance varies in the \ndifferent regions). \n\n\u2022  Operational efficiencies due to familiar \ntrial procedures for the different arms. \n\nvalidated and will be subject to a regulatory approval \npathway \n\n\u2022  Standard of care for a disease may change during \nthe course of lengthy trials as new treatments \nbecome available, potentially requiring changes to \nthe control arm treatment, which could have \nimplications for statistical inferences (see also \nsection on use of historical controls and changes in \nstandard of care) \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n31 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n\fEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\n4.3 Basket Trials \n\nIn basket trials the effect of a drug is tested on patients who are selected using a single type of \nbiological marker or have an overarching condition (e.g. pain) which occurs in a variety of diseases or \norgans (Figure 3).

High \ntreatment efficacy is a prerequisite to correctly \ndetermine the trial arms which should be \ncontinued or discontinued and avoid a selection \nbias based on chance findings in a few patients \n\n\u2022  Many patients must be tested to find the few \nwho fit the disease profile targeted by the \ntreatment. It is frustrating for patients who agree \nto be screened when they are told they are not \neligible to be treated because their disease \nprofile does not match the drug target. \n\u2022  Complexity of basket trials can lead to very \n\nlengthy protocols (> 500 pages) which present \nproblems for ECs and investigators \n\n\u2022  Basket trials require several individual patient \ninformation leaflets and different informed \nconsent forms for the various indications \n\n\u2022  Suitable principle investigators and facilities are \nrequired at each trial site to cover each of the \nindications in a basket trial, which is often \ndifficult to realize \n\n4.4 Platform trials \n\nIn platform trials, patients\u2019 samples are tested for various predefined biomarkers according to a \n\u201cscreening protocol\u201d and then based on these results they are assigned to a treatment arm within \nthe Master Protocol [40,41] (Figure 4). The master protocol prospectively defines the criteria for \nadding and closing the different treatment arms as the trial progresses, as well as for switching \npatients between arms.  An example of such a trial is the NCI-MATCH trial [42] which is mentioned in \nthe FDA draft guidance on \u201cMaster Protocols: Efficient Clinical Trial Design Strategies to Expedite \nDevelopment of Oncology Drugs and Biologics\" [6]. \n\nThe high complexity of platform trial designs requires sophisticated statistical methods to ensure \nproper randomization, interim analysis and robust criteria for success/futility assessment of each \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n33 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n \n\fEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\ntrial arm. The advantage for patients is that they receive a tailored therapy at an earlier time point \nand are less likely to have prolonged exposure to an ineffective treatment. \n\nA major concern of Health Authorities and Ethics Committees with platform trials is that, in theory, \nadditional arms to explore new treatment options can be added indefinitely and potentially result in \n\u201cnever-ending\u201d trials. So, it is important that in the master protocol and any sub-protocols the end \nof the clinical trial is defined, including how it will comply with legal obligations on reporting and trial \ntransparency. \n\nFigure 4: Example of a Master Protocol with a Platform Trial Design \n\nSource: FDA draft guidance on Master Protocols: Efficient Clinical Trial Design Strategies to Expedite \nDevelopment of Oncology Drugs and Biologics, Sept 2018 - Adapted from Abrams J et al., 2014, National \nCancer Institute\u2019s Precision Medicine Initiatives for the New National Clinical Trials Network, Am Soc Clin Oncol \nEduc Book: 71-6,  \n\n4.5 Approvals based on data generated via master protocols \n\nDespite the potential advantage of a master protocol in its flexibility and efficiency in drug \ndevelopment, to date only a small number of drugs have been approved and made available to \npatients based solely on pivotal data from umbrella, basket or platform trials. A master protocol \nprovides an opportunity to incorporate efficient approaches, such as a shared control arm and/or \nthe use of centralized data capture systems to enhance efficiency. \n\nThe potential of complex innovative clinical trial designs to support the approval of new treatments \nin an accelerated way is demonstrated by a handful of trials which have led to either the registration \nof new products or an extension of the product label (see Table A2 in Appendix).

However, the FDA \nseems to be more familiar with these types of designs and shows a greater acceptance of these \nnovel designs to support new submissions. \n\nInput received from EU regulators during recent stakeholder meetings (BfArM dialogue meeting on \ncomplex study designs, 22 Nov 2017; CTFG workshop Complex Clinical Trial Designs, 22 March 2018; \nvfa meeting on personalised medicine, 26 April 2018; CTFG stakeholder meeting 24 Oct 2018) seems \nto indicate that the Health Authorities in Europe are beginning to look at how best to support clinical \ntrials with umbrella/ basket and platform designs. The recently published CTFG recommendation \npaper as well as an article in Lancet Oncology [44] provides an insight into concerns that regulators \nmay raise when assessing complex trial designs, some of which are shared by other stakeholders \n(Table 6). For this reason, it is important that certain criteria are fulfilled when designing and \nconducting umbrella, basket or platform trials (Table 7). \n\n4.6 Regulatory considerations for conducting master protocol trials \n\nRecent meetings with Regulators and Ethics Committees have confirmed that they would like to be \ninvolved in the discussion of complex protocols with sponsors at an early time point. During the \nCTFG Stakeholder meetings held in Rome in March 2018 and in Bonn in October 2018, there was a \ndiscussion on how such early engagement with regulators can take place. Currently some Health \nAuthorities offer national scientific advice and there is the option to seek protocol advice from the \nEMA. However, given the multinational scope of many clinical trials, it would be desirable for a \nsponsor to have an EU-wide interaction with the Health Authorities in the countries foreseen for the \nconduct of a particular trial, which could potentially also involve the coordinating Ethics Committees. \nMulti-national Pre-CTA consultations for complex/innovative trials is especially important to: \n\n\u2022  Discuss the protocol and clearly define endpoints and goals of the trial \n\n\u2022  Clarify the ethical, scientific and methodological justification for conducting the trial under a \n\nmaster protocol \n\n\u2022  Provide opportunity to address questions \u2013 helps to understand the national competent \n\nauthority concerns \n\n\u2022  Explain decision rules to stop, expand or add an arm, agree on procedure for early \n\ntermination of one arm \n\n\u2022  Explain choice of comparators/background therapy \n\u2022  Discuss the role of DMCs (or other alternative bodies) with all the concerned member states \n\u2022  Anticipate any major review roadblocks \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n35 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n\fEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\nTable 6 \u2013 Examples of concerns regarding Master Protocols raised by Regulatory Authorities, Ethics \nCommittees and HTA bodies \n\nEthics Committee \nConcerns \n\n\u2022  Preclinical development is \nnot in the remit of Ethics \nCommittees therefore this \naspect was not \ncommented on in the \nmeetings \n\n\u2022 Protocols for complex trials \ncan be extremely complex \nand long and are a serious \nproblem for investigators \nand ECs when faced with \nshort review timelines. \n\n\u2022 Master protocols can \n\nrequire many individual \npatient leaflets for the \ndifferent indications or \ntreatments included in the \ntrial  \n\n\u2022 Patients need to be closely \ninvolved and well-informed \nduring these trials e.g. all \nchanges impacting risk/ \nbenefit (e.g. in case of \noutcome adapted \nrandomization to new study \narms).

The hypothesis must be scientifically \nsound and maintained throughout the trial. \n\n\u2022 Switches from exploratory to confirmatory designed objectives \n\nduring trial conduct without pre-specification cannot be \nconsidered as good science \n\n\u2022  As clinical trial authorization is assessed on a case by case \n\nbasis there needs to be a sound justification for each trial and \neach substantial amendment \n\nHTA Concerns: \n\u2022  Assessment of a medicine\u2019s additional benefit by HTA and \n\nPayers requires data on an appropriate comparator therapy. \nTherefore, it is difficult to perform this assessment if there is \nno approved comparator or any epidemiological or historical \ndata e.g. for therapies based on biomarkers. \n\n\u2022  The dynamic development of disease therapy means that new \n\nbiomarkers (e.g. ALK, BRAFV600, EGFR, PDL1) allow \nidentification of new patient sub-populations even as trials are \nongoing. However, there may not be data to show if the \nnormal standard therapy is relevant for these genetic \nsubgroups and can therefore be used as a comparator to \nassess additional benefit. \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n36 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\nTable 6 \u2013 Examples of concerns regarding Master Protocols raised by Regulatory Authorities, Ethics \nCommittees and HTA bodies (continued) \n\nEthics Committee \nConcerns \n\n\u2022  Master protocols ask for a \ncentral competent and \npowerful infrastructure is \nrequired at the sites, e.g. \nfor the molecular. \nscreening, administration, \nand organization \n\n\u2022  All master protocols are \ntypically combined with \nadaptive design elements \ni.e. prospectively planned \nmodifications of the trial \nprotocol based on first \nresults, which can increase \nthe risk of bias \n\n\u2022  Investigators may be able \nto draw conclusions from \nthe type of adaptation \nperformed during the trial \non the efficacy/ safety of \nthe IND, which can \nendanger the integrity of \nthe trial conduct and data. \n\nTrial design \n\nRegulatory Authority and HTA Concerns  \n\naspect \n\nPharmacology \n\n/ biomarkers \n\nStatistics \n\nRegulatory Authority Concerns: \n\u2022  Validation of companion diagnostics, marker positivity and \n\nclinical relevance \n\n\u2022  Many IMP profiles increase complexity and reporting \n\nresponsibilities and procedures for safety oversight with \nmultiple IMP suppliers are challenging. \n\n\u2022  Biomarker hierarchy and patient allocation in case of more \n\nthan one positive biomarker in a patient \n\nHTA Concerns: \n\u2022  Cancer site independent biomarker-based approvals (e.g. \nfor pembrolizumab) would currently be very difficult to \nsupport from an HTA/ payer perspective due to a lack of any \ncomparator therapy to support additional benefit. \n\n\u2022  How to ensure statistical integrity of a trial e.g. control of \nType I error probability (false positive) and effect on \nestimates \n\n\u2022  Need to ensure confidentiality of interim data if knowledge of \ndata can affect behavior of sponsor, investigators, and/or \ntrial subjects \n\n\u2022  Master protocols involve advanced statistics.

If several amendments were \nrequired to cover changes affecting different arms of a master protocol trial these would have to be \nsubmitted and approved sequentially, which could lead to practical problems in conducting the trial. \nTo mitigate this concern, it would be helpful to identify where protocols could include appropriate \ndecision criteria to reduce the need for substantial amendments, e.g. when transitioning from \ndifferent study phases, expanding the study to increase the number of patients at a recommended \ndose following dose escalation etc. \n\nParallel discussions on complex trials are also needed with HTA bodies and decision makers on \nreimbursement aspects to ensure the design and any treatment comparators are also acceptable \nfrom this perspective. However, experience to-date with EMA/HTA parallel scientific advice has \nshown that scheduling such meetings requires considerable advanced notice and planning due to \nthe limited number of HTA resources available to participate in such meetings. In the interest of \nstudy participants, it would be helpful to establish a less bureaucratic option for discussions with \nmultiple stakeholders on acceptability of a proposed design prior to the initiation of a study. \n\n5. Use of Historical Controls \n\n5.1 How to optimise clinical trial design in a challenging environment? \nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard to demonstrate efficacy in the \ncontext of marketing authorisations and reimbursement decisions on drugs. Ideally, there is the wish \nto obtain an unbiased estimate of the effect of the treatment being investigated compared to \nplacebo or to another active compound. The goal of obtaining an unbiased estimate of the size of \neffect is true in studies in small populations as well as large trials for common diseases. Thus, in \ndeveloping any treatment, a comparative randomised trial will usually be preferable but may not \nalways be possible. \n\nRCTs have well known limitations however, and there are situations where a RCT may not be feasible \nor ethical; e.g. for a new drug with very strong biological rationale in a biomarker-selected \npopulation of patients; for new drug demonstrating an unprecedented objective response rate in a \nsetting of high unmet need with no effective therapies; or for an already approved molecularly \ntargeted agent when being tested in a rare tumour histology expressing the appropriate biomarker. \nIn orphan diseases and areas of high unmet need, where subjects are scarce, or no effective \nstandard of care is available, RCTs are not always feasible and health authorities have demonstrated \nwillingness to accept evidence based on single arm trials, using historical control data to explicitly or \nimplicitly define a benchmark efficacy threshold. However, significant challenges also exist in more \ncommon disease areas, such as Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, where recruiting subjects for clinical trials is \nincreasingly difficult due to logistical and patient burden issues, resulting in increased clinical trial \ntimelines. Paediatric clinical studies are often required to fulfil a Paediatric Investigation Plan \nagreement with HAs, but may present recruitment difficulties, especially when alternative \ntreatments already exist. In therapeutic areas such as chronic kidney disease, where natural history \nof the disease and standard treatment options have remained stable for several years, there is an \naccumulating body of data from control arms of failed clinical development programmes which \ncould be considered predictive of control responses in future clinical trials. In this context, the \nbenefits of using existing control data are self-evident: fewer patients need to be enrolled in trials, \nthe value of data gleaned from those who do will be multiplied, and the efficiency and speed of \nclinical trials are increased.  \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n43 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n  \n\fEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\nThis section discusses some of the opportunities and challenges for clinical trial designs utilizing \nhistorical control data, focusing particularly on recent developments in trial designs using a \ncombination of historical and concurrent controls.

In their 10-year report [45] of experience of Conditional Marketing \nAuthorisations (CMA) published in September 2017, the EMA noted that \u2018Most studies (34/58) were \nrandomised multiple arm studies, but just over a third of studies consisted of a single arm. There \nwere relatively more singe arm studies in the oncology area (15/29) and relatively more randomised \nmultiple arm studies in infectious diseases area (18/23).\u2019 In 2016, the EMA explored further the use \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n45 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\nof single arm studies in oncology [46] as the basis for regulatory approval in order to identify \nwhether a more systematic approach could be developed. With reference to the ICH E10 guideline \n[47], it was mentioned that the use of external control design should be \u2018restricted to situations in \nwhich the effect of treatment is dramatic and the usual course of the disease highly predictable\u2019.  \n\nOnce approved under conditions, on the basis of a single arm study, it is also not uncommon that \nadditional supportive evidence is generated, which can help converting the marketing authorisation \ninto a standard marketing authorisation, and successfully support pricing and reimbursement. \n\nProspective single-arm clinical trial(s) could be sufficient for the registration of molecularly targeted \nagents (MTAs) for rare tumours, provided that these agents show rapid, durable, and clinically \nmeaningful activity, preferably together with positive exploratory health-related quality of life \n(HRQOL) and favourable (or at least acceptable) tolerability. As illustrated with crizotinib [48] or \nosimertinib [49], new MTAs will also need to demonstrate these findings in a prospective clinical trial \nof a properly selected patient population based on strong biological rationale, possibly with an \nappropriate companion diagnostic test for molecular patient selection in order to secure regulatory \napproval of the MTA. Of note, both crizotinib and osimertinib, while initially approved under \nconditions with a limited data package, were subsequently completed with additional evidence \nwhich has helped switching from a conditional marketing authorisation to a full marketing \nauthorisation. \n\nA key issue to support regulatory approval of single-arm trials is the identification and use of \nappropriate external evidence, e.g. historical controls or indirect comparisons.   While it is \nacknowledged that high unmet need and early (conditional) approval with high uncertainty are \nfrequent in disease areas such as oncology, since it is often the only possible way forward, the \ncontribution of single arm studies to health technology assessment (HTA) remains a challenge. Not \nall HTA bodies and payers accept single-arm studies as a basis for their relative effectiveness \nassessments. This might mean that regulatory approvals based on single-arm studies have less \nchance of receiving reimbursement in different countries, which is an essential step in facilitating \npatient access. As an example, in 2014 NICE published a review [50] of Appraisals using single arm \ntrials, and concluded that drugs are unlikely to be approved by NICE on the basis of single-arm trial \nevidence (where used as the primary source of efficacy evidence) unless there is substantial \nsupporting evidence from other sources (e.g., multiple single-arm trials) and/or unless there are \nother factors (e.g., high burden and unmet need). Indeed, for HTA bodies used to assessing the \ninternal validity of non-randomised studies (NRS), there is the perception that \u201cthe inclusion of NRS \nmight mislead researchers into the false belief that RCTs are not worthwhile to perform, while \nrecognizing they may play a greater role in the assessment of safety. For EUnetHTA, the decision to \nperform such studies should be made only after careful consideration of all advantages and \ndisadvantages.2 [51]  There are examples where a product was approved under conditions by the \nregulators based on a single arm study, and which was then rejected by HTA/payers, which had thus \na noticeable impact on patients\u2019 access [52]. \n\nThis position is also shared beyond Europe, as shown by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality, which mentioned in their Research White Paper [53] that the reporting of inclusion or \nexclusion of single group studies in the comparative effectiveness review (CER) of the Effective \nHealth Care Programme was sub-optimal. The review of published CERs indicated that single group \nstudies were commonly included in CERs, but the rationale for including them was not consistently \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n46 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n\fEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\nreported, and the methods relevant to their use not clearly defined. Clarity and transparency in the \nrationale for including or excluding single group studies in CERs should therefore be promoted.  \n\nMore recently, the IMI ADAPT SMART consortium as part of their work on the Evidence Generation \nthroughout the life cycle, identified \u2018single arm studies\u2019 as a topic [54] for a future EU research \nproject,  to develop a methodological, structured framework and the necessary tools (guidelines, \nsoftware, interactive online systems) that allows to decide whether it is appropriate to provide \npatient access to a novel treatment based on evidence generated by one (or multiple) single-arm \nstudies.  \n\n5.3 Historical borrowing designs combining historical and concurrent controls \nMuch of the debate over the relative merits of randomized or historical controls has been \npredicated on the assumption that a trial can only have one or the other.  As far back as 1976, \nPocock proposed a quantitative approach for the combination of historical and concurrently \nrandomised control data, together with a set of operational criteria for determining the acceptability \nof historical controls, arguing that \u201cthis should lead to a more efficient use of patients in the \nexecution of clinical trials\u201d. Pocock\u2019s idea of combining historical and randomised controls has \ngained relatively little traction until very recently. New statistical developments, particularly those \nusing Bayesian methods, have facilitated the approach of combining the two sources of control data: \nthese methods allow the information derived from the historical controls to be down-weighted in \naccord with the amount of \u201cdrift\u201d (i.e. difference between the concurrent and historical control data, \nas well as enabling statistical covariate adjustments for differences between known baseline patient \ncharacteristics that may lead to different responses in historical and concurrent controls [55]. Use of \nsuch methods helps to minimise the risk of biased treatment effect estimates due to inappropriate \nborrowing, although potential for inflation of false positive rates remains a key challenge. Extensive \nclinical trial simulations are needed to inform the trial design and calculate the key risks and trade-\noffs between reduced sample size and timelines, gains in precision of treatment effect estimates and \nrisks of bias and type 1 error.       \n\nA key driver for the renewed interest in designs combining historical and randomised controls is that \nsources of historical data (as well as computational resources to store, search and process such data) \nhave become much more readily available over time. Most major pharmaceutical companies have \nan external data sharing initiative, and there are increasing efforts at data-sharing among various \nconsortia: Project Data Sphere [56] for oncology trials and CAMD [57] for Alzheimer\u2019s trials are two \nsuch examples in specific disease areas, whilst in 2015, TransCelerate initiated the development of a \ndatabase containing placebo and standard of care (PSoC) data from completed clinical trials across \nmultiple disease areas, with the aim to enhance innovative drug product development by better \ninforming clinical safety interpretation and trial design [58]. The PSoC database will enable \npharmaceutical R&D companies to share clinical data in a non-competitive, collaborative \nenvironment to enhance the development of new medicines. Recent discussions with regulatory \nagencies also indicate an increased openness to consideration of supplementation with historical \ncontrols. As a result of the PSoC work, TransCelerate published a white paper [59] which provides \nguidance on the potential applications of this large historical PSoC database, and examples for the \npossible implementation of historic data in seven specific applications (use cases). TransCelerate also \norganised a workshop in 2018 which aimed to develop ongoing discussions with Health Authorities \nand other key stakeholders addressing the challenges of utilizing historical clinical data in \nconfirmatory trials.  \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n47 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n \n\fEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\nTable 9 summarises the initial list of criteria and considerations that was developed for the \nworkshop; TransCelerate are currently refining and developing these criteria to create a guidance \ndocument with examples which can support utilization of historical data to be acceptable for \nsubmission and to ensure that the use is appropriate and objective.    \n\nTable 9: Considerations for historical borrowing \n\nCriteria \n\nPoints to consider \n\nDisease-specific \nconsiderations \n\nData availability \nand quality \n\nOperational \nconsiderations \n\nRisk-benefit \nassessments \n\nMethodology \nconsiderations \n\nReporting \n\n\u2022  What factors would allow us to judge in advance whether the use of \n\nhistorical data is appropriate? \no  Would these factors change for a rare vs. a more common disease, \n\nand if so how? \n\n\u2022  Are there disease areas/endpoints that are more/less appropriate for this \n\napproach? \n\n\u2022  Unmet medical needs/ Time sensitive to find a treatment? \n\u2022  What historical data are available?   \n\no  What studies containing target clinical trial population are available?  \n\nIs the data at the patient-level or is it published aggregate information? \n\u2022  Consider similarity of trial population/conduct/design/visit timing, imbalance \n\nin covariates. \n\n\u2022  Quality of the historical data \n\u2022  Are similar assessments of endpoints or treatment evaluations available? \n\u2022  Currency/recency \n\u2022  Variability/drift \n\u2022  Does the context require reducing the length of patient recruitment and \nminimizing participant burden by using historical data supplementation? \n\n\u2022  Are there a minimum number of concurrent controls that need to be \n\nmaintained in a clinical trial? \n\n\u2022  Change of standard of care?

There are \nnumerous issues relating to disease registries that are outside the remit of this paper. \n\n5.4 Regulatory considerations for historical control borrowing designs \nAs yet, there is very limited information in the public domain about regulatory experience of \nhistorical borrowing designs combining historical and concurrent controls, although several \nexamples of the use of such designs in early-phase development, and as part of ongoing late-phase \ndevelopment programs, have been shared publicly at recent scientific conferences. No guidance \ndocuments directly relating to such historical control borrowing designs for drug approvals are \ncurrently available in either Europe or USA, although the role of historical controls is mentioned in \nother guidance documents for medical device trials. These include the FDA\u2019s Guidance for the Use of \nBayesian Statistics in Medical Device Clinical Trials (2010) [62], which states that Bayesian methods \ncan be useful for combining historical controls with concurrent controls by using historical controls \nas prior information for the concurrent control. Another more recent FDA guidance (FDA, 2017 [63]) \ncites where Real World Evidence may potentially be applied to enhance understanding of medical \ndevice performance at different points in the total product life cycle, including as a historical control, \na prior in a Bayesian trial, or as one source of data in a hierarchical model or a hybrid data synthesis.  \n\n6. Future Considerations \n\nWhile the EU and USA regulatory authorities are relatively mature in their consideration of adaptive \ndesigns, more work is being done in this field.  In the EU, two workshops on adaptive designs in \nconfirmatory trials have taken place (2007, 2009) in which FDA participated, the first of which took \nplace just after the EMEA published its reflection paper on the topic (2007) and the second, which \nfocused on case studies and good practices, took place just prior to the publication of draft USA \nguidance (2010).  To promote and increase awareness and a common understanding across different \nstakeholders of the full range of innovation now possible in clinical trials, regulatory agencies could \ndevelop videos describing types of trial design.  In addition, additional workshops similar to the one \nled by FDA on complex innovative designs in other countries would be valuable to enable different \nstakeholders to debate the value, use and acceptability of these designs. \n\nThe output from the planned pilot programme of sponsor-FDA engagement, on proposed complex \ntrial protocols, will inform the development of a single draft guidance on complex adaptive trial \ndesigns (due September 2019).  By September 2020, FDA is committed to updating relevant \nprocedural documents to reflect the use of such designs in decision making.  Separately, draft \nguidance on model informed drug development is also scheduled (by September 2019).   \n\nThe significant progress made in this field is such that development of a new ICH guideline on \nadaptive designs [64], reflecting the importance of this topic amongst a more international groups of \nregulatory authorities.  In a recent review of the methodological and data developments that have \nacted as enablers for historical control borrowing designs concluded that \u201cthe industry and \nregulatory science has matured to the point where high quality data exists to support these \napproaches; the statistical methods have evolved to provide a robust understanding of risk; and our \nevolution to a patient-centric model demands that we leverage these methods more broadly\u201d.    \n\nGetting direct patient input into study designs and modifying designs accordingly will likely become \nthe new normal, particularly as the growing use of patient-facing digital technologies provides new \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n49 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n\fEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\nways to engage with patients, as well as changing the types of endpoints and ways in which data are \ncollected in clinical trials [65].  Obtaining feedback from patients or patient advocacy groups on what \nprocedures and how many procedures patients feel they can tolerate, and incorporating this \nfeedback into study protocols reduces the number of procedures to those essential and could \nprevent and/or reduce drop outs and the extent of missing data to assess study outcomes. Patient \ninsights to help understand reasons for recruitment challenges may support use of historical control \ndata to reduce number of patients exposed to placebo in new trials. Patient input into informed \nconsent forms can ensure these are user friendly with a trend for patients to provide their consent \nelectronically.  Similarly, the need for patients to attend sites for assessments is reducing as data \ncollection is being done remotely with technology such as e-dairies and activity monitors as \nexamples.  This could also lead to increasing retention of patients in clinical trials. Levitan et al [66] \nhave shown that such patient engagement activities have the potential to add considerable financial \nvalue for sponsors in terms of return on investment, as well as improving patient experience.   \n\nNew digital technologies for data capture and sharing of both clinical trial and real-world data, \ncombined with growing use of AI and machine learning tools to extract patterns from these data, \noffer the potential to build and continuously update predictive models of disease natural history or \npatient outcomes under existing treatment options. Such models could be used to generate \nsynthetic control arm information to supplement or replace concurrent controls in RCTs; prototype \nexamples of synthetic controls are already being developed for use in early phase oncology clinical \ntrials [67]. \n\nUse of external/historical controls and Bayesian designs is one of the areas identified as of being of \ninterest under the USA\u2019s PDUFA VI Complex Innovative Designs Pilot programme, and the recent \nstakeholder workshops and meetings of the TransCelerate PSoC working group with FDA and EMA \nreflect a willingness by regulatory authorities to consider greater use of historical borrowing designs. \nA fundamental consideration is whether the historical data are of sufficient quality and relevance to \ninform or support a particular regulatory decision. Decisions about quality and relevance of historical \ndata must be made on a case by case basis, and sponsors need to engage early with regulatory \nauthorities to discuss this.    \n\n7. Conclusions \n\nInnovation in clinical trial design is transforming evidence generation in drug development.  Whilst \nadaptive designs and designs enabling the target population to be enriched have been available for \nmany years, their use has substantially increased in recent years.  The use of master protocols to \ninvestigate either multiple treatments or multiple diseases in the same clinical trial is quickly \ngrowing, as are designs augmenting or replacing a control arm with historical data.   \n\nThe regulators have recognised the need for more complex designs to increase the efficiency and \neffectiveness of clinical trials whilst maintaining high quality data for regulatory decision making.  \nThe acceptability of data from innovative or more complex clinical trials is essential to allow new \nmedicines to be available as treatment options for patients with unmet medical needs.  Whilst there \nhas been and there will be significant interactions between Industry and regulators on guidelines, \nrecommendations and best practices for innovative clinical trial designs, there has been limited \ndiscussions with HTA agencies.  Additional focus is needed to ensure all key stakeholders align on the \nuse of novel clinical trial designs. \n\nEFPIA\tBrussels\tOffice\t\nLeopold\tPlaza\tBuilding\t  Rue\tdu\tTr\u00f4ne\t108\t\t\nB-1050\tBrussels\t  Belgium\t\nTel:\t+\t32\t(0)2\t626\t25\t55\t\nwww.efpia.eu\t \tinfo@efpia.eu \n\n50 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\n \n \n \n \n\fEFPIA \n\n  7th March 2020 \n\n Innovation in Clinical Trial Design \n\nDraft \n\nFinal \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nThe review and support of the Clinical Development Expert Group (CDEG) prior to the formation of \nthe Clinical Research Expert Group is acknowledged. \n\nReferences \n\n1.
