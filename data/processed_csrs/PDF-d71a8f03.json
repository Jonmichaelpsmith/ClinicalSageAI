Approximately \n120 subjects were planned to be enrolled.  \n\nThe Baseline visit was conducted 0 to 28 days (4 weeks) after the Screening visit.  At the \nmorning (before midday) Baseline visit, a subject\u2019s IOP had to be \uf0b322 mmHg in at least \n1 eye.  To ensure that systemic exposure was not too high in this pediatric population, \nenrollment was staged by age groups (0 to <3, 3 to <12, and 12 to 18 years old).  \nRandomization was stratified by age (0 to <3, 3 to <12, and 12 to 18 years old), diagnosis \n(2 levels: primary congenital glaucoma [PCG] or non-PCG) and IOP value of the study eye \n(3 levels: <27, 27 to 31, and >31 mmHg) at the Baseline visit.  Subjects were randomly \nassigned in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the 2 treatment groups (latanoprost or timolol).\n\nFollowing randomization, follow-up visits occurred at Weeks 1, 4, and 12.  If during the \nstudy the Investigator determined that the IOP was not controlled (eg, IOP \u226536 mmHg), \ntherapy could be switched to open-label concomitant therapy of latanoprost 0.005% at \napproximately 8 PM (\uf0b1 30 minutes) and timolol 0.5% (or optionally 0.25% for subjects \nyounger than 3 years old) twice daily at approximately 8 AM (\uf0b1 30 minutes) and 8 PM \n(\uf0b130 minutes). If the therapy was changed to the concomitant therapy at Weeks 1 or 4, the \nsubject was asked to return to the clinic for a visit at Week 2 or 5 respectively.  If at Week 2 \nor 5 IOP was not adequately controlled (eg, IOP \u2265 36 mmHg), the subject was discontinued.  \nThe IOP measurements for all follow-up visits occurred at 10 AM (\uf0b1 1.5 hours).  \n\nThe schedule of activities is presented in Table 1.  \n\nTemplate version 1.0 \n\nPage 2\n\n090177e18544dd98\\Approved\\Approved On: 25-Apr-2014 19:38 \fPublic Disclosure Synopsis\nProtocol A6111137 \u2013 11 April 2014 \u2013 Final\n\nTable 1.\n\nSchedule of Activities\n\nProtocol Activity\n\nScreen\n\nDay 0 \n(Baseline)\n\nWk 1 Wk 2a Wk 4 Wk 5a Week 12/\nEnd of \nTreatment\n\nWeek 13\nFollow-Up; \nEnd of \nStudy\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\n\nXf\nXf\n\nX\nXg\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\nXd\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nInformed \nConsent,demographics, \nmed history, & \ninclusion/exclusion \ncriteriab\nPhysical examination\nChange in medications\nRandomization\nResting pulse and BPc\nAlertness\nRefraction (cycloplegic \nwhere appropriate)\nVisual acuitye\nVisual fieldse\nHyperemia assessmenth\nPupil Diameter\nCorneal Diameter\nBiomicroscopy (anterior\nsegment)h\nPachymetrye,i\nGonioscopy\nIOP measurementj\nOphthalmoscopy \n(posterior segment)\nDiscontinue Previous \nOcular Antihypertensive \nMeds\nDispense study \nmedication\nRetrieve study \nmedication\nDispense open label \nconcomitant medication \n(if applicable)\nRetrieve open label \nconcomitant medication \n(if applicable)\nAdverse events\nAll visits allowed \uf0b1 2 day window after Baseline.

Parents or legal guardians \n(primary caretaker) of subjects administered 1 drop of study medication in each eye once \ndaily in the morning and once daily in the evening for the 84 day treatment duration \n(administration was to occur at consistent times throughout the study).  \n\nEfficacy Endpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint: \n\n\uf0b7 Mean change from baseline IOP in the study eye at Week 12.  \n\nSecondary Endpoints: \n\n\uf0b7 Mean IOP change from baseline in the study at each visit (Week 1, Week 4, Week 12 and \n\nWeeks 2 or 5 when applicable).  \n\n\uf0b7 Mean IOP level in the study eye at each visit (Baseline, Week 1, Week 4, Week 12 and \n\nWeeks 2 or 5 when applicable).  \n\n\uf0b7 Proportion of subjects with at least a 15% IOP reduction from baseline in the study eye \n\n(for responder analysis).  \n\n\uf0b7 Proportion of subjects discontinuing therapy due to a drug-related adverse experience.  \n\nSafety Evaluations:  Safety evaluations included assessment of adverse events (AEs), visual \nacuity and refraction, conjunctival hyperemia, pachymetry, pupil diameter, corneal diameter, \nbiomicroscopy (anterior segment), gonioscopy, biomicroscopy posterior segment \n(ophthalmoscopy), visual field, vital signs measurements, and a measurement of alertness.  \n\nStatistical Methods:  The intention to treat (ITT) population was defined as all subjects who \nwere randomized into the study and received at least 1 dose of study medication.  \nThe per protocol (PP) population was restricted to subjects with no major protocol violations \nwho received at least 1 week of study medication and had at least Week 1 IOP measurements \nduring the 12-week treatment period.  \n\nThe primary efficacy endpoint was the mean IOP change from baseline in the study eye at \nWeek 12.  For subjects who switched to open-label concomitant therapy or discontinued \nstudy prior to Week 12, their last IOP measurements prior to the switch or study \ndiscontinuation was used to impute the IOP value at Week 12 using the Last Observation \nCarried Forward (LOCF) method.  This applied to both the PP and ITT populations.  \n\nTemplate version 1.0 \n\nPage 5\n\n090177e18544dd98\\Approved\\Approved On: 25-Apr-2014 19:38 \fPublic Disclosure Synopsis\nProtocol A6111137 \u2013 11 April 2014 \u2013 Final\n\nFor the primary endpoint, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment and \nbaseline diagnosis as factors and baseline IOP as a covariate was used to estimate the \ndifference in IOP reduction at Week 12 between latanoprost and timolol.  The corresponding \np-value and 95% CI of the mean difference were also calculated.  \n\nBefore the ANCOVA model was fitted for the primary efficacy endpoint, a test for \nparallelism was performed to ensure the ANCOVA model without the interaction terms \namong treatment group, baseline diagnosis and baseline IOP was appropriate for the primary \nefficacy data analysis.  Note: The results indicated that a statistical model with heterogeneous \nregression slopes for different treatment groups within different diagnosis subgroups would \nbe a better fit to the study data.\n\nThe primary efficacy analysis population for determination of non-inferiority was based on \nthe PP population and the primary efficacy analysis population for determination of \nsuperiority was based on the ITT population.\n\nSecondary Endpoint Analyses:\n\nThe same ANCOVA model with treatment and baseline diagnosis as factors and baseline \nIOP as a covariate was used to estimate the difference in IOP reduction at each visit between \nlatanoprost and timolol.  The corresponding p-value and 95% CI of the mean difference was \nalso calculated.  \n\nIf a subject\u2019s IOP reduction in the study eye was greater than or equal to a 15% reduction \nfrom baseline at both Weeks 4 and 12, then this subject was classified as a responder.  A \nsubject with an IOP reduction in the study eye less than 15% reduction was classified as a \nnonresponder.  \n\nSubgroup Analyses:  All efficacy analyses were also performed for the PCG and non-PCG \nsubgroups within the PP and ITT populations.  \n\nFor the subgroup analyses within the baseline diagnosis groups (PCG and non-PCG), the \nANCOVA model had only treatment as the factor and baseline IOP as a covariate.  For the \nresponder analysis, a Pearson\u2019s chi-square test was used to evaluate the treatment difference.  \n\nRESULTS\n\nSubject Disposition and Demography: Subject disposition is summarized in Table 3.
