While\n16 (21%) of CSRs contained completed case report\nforms, these were accessible to us in only one case\n(765 pages representing 16 individuals). Compression\nfactors ranged between 1 and 8805.\nConclusions: Clinical study reports represent a\nhitherto mostly hidden and untapped source of detailed\nand exhaustive data on each trial. They should be\nconsulted by independent parties interested in a\ndetailed record of a clinical trial, and should form the\nbasic unit for evidence synthesis as their use is likely\nto minimise the problem of reporting bias. We cannot\nsay whether our sample is representative and whether\nour conclusions are generalisable to an undefined and\nundefinable population of CSRs.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nto provide\nSystematic reviews are thought\none of\nthe most robust ways to evaluate\nthe effects of healthcare interventions.

The ICH guidelines \u2018structure and content of\nclinical study reports\u201919 (see online supplementary appen-\ndix 1) are known by the document code \u2018E3\u2019. They were\nformalised in 1995 \u2018to assist sponsors in the development\nof a report that is complete, free from ambiguity, well orga-\nnised and easy [for regulators] to review\u2019.19 E3 has not\nbeen edited or changed since 1995.\n\nCSRs are but one category of information that is trans-\nmitted from study sponsors to regulators (\ufb01gure 1), but\nare important as they contain substantially more informa-\ntion and detail on the intervention being tested than pub-\nlished versions of the same trial. The wealth of information\nmay be sought with increasing frequency by researchers\nappraising single trials, entire trial programmes, or by\nthose synthesising evidence.17 20 We are aware of two\nrecent examples of systematic reviews of the effects of phar-\nmaceuticals carried out using CSRs and other regulatory\nmaterial.12 21 One group also concluded that journal publi-\ncations insuf\ufb01ciently report clinical trials.22\n\nDespite CSRs\u2019 potential\n\nimportance little is known\nabout their structure and content outside of those indivi-\nduals with direct involvement in regulatory processes.\nThis knowledge gap may hinder development of\nmethods for fair and reliable appraisal of CSRs and\n\ntheir use in evidence synthesis. We are not aware of any\ninstruments speci\ufb01cally designed for appraising CSRs.\nLack of visibility may also hinder understanding of\nthe complexity of the organisation and the reporting of\nclinical trials.\n\nWe carried out an exploratory review to describe the\nstructure and content of a non-random sample of CSRs.\nBy describing the contents of CSRs, this research seeks\nto transform CSRs from an obscure document only\nknown to regulators and industry into a more widely\nknown and accessible document. Our long-term inten-\ntion is to improve the credibility of research synthesis by\nfacilitating a move from the level of detail found in\njournal articles to the level of detail found in regulatory\ndocuments, thus guiding clinicians and other decision\nmakers at all levels.\n\nMETHODS\nWe obtained CSRs from public sources, as follows:\n1. Requesting from EMA, under\n\nits Freedom of\nInformation (FOI) policy, CSRs for manufacturer-\nsponsored trials of the 10 best-selling prescription-\nbound products in the USA in 2010.23\n\n2.

We did\nnot submit requests under the Freedom of Information\nAct to the FDA, because such requests can take years to be\nful\ufb01lled and\u2014if ful\ufb01lled\u2014may be heavily redacted.24\n\nWe did not draw a random sample of CSRs as there is\nno known sampling frame. No one knows how many\nreports have been written by intervention category as\nthere is no central register of CSRs. Through familiarity\nwith CSRs for oseltamivir and zanamivir, which were\nincluded in one of our Cochrane reviews,12 we devel-\noped and piloted a data extraction sheet designed to\ncapture the salient characteristics of CSRs. We created a\nlist of around 40 potential sections we expected to \ufb01nd,\ngenerated directly from elements speci\ufb01ed in E3. For\neach element\nin the list, we checked whether the\nobtained CSRs included that section (con\ufb01rmed either\nby direct identi\ufb01cation of the section or an indication\nthe section existed based on the CSRs\u2019 table of con-\ntents), whether we had access to it and its page length.\nBecause of previous dif\ufb01culties we had accessing CSRs\nappendices, we also recorded whether sections were\nlisted as appendices or not. The page length was calcu-\nlated either by directly counting the pages or by estimat-\ning their size from the table of contents of each report,\nand was used as a crude proxy for the level of detail\navailable. The page lengths were rounded up to the next\ninteger, and were summarised by reporting medians and\nranges. We also included questions relating to trial regis-\ntration and authorship. Our (blank) data extraction\nsheet is in online supplementary appendix 2.\n\nAll variables from CSRs were \ufb01rst extracted in single.\nWe subsequently audited each other\u2019s extractions, check-\ning the accurateness of the information. We chose to\npresent elements analogous with those that\ntypically\nappear in trials reported in scienti\ufb01c journals including\nthe study synopsis (a brief summary of the study), the\nstudy protocol (written prospectively, describing the study\nmethods), ef\ufb01cacy and safety evaluations (a narrative\nsummary of the ef\ufb01cacy and safety results of the study,\nincluding tables and \ufb01gures), as well as attached tables.\nWe also included elements rarely found in journal publi-\ncations: sample (blank) and completed case report forms\n(CRFs are paper or electronic forms designed to capture\nprespeci\ufb01ed ef\ufb01cacy and safety related information\n\nfor each study participant), the statistical analysis plan (a\nprospectively written narrative and/or statistical code\nindicating how trial data will be analysed) and individual\nparticipant ef\ufb01cacy and safety listings. The corresponding\nE3 section numbers are listed in table 2. Disagreements\nwere resolved by discussion.\n\nOur uncorrected (original) and corrected extraction\nsheets as well as audit records are available upon request\nfrom the corresponding author.\n\nWe calculated a compression factor for published\ntrials which we de\ufb01ned as the ratio of CSR page length\ncompared to the page length of the same trial as pub-\nlished in scienti\ufb01c journals. The objective of this metric\nwas to convey a rough sense of how much information\npresent in CSRs may be condensed (\u2018compressed\u2019) in\nshort journal publications, in consideration of CSRs\u2019 far\ngreater length and level of detail. The size ( page\nlength) re\ufb02ects the level of detail as well as the presence\nof many elements such as protocols and their amend-\nments, randomisation lists, statistical analysis plans, certi-\n\ufb01cates of analysis and extra data on subpopulations. We\nhave demonstrated12 that these elements are essential\nfor understanding and appraising a trial. The compres-\nsion factor is a crude measure of how much is com-\npressed or simply left out of each publication which will\naffect the reliability of the appraisal and interpretation\nof trials. Trial publications were searched for in multiple\nsources\u2014clinical\nregisters, published systematic\nreviews and correspondence with sponsors. Because in\nmost cases we could not access all parts of all CSRs (and\ntherefore do not know their complete page length), we\ncalculated \u2018conservative\u2019 compression factors as well as\n\u2018realistic\u2019 compression factors.\n\u2018Conservative\u2019 compres-\nsion factors were calculated on a trial by trial basis using\nthe total number of pages in CSRs available to us\ndivided by the length of journal reports for that same\ntrial, whereas \u2018realistic\u2019 compression factors were based\non the true total page length of the CSRs.\n\ntrial\n\nnatural\n\nRESULTS\nWe identi\ufb01ed 84 documents believed to be CSRs for 14\ncompounds. These covered therapeutic and biological\ninterventions including antipsychotics, antidepressants,\nanti-in\ufb02ammatory\nantivirals,\nantiarthritics,\nagents, pandemic in\ufb02uenza vaccines, statins, erythro-\npoietins and antiplatelet compounds. We included\nEnglish-language summaries of two Japanese oseltamivir\nstudies ( JV15823 and JV15824) as they had been pre-\nsented to EMA in this form. We excluded documents\nwhich were sections of CSRs that nonetheless contained\ninsuf\ufb01cient\ninformation to understand the overall\nF1D-LC-HGAV,\ncontent of\nF1D-MC-HGAJ and F1D-MC-HGAO) and three docu-\nments which we had originally classi\ufb01ed as CSRs but\nwere not (reboxetine 14, 22 and 37). This left us with 78\nCSRs (144 610 pages) (\ufb01gure 2). The median pages\nobtained per CSR was 644 (range 9\u201315 440). Only 4 of\n\n(olanzapine\n\nthe CSRs\n\nDoshi P, Jefferson T.

EMA\nreported not holding studies for esomeprazole magne-\nsium (Nexium), Advair Diskus, quetiapine fumarate\n(Seroquel), montelukast\nsodium (Singulair), epoetin\nalfa (Epogen) and simvastatin.\n\nAll of the 78 included CSRs contained a synopsis\n(median page length 5 pages). The ef\ufb01cacy evaluation\nwas identi\ufb01able and directly accessible in 76 (97%;\nmedian length 13.5 pages) and safety in 77 (99%;\nmedian length 17 pages). The attached tables were like-\nwise present in 63 (81%) CSRs, with a median of 337\npages long (range 1\u20133665). Seventy-three CSRs (94%)\nreported including the study protocol. In the 40 proto-\ncols we could access, the median page length was 62. We\nfound blank CRFs included in 68 (87%) CSRs. Of the 33\nblank CRFs we could directly access, the median length\nwas 133 pages (range 14\u2013981).

Of those for which we\ncould directly access the content (n=37), the median page\nlength was 15 (range 3\u201385). Individual ef\ufb01cacy and safety\nlistings were included in 53 (69%) and 62 (81%) CSRs,\nrespectively. The median page length was 447 (range 15\u2013\n21 698) for ef\ufb01cacy and 109.5 (range 2\u201310 954) for safety.\n\nA summary is presented in table 2.\nAll trial reports in our review were sponsored by the\n\npharmaceutical industry.\n\nMedian conservative compression factors\n\nranged\nbetween 1 and 1221.

All CSRs contained a table\nof contents (as speci\ufb01ed in E3 section 3); this, together\nwith optical character recognition (to enable searching the\nfull text of the scanned documents) and the occasional\nneed to combine multiple \ufb01les to create a single docu-\nment, substantially improved the ease of navigating CSRs.\nDespite the size of our non-random sample,\n\nis\nunclear whether our conclusions are generalisable to all\nother CSRs.

In a study that dir-\nectly compared the adequacy of reporting between\njournal articles and CSRs, the authors found that com-\nthan 40% of\nplete information regarding greater\nmethods items were only available in CSRs.22 The level\nof detail found in CSRs thus far surpass the level of\ndetail available in journal publications, and as such they\nare prime candidates for the next basic currency of evi-\ndence synthesis and appraisal of a trial. Given the EMA\u2019s\nnew policy of making such documents publicly available,\naccess to these documents is now relatively straightfor-\nward.26 However, including CSRs in systematic reviews is\nlabor-intensive, given their size and complexity.12\n\nAccessing complete CSRs\nAlthough CSRs may trump other forms of trial reporting\nin the public domain (such as conference abstracts or\njournal publications), serious limitations remain. Despite\nin almost all\nobtaining 144 610 pages for 78 CSRs,\nto the CSRs\u2019\ninstances, we lacked complete access\nnumerous appendices. Even for the sole complete CSR\nwe obtained (Arthronat MA-CT-10\u2013002), case report\nforms were provided for only 20% of participants. The\nArthronat text does not provide a reason for this omis-\nsion, but it re\ufb02ects the vagueness of the relevant section\nthe E3 guidance (16.3.2) which does not de\ufb01ne\nof\n\u2018other CRFs submitted\u2019. Also, we could only access the\noriginal trial protocol in 40 (51%) of 78 CSRs obtained.\nThis is important because trial protocols, written prior\nto patient enrollment in a trial, are an important way to\nguard against reporting biases.27 28\n\nWe could obtain individual patient listings in only a\nminority of cases despite con\ufb01rming their inclusion in the\nmajority of CSRs (table 2). This may be a signi\ufb01cant\n\nlimitation, as the E3 speci\ufb01es that \u2018the report with its\nappendices should also provide enough individual patient\ndata, including the demographic and baseline data, and\ndetails of analytical methods, to allow replication of the crit-\nical analyses.\u201919 Unavailability was possibly owing to the fact\nthat EMA allows manufacturers to submit CSRs omitting a\nnumber of appendices including individual patient data\nand case report forms (which EMA states should be avail-\nable within 48 h, if requested).29 In the case of oseltamivir,\nthe primary drug analysed in a Cochrane review we con-\nducted,12 the manufacturer refused to share with us report\nappendices not submitted to EMA,30 and EMA declined\nAlthough FDA likely pos-\nrequesting them on our behalf.\nsesses more complete CSRs and patient-level data, it histor-\nically has\ntrade secret and/or\ncon\ufb01dential.31\u201333 EMA is therefore at present the only\n\ntreated such data as\n\n8\n\nTable 3 Conservative and realistic compression factors\n\nPharmaceutical\n\nStudies\npublished in\njournals, n\n\nMean\ncompression\nfactor (range)\n\n1\n5\n1\n2\n1\n12\n2\n5\n8\n\n672\n11 (4\u201319)\n41\n488 (367\u2013609)\n19\n195 (1\u20131221)\n578 (352\u2013803)\n88 (9\u2013245)\n54 (28\u201392)\n\nConservative compression factors\nAripiprazole\nClopidogrel\nEpoetin alfa\nFluad\nGSK H5N1 vaccine\nOseltamivir\nQuetiapine\nReboxetine\nZanamivir\nRealistic compression factors\nArthronat*\nClopidogrel\nParoxetine\nA ratio of clinical study report page length to corresponding journal\npublication page length.\n*The Arthronat trial has not yet been published.

This is under-\nstandable considering that CSRs are a written/archival\nformat, but because EMA does not accept SAS format\ndata \ufb01les,35 36 the industry standard, third-party access to\ndatabases of patient-level data remains elusive. We see\nno compelling reason why all regulators should not\nrequest these from sponsors and make them publicly\nlistings\navailable. Whether availability of\nand CRFs, with its attendant laborious analysis, would\nincrease our understanding of the trial and its results is\nunclear. But there is at least one case where the reanaly-\nsis of CRFs added invaluable knowledge to that already\navailable in CSRs.37\n\nindividual\n\nThe public\u2013private debate\nOne manufacturer has claimed that the non-release of\ncase report forms is motivated by concerns over protect-\ning participants\u2019 con\ufb01dentiality.38 Nothing we have seen\nso far corroborates this claim, however an ongoing EMA\nworking group is speci\ufb01cally discussing issues related to\nprotecting participants\u2019 con\ufb01dentiality. Based on current\ndocument releases and position statements, however, it\nappears that EMA has deemed case report forms and\nindividual patient listings to be, in principle, releasable\nreview).39\nin their\nFurthermore, individual patient listings are intended to\nduplicate information contained in \ufb01lled case report\nforms. The release of case report forms would ensure\nthe accuracy of individual patient listings with little add-\nitional risk to patient con\ufb01dentiality. Moreover, extra\nchecks such as registration of protocols by bona \ufb01de\nresearch groups could deter any inappropriate use. We\nalso believe that the sheer bulk of the forms act as a\ndeterrent against malice.\n\na preliminary\n\nentirety\n\n(after\n\nSize matters\nOur range of compression factors shows the scale of\nselection and synthesis which must (consciously or\nunconsciously) occur in the process of\ntransforming\nCSRs into journal-length articles. We found a strong\nstructure and\nresemblance in detail, page length,\npurpose between the short synopsis section of CSRs and\n\nreports of trials as published in scienti\ufb01c journals. In\nsome cases essential items of information such as the\ntrial protocol and its subsequent amendments are simply\nnot\nincluded in journal articles or are replaced by\nmethods written post facto. In other cases of items essen-\ntial for the interpretations of the trial results (such as\nthe statistical analysis plan), tens of pages are reduced to\na paragraph on sample size calculation in the journal\nreport, underscoring the lack of detail (and its attendant\nproblems) common to public forms of trial reporting.\nFor example, the ratio of words in the protocol of the\nCSR for aripiprazole CN138135 to the methods section\nfor published journal article of the same trial is 30.5\n(53 713 words in the CSR protocol vs 1763 words in the\njournal article). For the oseltamivir WP16263 trial, the\nratio was 22.7 (26 761 words in the CSR protocol and\namendments vs 1177 words in the journal article).\n\nThis compression of information also occurs in databases\n\nnot restricted by length, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.40\n\nOur study raises the question of why the medical com-\nmunity has accepted the low (summary, aggregate) level\nof detail found in most peer-reviewed journal publica-\ntions compared with the depth of detail available in\nCSRs. European regulators recently noted: \u2018documents\nthat provide critical information on a study, such as the\nprotocol (16.1.1), statistical methods (16.1.9),\nlist of\ninvestigators and study sites and sample case report\nforms, would always be needed by reviewers assessing a\nstudy.\u201941 Why have those outside of the regulatory world\ntolerated journal publications lacking such details?\n\nindustry,\n\nOne possibility may be that while the clinical trial\nenterprise has changed dramatically in the last half\ncentury, the scienti\ufb01c journal publication model has not.\nSince the 1950s, there have been considerable transfor-\nmations in the political economy of clinical trials driven\nby the increasingly commercialised and global nature of\nthe pharmaceutical\nthe rise in academic-\nindustry \u2018partnerships\u2019 in medicine and increased com-\nmunication among regulators. It is now common to \ufb01nd\ntrials with study centres scattered around the globe. This\nincreasing complexity and the need to provide an audit\nrecord is re\ufb02ected in the comprehensive tomes docu-\nmenting the trials\u2014CSRs\u2014but trial reporting in scien-\nti\ufb01c journals remains limited to summary and aggregate\ndetails. It should be noted, however, that many journals\nnow have websites which enable them to make available\nextended content beyond what traditionally appears in\nthe printed journal.\n\nAuthorship or contributorship?\nExamination of CSRs revealed scores of important tech-\nnical contributions to the design, conduct and reporting\nof each trial. These included contributions from data-\nbase programmers, records of\ufb01cers and CSR writers,\noften invisible in the published journal article.
