The first part of the study consisted of \na 2-week no-treatment Screening period and a 12-week DB treatment phase that required a \ntotal of 5 visits: Screening visit, Randomization/Baseline visit, Week 4 visit, Week 8 visit, \nand an end of DB treatment visit at Week 12.  The second part of the study consisted of a \n12-week OL treatment phase that required a total of 3 visits (Week 16, Week 20, and an end \nof treatment visit at Week 24) and a follow-up telephone call at Week 26. \n\nDuring the Screening period any current pharmacological treatments for OAB were to be \nstopped, and the subjects were to complete 3-day micturition diaries prior to the Baseline \nvisit.  In the 12-week DB treatment phase, enrolled subjects who met all entry criteria were \neligible to be randomized to receive fesoterodine SR 4 mg or equivalent placebo once daily \n(QD), and were randomized to receive instructions to take the study medication either in the \nevening or in the morning.  The randomization was stratified by age (>75 years, \u226475 years) \nso that there was a 1:1 ratio for fesoterodine to placebo within each stratum. \n\nThe DB treatment phase was followed by a 12-week OL phase to ensure all eligible subjects \nreceived fesoterodine SR treatment.  At the Week 24 visit, all subjects ended their treatment; \nall subjects were then to be followed up by telephone at Week 26.  Throughout the 24-week \nstudy, subjects were permitted only 1 dose increase to fesoterodine 8 mg.  Likewise, subjects \nwho increased their dose from 4 mg to 8 mg at any time during the 24-week study were \nallowed to decrease back to the 4 mg dose; that decrease was the final dose adjustment \nallowed. \n\nStudy procedures are detailed in Table 1. \n\nTemplate Version 1.0  \n\nPage 2 \n\n090177e18543a101\\Approved\\Approved On: 24-Apr-2014 16:59 \fPublic Disclosure Synopsis \nProtocol A0221045 \u2013 28 March 2014 \u2013 Final \n\nTable 1.

A total of 1045 subjects were screened of which 794 were \nassigned to study treatment (50 in Austria, 11 in Belgium, 25 in Denmark, 97 in Finland, \n64 in Germany, 25 in Israel, 29 in Italy, 65 in Norway, 65 in Portugal, 68 in Slovakia, 80 in \nSpain, 127 in Sweden, 15 in Switzerland, 14 in Turkey, and 59 in the UK): 398 subjects to \nfesoterodine and 396 subjects to placebo.  Of the 794 subjects randomized, 785 subjects \nreceived study treatment (fesoterodine [392] and placebo [393]).  All 785 treated subjects \nwere analyzed for safety; 756 subjects were included in the Full Analysis Set (FAS) for \nefficacy. \n\nDiagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion:  Male or female subjects \uf0b365 years old with \nOAB symptoms (subject-reported) for \uf0b33 months prior to Screening visit according to \nInternational Continence Society guidelines, mean urinary frequency of \uf0b38 micturitions per \n24 hours as verified by the micturition diary prior to Randomization/Baseline visit, and mean \nnumber of urgency episodes per 24 hours as verified by the Screening micturition diary prior \nto Baseline (urgency episodes were defined as those with Urinary Sensation Scale [USS] \nrating \uf0b33). \n\nStudy Treatment:  Fesoterodine SR was supplied as white 4 mg or 8 mg tablets dispensed \nfrom a blister pack.  Placebo was provided as tablets with the same appearance as the \nfesoterodine SR tablets. \n\nIn the 12-week DB treatment phase, randomized subjects were started on a dose of \nfesoterodine SR 4 mg or equivalent placebo QD.  After 4 weeks of treatment (at the Week 4 \nvisit), subjects were permitted a one-time dose increase to 8 mg, if needed, in order to further \noptimize their treatment.  If they remained on the 4 mg dose after 4 weeks of treatment, they \nwere permitted to increase their dose to 8 mg after 8 weeks of treatment (at the Week 8 visit) \nif necessary.  Any change in dose was to be made based on a clinical benefit vs tolerability \nassessment.  The DB treatment phase was followed by a 12-week OL phase to ensure all \neligible subjects received fesoterodine SR treatment.  Subjects who received fesoterodine SR \nin the DB phase were to be maintained on the same dose during the OL phase.  Subjects who \nreceived placebo during the DB phase were started on fesoterodine SR 4 mg with the option \nto increase their dose to 8 mg at the Week 16 or Week 20 visit.  Throughout the 24-week \nstudy, subjects were permitted only 1 dose increase to fesoterodine 8 mg (and 1 decrease \nfrom 8 mg back to 4 mg, if necessary). \n\nSubjects were instructed to swallow, without chewing, their 1 tablet of study drug with water \nQD with or without food.  During the DB phase, subjects took study drug in the evening \n(within 4 hours of bedtime) or in the morning (within 2 hours of rising) according to \nrandomization.  During the OL phase, subjects were given the choice to take their study \nmedication in the evening or in the morning. \n\nTemplate Version 1.0  \n\nPage 5 \n\n090177e18543a101\\Approved\\Approved On: 24-Apr-2014 16:59 \fPublic Disclosure Synopsis \nProtocol A0221045 \u2013 28 March 2014 \u2013 Final \n\nEfficacy Endpoints: \n\nPrimary Endpoint: \n\n\uf0b7  Numeric change of micturition-related urgency episodes per 24 hours at Week 12 relative \nto Baseline (micturition-related urgency episodes were defined as those with USS rating \nof \uf0b33 marked for the corresponding micturition in the diary). \n\nSecondary Endpoints: \n\nMicturition Diary \n\n\uf0b7  Percent change of micturition-related urgency episodes per 24 hours at Weeks 4, 8, \n\nand 12 relative to Baseline. \n\n\uf0b7  Change in mean number of severe micturition-related urgency episodes per 24 hours at \nWeeks 4, 8, and 12 relative to Baseline (severe urgency episodes were defined as those \nwith the USS rating \uf0b34). \n\n\uf0b7  Percent change of severe micturition-related urgency episodes per 24 hours at \n\nWeeks 4, 8, and 12 relative to Baseline. \n\n\uf0b7  Change in mean number of micturitions per 24 hours at Weeks 4, 8 and 12 relative to \n\nbaseline (micturitions included episodes of voluntary micturition and episodes of urgency \nurinary incontinence (UUI). \n\n\uf0b7  Percent change of micturitions per 24 hours at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 relative to Baseline. \n\n\uf0b7  Change in mean number of night-time micturitions per 24 hours at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 \n\nrelative to Baseline. \n\n\uf0b7  Percent change of night-time micturitions per 24 hours at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 relative to \n\nBaseline. \n\n\uf0b7  Change in mean number of UUI episodes per 24 hours at Weeks 4, 8 and 12 relative to \nBaseline (UUI episodes were defined as those with the USS rating of 5 in the diary). \n\n\uf0b7  Percent change of UUI episodes per 24 hours at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 relative to Baseline. \n\n\uf0b7  Change in the daily sum rating in the USS at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 relative to Baseline. \n\n\uf0b7  The percentage of subjects who were incontinent at Baseline (at least 1 UUI episode \nduring the baseline period) and were dry (no UUI episodes) in the 3 days prior to \nWeeks 4, 8, 12 and 24. \n\n\uf0b7  Change in number of urinary incontinence pads, barrier creams and powder (for skin \n\nprotection) used by subjects with UUI. \n\nTemplate Version 1.0  \n\nPage 6 \n\n090177e18543a101\\Approved\\Approved On: 24-Apr-2014 16:59 \fPublic Disclosure Synopsis \nProtocol A0221045 \u2013 28 March 2014 \u2013 Final \n\nAll micturition diary related endpoints were also calculated at Week 24 for the OL phase \nanalyses.

Laboratory safety tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical examinations \nwere performed at Screening only. \n\nStatistical Methods:  The datasets analyzed included: \n\n\uf0b7  FAS: consisted of all subjects who were randomized and took at least 1 dose of DB \n\ntreatment and provided baseline and post-baseline efficacy data for at least 1 endpoint \nand at least 1 time point during the DB phase. \n\n\uf0b7  Full Analysis OL Set: all subjects who took at least 1 dose of study medication and \nprovided at least 1 post DB phase efficacy measurement during the OLphase of the \nstudy. \n\n\uf0b7  Per Protocol (PP) Analysis Set: consisted of all subjects in the FAS who completed \n\nthe DB treatment phase and did not deviate from or violate the protocol in such a way \nthat could affect efficacy outcome. \n\n\uf0b7  Safety Analysis Set: consisted of all subjects who took at least 1 dose of study \n\nmedication during the DB phase. \n\n\uf0b7  Safety OL Analysis Set: consisted of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of the \n\nstudy treatment during the OL phase of the study. \n\nAnalysis of Primary Endpoint: The primary analysis for the primary endpoint was based on \nthe FAS.  An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was used to compare fesoterodine \n(4 mg and 8 mg pooled) against placebo.  The primary model included terms for treatment, \ndosing time, age category, and study center as fixed factors and baseline value as a \ncontinuous covariate.  Least squares (LS) means for each treatment group and associated \nstandard errors were derived.  Differences in LS means were calculated and associated \n2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and p-values were provided.  Summary statistics \n(N, mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviations) were also provided for \nBaseline and Week 12, along with the change from Baseline to Week 12 for each treatment \ngroup.  If the assumptions of any of the planned analyses were not met, then alternative \nappropriate statistical techniques were to be used. \n\nAnalysis of Secondary Endpoints During the DB Phase: All analyses compared fesoterodine \n(doses of 4 and 8 mg pooled) vs placebo.  Numeric changes in frequencies for diary-derived \nendpoints were summarized and analyzed using ANCOVA in a similar way to the analysis of \nthe primary endpoint.  Those endpoints based on percentage changes were summarized \nsimilarly to the primary endpoint and analyzed using non-parametric methods.  Binary data \nwere analyzed using logistic regression models for endpoints based on diary data and \nquestionnaires during the DB phase.  The model included terms for study center, treatment \ngroup, dosing time, and age category.  Odds ratios (using placebo as the reference group), \ncorresponding 95% CIs, and p-values were presented along with the summary statistics.  \nThese analyses were also supported by simple summaries (number and percentage) at each \nvisit without covariate adjustment as for categorical data.

Frequency tables (counts and \npercentages) were presented for each treatment group.  The Van Elteren Test was used to \ncompare the continuous efficacy endpoints between the treatment groups based on \npercentage changes derived from the diary data.  The stratification variable was a 4-level \nindicator (morning dosing, \u226475 years; morning dosing, >75 years; evening dosing, \u226475 years; \nevening dosing, >75 years).  Summary statistics were provided for Baseline and Weeks 4, 8, \nand 12 for each treatment group.  These summary statistics were also provided for numeric \nand percentage changes from Baseline to Weeks 4, 8, and 12. \n\nThe PPBC and PPUS were analyzed using logistic regression (major improvement [yes/no] \nfrom Baseline and minor improvement [yes/no] from Baseline).  Frequency tables for \nBaseline and Weeks 4, 8, and 12 were presented for each treatment group.  The change from \nBaseline categories were also presented for Weeks 4, 8, and 12.  The PTBS was analyzed \nusing logistic regression.  Frequency tables (counts and percentages in each response \ncategory) for Week 12 were presented for each treatment group.  The OAB-q total score, \nsymptom bother score, and domains were summarized for Baseline and Weeks 4, 8, and 12 \nand the changes in total score, symptom bother score, and domains from Baseline were also \nsummarized and analyzed using ANCOVA.  The OAB-s items were analyzed using logistic \nregression (\u201csatisfied\u201d/\u201cnot satisfied\u201d for Questions 9, 10 and 11, and \u201cmeets or exceeds \nexpectations\u201d/\u201cdoes not meet expectations\u201d for Question 5).  Frequency tables were also \npresented for Week 12.  For subjects in the UK, the KHQ domains for Baseline and Week 12 \nand the changes in KHQ domains from Baseline to Week 12 were summarized, and the \nchanges were analyzed using ANCOVA.  The EQ-5D total score at Baseline and Week 12 \nand change from Baseline to Week 12 were summarized, and the change was analyzed using \nANCOVA. \n\nAnalysis of Endpoints at the end of the OL Phase:  The secondary endpoints (based on diary \ndata and questionnaires during the OL phase) were summarized as changes from Baseline to \nWeek 24 and as changes from Weeks 12 to 24. \n\nSafety data were summarized using descriptive statistics.

A larger proportion of \nsubjects in the DB placebo/OL fesoterodine group (3.5%) had AEs of dry mouth resulting in \ndose reduction or temporary discontinuation during the OL phase compared to the DB/OL \nfesoterodine group (0.6%). \n\nDeaths: There were 2 deaths reported (one each in DB fesoterodine group and DB placebo \ngroup).  One subject in the DB fesoterodine group, died approximately 2 weeks after ending \ntreatment.  The SAEs leading to death, all considered severe, were listed as abscess, \nappendicitis perforated, peritonitis, and sepsis; none was considered treatment-related. One \nsubject in the DB placebo group, died of metastatic colon cancer that had not been apparent \nat Screening approximately 6 weeks after ending treatment; the event was not considered \ntreatment-related. \n\nThere were no clinically meaningful changes from Baseline in vital signs during the DB or \nOL phases of the study. \n\nCONCLUSIONS: \n\n\uf0b7  Treatment of aged OAB subjects 65 years old and above with flexible-dose fesoterodine \n\n(4 mg or 8 mg QD) resulted in clinically relevant and statistically significant \nimprovements compared to placebo in the primary efficacy endpoint (changes from \nBaseline in the number of micturition-related urgency episodes per 24 hours) at Week 12 \n(end of the DB phase). \n\n\uf0b7  Treatment with flexible-dose fesoterodine (4 mg or 8 mg QD) resulted in clinically \nrelevant and statistically significant improvements compared to placebo in most \nsecondary diary and PRO endpoints in an elderly population at Week 12. \n\n\uf0b7  The additional efficacy achieved with fesoterodine treatment compared to placebo in the \nprimary endpoint and OAB-s items for the subgroups of subjects >75 years old (32% of \nthe overall population) and those \uf0a375 years old was comparable to the results seen in the \nelderly study population as a whole. \n\n\uf0b7  The additional efficacy achieved with fesoterodine treatment compared to placebo in \nbladder diary and PRO endpoints seen after 12 weeks of treatment was maintained \nthrough 24 weeks of treatment. \n\n\uf0b7  Subjects advancing from placebo (12 weeks of treatment in the DB phase) to fesoterodine \n(12 weeks of treatment in the OL phase) had efficacy results (for bladder diary and PRO \nendpoints) at Week 24 (end of the OL phase) that were similar to those achieved at Week \n24 by those receiving fesoterodine for 24 weeks during the DB and OL phases. \n\n\uf0b7  The overall AE and safety profiles were consistent with known effects of fesoterodine. \n\nTemplate Version 1.0  \n\nPage 33 \n\n090177e18543a101\\Approved\\Approved On: 24-Apr-2014 16:59 \fPublic Disclosure Synopsis \nProtocol A0221045 \u2013 28 March 2014 \u2013 Final \n\n\uf0b7  There were no new safety signals (including falls) in this medically complex elderly \n\npopulation. \n\n\uf0b7  Fesoterodine was generally well tolerated in elderly subjects with OAB syndrome for up \n\nto 24 weeks. \n\nTemplate Version 1.0  \n\nPage 34 \n\n090177e18543a101\\Approved\\Approved On: 24-Apr-2014 16:59 \f",
