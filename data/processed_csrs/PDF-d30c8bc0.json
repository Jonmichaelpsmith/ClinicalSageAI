The study provided pivotal \nefficacy data for pregabalin over an initial 12-week period that assessed the alleviation of \nRLS symptoms by study drug in these subjects.  In addition, pregabalin efficacy was \nevaluated by rate of efficacy augmentation, time to efficacy augmentation, and general \ntolerability and safety of pregabalin and pramipexole in subjects with moderate to severe \nidiopathic RLS over 52 weeks.\n\nActive treatments included fixed dose 300 mg/day pregabalin and 0.25 mg/day (or \n0.5 mg/day) pramipexole.  Each active treatment was administered over a 2-week escalation\nperiod for a total study duration of 52 weeks.  Subjects who were initially randomized to \nplacebo were redistributed to 1 of these active treatment arms after 12 weeks, and continued \nstudy treatment for the remaining 40 weeks.  At the end of the 52-week, double-blind \ntreatment period, there was a 1-week study drug taper-down period.

Of those assigned to study treatment, \n719 subjects received at least 1 dose.  There were 354 subjects who completed the study, and \n365 subjects discontinued.\n\nDiagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion:  Men or women at least 18 years of age, \ninclusive, with idiopathic RLS in the presence of all 4 RLS clinical manifestations, and \nhaving symptoms predominantly occurring in the evening were eligible to participate in the \nstudy.  Subjects had a history of RLS symptoms for at least 6 months and have an \nInternational Restless Leg Group Rating Scale (IRLS) total score \uf0b315 at beginning of \nplacebo run-in (1 week before Baseline) and end of placebo run-in (at Baseline).  Subjects \nhad RLS symptoms \uf0b315 nights during the month prior to Screening.  Subjects receiving RLS \ntherapy at Screening had RLS symptoms \uf0b315 nights per month prior to initiation of study \ntreatment, and had RLS symptoms \uf0b32 nights during the week of placebo run-in.  Subjects \nwith any secondary RLS were excluded or with RLS treatment augmentation at Screening.\n\nStudy Treatment:  Doses for active treatments were escalated to the assigned fixed dose \nduring the first 2 weeks of treatment.  Subjects assigned to placebo received a matching \nplacebo escalation scheme.  After Week 12, placebo subjects were redistributed to 1 of the \n3 active treatments and the dose was escalated in an identical manner to the assigned fixed \ndose over 2 weeks as described in Table 2.  Subjects continuing on active treatment received \ntheir active dose plus matching placebo capsules in a blinded fashion over this 2-week \nperiod.  At the end of the study (12 months), all the subjects, including those who \ndiscontinued from the study after being treated with study medication for at least 2 weeks or \nlonger but before the 12-month time point, were to be tapered off their study medication over \n1 week as described in Table 3.\n\nTable 2.\n\nPregabalin and Pramipexole Dose-Escalation Schedule\n\nTarget Dose\n\nPregabalin 300 mg/day\nPramipexole 0.5 mg/day\nPramipexole 0.25 mg/day\n\nDay 1-5\n(mg/Day)\n75\n0.125\n0.125\n\nDay 6-10\n(mg/Day)\n150\n0.25\n0.25\n\nDay 11 Onward\n(mg/Day)\n300\n0.50\n0.25\n\nTable 3.\n\nPregabalin and Pramipexole Dose-Tapering Schedule\n\nTarget Dose\n\nPregabalin 300 mg/day\nPramipexole 0.5 mg/day\nPramipexole 0.25 mg/day\n\nDay 1-3\n(mg/Day)\n150\n0.25\n0.125\n\nDay 4-6\n(mg/Day)\n75\n0.125\nPlacebo\n\nDay 7\n(mg/Day)\nPlacebo\nPlacebo\nPlacebo\n\nTemplate version 1.1\n\nPage 5\n\n090177e185945af4\\Approved\\Approved On: 04-Aug-2014 19:20 \fPublic Disclosure Synopsis\nProtocol A0081186 \u2013 18 July 2014 \u2013 Final\n\nEfficacy and Safety Endpoints:\n\nPrimary:  \n\n\uf0b7 Changes from Baseline in RLS symptom severity using the IRLS total score for \n\nefficacy assessment;\n\n\uf0b7 The proportion of subjects responding to treatment using the Clinical Global \n\nImpression\u2013Improvement (CGI-I) scale for efficacy assessment.

The death was not considered related to study \ntreatment.\n\nLaboratory Evaluations:  There were no clinically meaningful differences in laboratory \nvalues among treatment groups in the median changes from Baseline to the last observation.  \nThe percentages of subjects with maximum increases or decreases in vital sign data were \ngenerally similar between treatment groups, the percentage of subjects with a maximum \nincrease from Baseline in standing systolic blood pressure (BP) was slightly higher in the \npramipexole 0.25 mg and placebo to pramipexole 0.50 mg treatment groups, and the \npercentage of subjects with a maximum increase from Baseline in supine diastolic BP was \nhigher in the placebo to pregabalin 300 mg treatment group.  The percentages of subjects \nwho experienced maximum decreases from Baseline in supine and standing systolic BP and \ndiastolic BP were lower in the placebo to pramipexole 0.50 mg treatment group, compared to \nthe other treatment groups.\n\nAt Week 52, no significant changes in electrocardiogram were reported.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:  Pregabalin 300 mg/day demonstrated significant improvements in RLS \nsubjects in each of the 3 co-primary endpoints: the difference of change from Baseline in the \nIRLS total score (compared to placebo for 12 weeks and pramipexole 0.25 and 0.5 mg/day \nfor 12 and 52 weeks), CGI-I responder rates (compared to placebo over 12 weeks), and \nreduction in the rate of augmentation (compared to pramipexole 0.5 mg/day).  Pregabalin \n300 mg/day demonstrated lesser augmentation severity than both pramipexole 0.25 and \n0.5 mg/day.  Pregabalin 300 mg/day in this study population was shown to be safe, well \ntolerated, and consistent with the known safety profile of pregabalin.\n\nTemplate version 1.1\n\nPage 53\n\n090177e185945af4\\Approved\\Approved On: 04-Aug-2014 19:20 \f",
