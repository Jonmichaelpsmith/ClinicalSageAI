If the subject had pain in one or both lower limbs and back \npain then the PI-NRS score for the worst affected lower limb was used as the primary endpoint for that \nsubject, but the PI-NRS score for the back was also recorded and analysed separately as a secondary \nendpoint. \n\nPost Hoc Analyses \nPost hoc analyses were conducted on the primary endpoint and responder rates to explore the treatment \neffect in different subpopulations.   \nIn addition to the model described by the SAP (period level baseline), analyses of the primary endpoint \nand responder rates were also conducted using a mixed effects model that included both a period and \nsubject level (mean of baseline 1 & 2) baseline as fixed effects.   \n\nPharmacokinetics Analysis: \nThe PK analysis population consisted of 78 subjects (43 males, 35 females).  Each subject had 11 PK \nsamples taken, of which four at steady state on active treatment (two pre-dose and two 2 hrs post-dose).  \nThe total number of concentration records (on active treatment only) in the final datafile was 287.  The \nobservations were visually compared to the study specific (regimen and population) predictions (median \nand 90% prediction interval) from a historical popPK model based on healthy volunteer phase I data.  \nSubsequently, non-linear mixed effect modelling was used, applying the historical popPK model, to \nestimate the PK parameters for each individual.  For the final model all PK parameters were fixed to the \nhealthy volunteer values except for the between subject variability on CL/F.  The data did not allow other \nparameters to be estimated with sufficient confidence.  The final model described the observations well \nand neither obvious biases, nor evidence of non-compliance were observed.  The individual PK \nparameters were then used to derive (through simulation and calculation) the individual exposures at \nsteady state, assuming full compliance. \n\nSafety Analysis: \nThe safety population, defined as all subjects who had received any amount of study medication, was \nused for safety analyses.  Safety data was presented in tabular and/or graphical format and summarized \ndescriptively. \n\nSUMMARY: RESULTS \nEfficacy: \n\n\uf0b7  CNV1014802 significantly improved neuropathic pain in LSR patients.  On the primary \n\nendpoint, there was a difference in the average change in PI-NRS for neuropathic pain from \nbaseline to Week 3 of -0.43 (p= 0.0255) for CNV1014802 compared to placebo. \n\n\uf0b7  A statistically significant effect on neuropathic pain levels was seen from Week 2 onwards. \n\uf0b7  There were no statistically significant effects of CNV1014802 on PI-NRS assessments of lower \n\nback pain \u2013 non-neuropathic. \n\n\uf0b7  The effect of CNV1014802 on neuropathic pain was most pronounced in monotherapy patients.  \nThere was a difference in the average change in PI-NRS for neuropathic pain from baseline to \nWeek 3 of -0.73 (p= 0.0038) for CNV1014802 compared to placebo in monotherapy patients. \n\n\uf0b7  There was no evidence that patients with no prior surgery responded any differently to \n\nCNV1014802 than those with a history of surgery. \n\n\uf0b7  There were no statistically significant differences between CNV1014802 and placebo on any of \n\nthe other secondary efficacy endpoints as analysed using the period 1 baseline only. \n\n\uf0b7  Sensitivity analyses conducted analysing the first period only in a between subject analysis \n\nshowed a similar magnitude of effect of PI-NRS in Week 3 compared to baseline, in both the all \nsubject ITT population (-0.43, p= 0.1858) and the Monotherapy subjects (-0.81, p=0.0555). \n\nPharmacokinetics:  \n\n\uf0b7  CNV1014802 plasma concentrations and exposures were as expected from the healthy volunteer \n\nCONFIDENTIAL \n\nPage 7 of 95 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fCompany name: Convergence Pharmaceuticals Ltd \nStudy drug: CNV1014802  \n\nProtocol No.:1014802/201 \nCSR FINAL Revised, 04-September-2014 \n\n\uf0b7 \n\nPhase I PK data. \nIndividual PK exposures could be estimated in 78/79 subjects that received active treatment 350 \nBID. \n\n\uf0b7  The  median  (90%  percentile  range)  derived  exposures  were  AUC(0-24)-ss  55  (40  -  78) \n\n[\u03bcg*hr/ml], Cmax-ss 3.7 (2.7 - 5.0) [\u03bcg/ml], Cmin-ss 1.4 (0.9 - 2.0) [\u03bcg/ml]. \n\n\uf0b7  The PK data suggested no evidence of major non-compliance. \n\nSafety: \n\n\uf0b7  CNV1014802 was well tolerated; 58% subjects dosed with CNV1014802 reported TEAE\u201fs \n\ncompared to 49% dosed with placebo.  \n\n\uf0b7  The most common treatment emergent adverse events occurring in this study were headache \n\n(CNV1014802: 12 subjects (15.2%); placebo: 5 subjects (6.8%)) and dizziness (CNV1014802: 9 \nsubjects (11.4%); placebo: 3 subjects (4.1%)).  The majority of all TEAE\u201fs were mild in \nseverity. \n\n\uf0b7  A total of 8 (10.1%) CNV1014802 and 1 (1.4%) placebo treated subjects were discontinued due \nto TEAE\u201fs.  One CNV1014802 subject was discontinued due to a rash which was considered to \nbe related to study drug. \n\n\uf0b7  ALT increases of >3xULN were observed in two subjects dosed with CNV1014802.  One \n\nsubject was discontinued from the study; this subject also had significant elevations of AST, \nGGT and alkaline phosphatase.  Serum bilirubin was normal in both subjects.  The abnormal \nlaboratory parameters in both subjects rapidly fell once CNV1014802 was withdrawn. \n\n\uf0b7  No other clinically significant changes in laboratory test parameters, were reported. \n\uf0b7  There were no clinically significant changes in BP, heart rate or ECG parameters associated \n\nwith CNV1014802 \n\nSUMMARY: CONCLUSION \nThe primary objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of repeat oral dosing of CNV1014802 \non neuropathic pain in subjects with lumbosacral radiculopathy.  There was a small but statistically \nsignificant effect of CNV1014802 compared to placebo at Week 3 on the change in neuropathic pain \nassociated with LSR, but not with low back pain.  The improvement in the monotherapy subset was \ngreater than in the overall ITT population.  No significant changes in the secondary endpoints were \nobserved.  Whilst improvements in pain ratings were seen, there were no statistically significant \ndifferences between CNV1014802 and placebo on any of the other secondary efficacy endpoints.  \nHowever, these were analysed using the period 1 baseline only for both treatment periods baseline.  \nCNV1014802 plasma concentrations and exposures were as expected from phase I healthy volunteer data \nand there was no evidence of major non-compliance. \n\nCNV1014802 was generally well tolerated with the most common adverse events being headache and \ndizziness.  No serious adverse events were reported and only 2 subjects experienced severe treatment \nemergent adverse events (headache and liver function test abnormal) which both resolved without \nsequelae.  Two subjects treated with CNV1014802 reported rises in ALT greater than 3x ULN which fell \nrapidly once CNV1014802 was terminated.  One subject was discontinued with a rash which was related \nto CNV1014802.  No other clinically significant changes in laboratory test parameters, vital signs or \nECG changes were reported. \n\nDate of Report: 04 September 2014 \n\nCONFIDENTIAL \n\nPage 8 of 95 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f",
