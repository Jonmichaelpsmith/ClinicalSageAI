          "detailedDescription": "OBJECTIVES:\n\n* Determine the efficacy and safety of sargramostim (GM-CSF) by cytogenetic examination of the bone marrow in patients with chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia who are not in complete cytogenetic remission after initial therapy.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously daily for 3 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving no response receive GM-CSF for an additional 3 months. Patients failing to achieve a partial response or better after the second course of GM-CSF are removed from the study. Patients achieving a partial response after the first or second course of GM-CSF continue to receive GM-CSF for an additional 9 months. Patients are then re-evaluated. Patients achieving a complete cytologic response at 9 months then receive GM-CSF 3 times weekly in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nPatients are followed every 2 weeks.\n\nPROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."

The biomarkers of exposure will be measured in blood and urine samples collected from the subjects. Moreover, the biomarkers in subjects smoking conventional or SMAR cigarettes will be compared with those biomarkers in smokers who stop smoking for 5 days. The short term safety of this new product will also be evaluated.",

Subjects will be discharged in the morning of D6. From the discharge of the subject, a 7-day safety follow-up period will be carried out (until D13)."

          "briefSummary": "Suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts, and suicide are increasingly common in adolescence.\n\nCurrent face-to-face prevention approaches are of limited effectiveness, rely on extensive resources, and are at odds with adolescents' digital preferences. We will evaluate two unconventional but promising interventions delivered to 13- to 17-year-olds: transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation to target emotion dysregulation, and a peer-support smartphone app to combat social isolation. If effective, these digitally-delivered interventions could reach far more adolescents at far lower cost than current approaches.",
          "detailedDescription": "Over the past two decades, suicide rates have increased nearly 35% in the U.S., with upward trends in nearly all demographic groups. Further increases have occurred since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Despite ambitious goals for reducing suicides and significant federal and private investment, suicide rates continue to rise unabated. To date, the predominant approach to mitigating suicide risk in the U.S. is secondary prevention. Typically, these programs identify risk of recurrence among those who have already attempted suicide at least once. Although secondary prevention is crucial, the majority of deaths by suicide occur on first attempt. Thus, targeted primary prevention earlier in development is essential. Most current primary prevention programs are intensive, expensive, and delivered by highly trained mental health providers, who are in short supply. Traditional face-to-face therapy is also unavailable to many who live in underserved communities, and disliked by adolescents, who much prefer digital delivery on their devices. This high-risk, high-reward proposal addresses these limitations and needs. We use an experimental therapeutics approach to evaluate the independent and combined efficacies of two unconventional but scalable interventions: transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) to target emotion dysregulation, and a peer-support smartphone app to combat social isolation. These low-cost interventions, which hold strong promise but have not been used before, can reach large numbers of adolescents, with much potential to reduce prospective suicide risk. We will enroll 212 adolescents, ages 13-17 years, who show elevations on at least two prominent risk factors for suicide (e.g., self-injury, maltreatment).\n\nUsing a 2 \u00d7 2 design, adolescents will be assigned randomly to receive 30 days of treatment with:\n\n1. tVNS to target emotion dysregulation,\n2. a peer-support phone app to target social isolation,\n3. tVNS + a peer-support phone app, or\n4. enhanced treatment as usual with monitoring and access to resources.\n\nIntervention effects on mechanisms (emotion dysregulation, social isolation) proximal efficacy signals (e.g., physiological reactivity, self-harm) and target outcomes (suicidal ideation, suicidal behaviors) will be evaluated immediately post-intervention and at one-year follow-up. Treatment data will be monitored daily to fine-tune dosing of both interventions. This transformative and innovative proposal tests two novel, scalable preventive interventions designed to \"meet adolescents where they are\" by using digital technologies to address core mechanisms of suicide risk."

This has been explained by its association with ventilator induced lung injury. Since then, a protective lung ventilation strategy has been very important, with a low tidal volume of 4-6 ml/kg. Patients undergoing surgery will inevitably require mechanical ventilation. In particular, patients undergoing one lung ventilation for thoracic surgery may have increased airway pressure and a greater chance of ventilator induced lung injury. Recently, protective lung ventilation has been applied to patients undergoing one ung ventilation during thoracic surgery. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the difference in the degree of pulmonary oxygenation and the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications in hypercapnia induced by controlling the respiratory rate with a constant tidal volume."

Determine whether genistein treatment will decrease the number of circulating prostate cells (CPCs) in the peripheral blood as measured by qRT-PCR for PSA performed on RNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the natural history of circulating prostate cells (CPCs) in a cohort of subjects prior to and post radical prostatectomy.\n\nII. Compare the measurement of PSA between three separate methods: in CPCs by qRT-PCR, in serum by the standard clinical chemistry assay (i.e., ELISA), and in plasma and serum by the nano-PSA assay.\n\nIII. Measure the effect of genistein on gene and protein expression in prostate tissue by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively, for the following genes and their respective protein products: HSP27, MMP-2, ALK-2, BASP1, and HCF2.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive oral genistein once daily for 3 months beginning at least 1 month prior to radical prostatectomy.\n\nARM II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily for 3 months beginning at least 1 month prior to radical prostatectomy.\n\nAll patients undergo radical prostatectomy at least 2 weeks, but not more than 3 months following the start of therapy.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1, 6, and 12 months."

Aim of the Study: To detect the optimal analgesic and safe caudal adjuvant DEXM dose associated with the least side effects\\& stress response modulation, guided by PO Cortisol peak difference in between the study groups during pediatric hypospadias surgery.\n\nOptimal effective dose defined as; the least caudal DEXM dose which produce the best analgesic outcome \\[least time to 1st analgesic request and lowest rescue analgesic dose (24Hs)\\] associated with the least stress response (cortisol PO. first One hour peak), least PO sedation, and hemodynamic stability IO. \\&PO. HR \\& MAP. The peak cortisol level during urology surgery was at the end of the 1st postoperative (PO) hour.\n\n. Material \\& Methods A prospective randomized double blinded (drug injector and PO assessor) comparative study will be conducted in Mansoura university hospital after obtaining ethics committee approval and written informed parental consent 164 boys (age 1-6 years, ASA I) scheduled for hypospadias surgery. Exclusion criteria; (Operative time exceeding 3 hours, bodyweight \\>25kg, bleeding diathesis, infection at the site of block, pre-existing neurological or spinal disease or abnormalities of the sacrum, inability to palpate the sacral hiatus by anatomic landmark palpation technique) or those with a history of allergic reactions to local anesthetics were excluded from the study. Patients will fast for solids 6h and water and 2 hours before surgery. After Patient Preoperative preparation, General anesthesia induction, caudal block and caudal drug injection (Levob plus DEXM) bolus will be injected according to each group as follow;\n\n* Group A will take Caudal Levob 0. 125%+ DEXM 0.5\u00b5g/kg.\n* Group B will take Caudal Levob 0.125%+ DEXM 1\u00b5g/kg.\n* Group C will take Caudal Levob 0. 125%+ DEXM 1.5 \u00b5g/kg.\n* Group D will take Caudal Levob 0. 125%+ DEXM 2\u00b5g/kg.\n\nThe study outcomes recording:\n\n1ry outcome: Time to (1st analgesic request OPS \\>4).
