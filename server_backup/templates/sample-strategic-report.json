    "overview": "This strategic intelligence report analyzes the proposed Phase 3 trial for a novel GLP-1 receptor agonist in Type 2 Diabetes. The analysis is based on 23 historical trials with similar design characteristics and indication. The report provides evidence-based recommendations to optimize trial design, endpoint selection, and operational considerations to maximize probability of success.",
    "keyFindings": [
      "The average sample size for comparable Phase 3 diabetes trials is 756 patients, with a range of 450-1200 patients",
      "Historical success rate for GLP-1 receptor agonist trials in Type 2 Diabetes is approximately 78%",
      "The most commonly used primary endpoint is HbA1c reduction at 26 weeks (used in 87% of successful trials)",
      "Average trial duration is 26 weeks with extended follow-up safety assessments for 52 weeks",
      "Most successful trials used 2:1 or 1:1 randomization with placebo or active comparator"

    "strategicRecommendations": [
      "Design with a minimum sample size of 800 patients to ensure adequate statistical power (>90%)",
      "Use HbA1c reduction at 26 weeks as the primary endpoint with 7-point SMBG profile as key secondary endpoint",
      "Include cardiovascular safety monitoring to address regulatory requirements",
      "Implement a robust strategy to minimize dropouts, targeting <15% attrition rate",
