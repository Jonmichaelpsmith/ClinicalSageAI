Navigating the clinical 
study report (CSR): A road 
map to the data 
abstraction of CSRs for 
systematic reviews
Facilitators: Nicole Fusco, Roberta Scherer, 
Kay Dickersin

Purpose and Structure of 
this Workshop
•Introduction to Clinical Study Reports (CSRs) 
and their use in systematic reviews (10 
minutes)
•Small group scavenger hunt using excerpts 
from CSRs (30 minutes)
•Discussion of findings from scavenger hunt (30 
minutes)
•Lessons learned from our experiences (10 
minutes)
•Evaluation (10 minutes)

What is a clinical study 
report (CSR)?
“integrated full report of an individual study 
of any therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic 
agent (referred to herein as drug or treatment) 
conducted in patients, in which the clinical 
and statistical description, presentations, and 
analyses are integrated into a single report”

Example of a CSR:

s/#id=llgw0217
31. ICH 1995

What information is in a CSR?
•Study design
•Risk of bias
•Analysis methods
•Results for all outcomes
•All adverse events
•Case report forms
•Individual patient data

Individual patient data in CSRs
•Not always available
•Can be extracted into usable 
format using optical character 
recognition software

Benefits of using CSRs in 
meta-analysis
•Access to unpublished results
ØWhole outcomes (e.g., quality of life)
ØSubgroups (e.g., sex, comorbid conditions)
ØAdverse events
•Standardization of analysis methods
ØPopulation of analysis
ØMethods for handling missing data
8

Challenges of using CSRs
•Hard to obtain
•Extremely long
ØOur 8 CSRs: average length 2917 
pages, range 1315-8027
•Contradicting information
9

Case example: Tamiflu
2, 3
•Meta-analysis in 2003 showed:
ØReduced secondary complications 
and hospital admission
•FDA had different conclusions:
ØTamiflu did not reduce complications
•Cochrane review of CSRs

Gains from using CSRs
2, 3
11
•Access to trials with delayed or no 
publication
•Fine details of trial conduct
•Subgroup analysis
•Information about adverse events
•Ability to assess of validity of other 
data sources

Small groups
•Form groups of 2-3
•Each group will extract data from a CSR 
section
•Each group will have different sections of the 
CSR
•We will compare groups’ findings and discuss 
the benefits and challenges of using CSRs for 
systematic reviews
14

Data Extraction Item 1
What population(s) (e.g., intent-
to-treat, all randomized, 
evaluable, etc.) will be used for 
the efficacy analyses and how 
are these populations defined?
15

Data Extraction Item 2
Which outcomes are identified 
as "secondary” outcomes?
16

Data Extraction Item 3
The primary outcome was change 
from baseline in the Montgomery-
AsbergDepression Rating Scale 
(MADRS) at the end of the study 
(day 57). What data would you 
extract for meta-analysis of this 
outcome?
17

Follow-up Discussion
•What was difficult?
•What was unexpected?
18

Lessons Learned
•If the CSR is in PDF format, make sure 
the text is searchable
•Utilize the “Add note to text” function 
19

Example

Lessons Learned
•If the CSR is a PDF, make sure the text is 
searchable
•Utilize the “Add note to text” function
•Make a priori rules about which sections you 
will “trust” when there are discrepancies 
•Completely specify outcome
ØComparing outcomes in CSRs with 
outcomes in other sources can help identify 
potential for reporting bias
21

Wrap-Up
•Remaining questions
•Possible solutions to problems 
that arise
