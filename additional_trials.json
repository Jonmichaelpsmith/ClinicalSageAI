We have previously shown that \\[68Ga\\]FAPI Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET/CT) imaging shows potential for diagnosis and molecular understanding of this syndrome. We have previously shown that fibroblast activation protein (FAP) can be imaged in the lung, muscle and nasopharynx of long COVID patients (with dyspnea and fatigue). However, these preliminary data are derived from a selective group of patients with long COVID after critical COVID-19. We aim to explore the generalizability of these findings in patients with long COVID with dyspnea and fatigue, irrespective of the severity of their acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nPrimary objective: To assess if pulmonary fibroblast activity, measured by \\[68Ga\\]FAPI-46 PET/CT, is higher in patients with current long COVID dyspnea and fatigue compared to patients with resolved complaints.\n\nStudy design: This is a ZonMw funded single centre prospective observational cohort study of long COVID-19 patients with dyspnea and fatigue.\n\nStudy population: We will recruit 60 adult long COVID patients (aged \\>20 years) of which 30 have complaints of dyspnea and fatigue and compare them to 30 patients with resolved complaints and healthy controls.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is FAP expression in the lung measured by \\[68Ga\\]FAPI-46 PET/CT. Secondary endpoints are the expression of FAP in other tissues (muscle) and the relation between FAP and inflammation and remodelling biomarkers in various biological samples (e.g. serum/nasal epithelium).\n\nStudy procedures: In a single visit day the following data and samples will be collected: questionnaires, a lung function test, 6-minute walking test, blood samples, nose swabs, \\[68Ga\\]FAPI PET/CT scan and HRCT scan.

Although the incidence of difficult airways is commonly higher in critically ill patients, the evidence of severe hypoxemia without sign of respiratory distress could complicate the scenario.This silent hypoxia often leads to a delayed recognition of the severity of respiratory failure and to a late intubation which is often characterized by a high risk of complications related to the actual airways' management, hemodynamic and cardiac. It has been shown that non-survivors had worse blood gas analyzes than survivors, both before and after intubation. Few studies have reported the implications and adverse events of performing endotracheal intubation for critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs).",

All required study visits for this protocol may be conducted remotely; in-person visits at the NIH are optional. Subjects who have not yet been vaccinated will undergo baseline blood sampling using finger stick microsampler kits and/or venous blood draw within 7 days prior to receiving the vaccine. Additional samples will be requested from participants approximately 14-21 days after dose 1 and 21-28 days after dose 2 (if applicable). Optional samples may be collected at 6, 12, and 24 months post-vaccination. If subsequent booster doses are received while a participant is still on study, blood samples will again be requested approximately 28 days after each booster dose, through the 5th COVID-19 vaccine dose received, and then participants may proceed with the optional 6-, 12-, and 24-month follow-up sample collection. Participants who are able to attend in-person visits at NIH will have optional on-site blood draws 1 and 3 days after doses 1 and 2 (as applicable). Research evaluations will include baseline severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody titers to the spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), and receptor binding domain (RBD) proteins, to assess pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 exposure and evaluate responses to vaccination. Additional immune markers of interest may include presence of autoantibodies, transcriptomic profiling, T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, among others. Participants who only submit finger stick home microsampler kits at the timepoints listed above will be evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and autoantibodies only.

Additionally, we would like to evaluate the incidence of seroconversion in this high-risk population and to identify possible candidates for convalescent plasma donation for therapy/prophylaxis.",
      "detailedDescription": "The success of Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong in limiting the impact of the sudden acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), also know as COVID-19, has been attributed to their preparedness but mostly to the implementation and distribution of SARS-CoV-2 fast diagnostic tests and establishment of decentralized point-of-care (POC) testing (https://www.nature.com/articles/d41587-020-00010-2). So far, the frontline response to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has been polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. PCR is the gold standard for diagnosing an infectious agent, and it has the advantage that the primers needed for such tests can be produced with relative speed as soon as the viral sequence is known.\n\nThe first quantitative reverse-transcriptase-based PCR (RT-PCR) tests for detecting SARS-CoV2 were designed and distributed in January by the World Health Organization (WHO), soon after the virus was identified. The test protocol is complex and expensive, however, and is mainly suited to large, centralized diagnostic laboratories. Tests typically take 4-6 hours to complete, but the logistical requirement to ship clinical samples means the turnaround time is 24 hours at best. A new fast PCR test (45 min) from Cepheid has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on March 21st with availability at the end of the month. Rapid POC tests are also needed to accelerate clinical decision-making and to take some of the workload off centralized test laboratories. Most importantly, the current state of the matter in Indiana University Health system, as well as many around the country is that healthcare workers including from the ER and ICU are currently unable to receive adequate testing through existing facilities. Worst, their access to appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) has been limited, increasing their exposure risk and causing a significant amount of stress and anxiety for front-line healthcare providers across the country.\n\nBack to the Singapore experience, they have used immunoassays that can provide historic information about viral exposure, as well as diagnostic evidence. They exploited antibody-antigen recognition, either by using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to detect viral antigens in clinical samples or by using cloned viral antigens to detect patient antibodies directed against the virus. The lateral flow assay format - essentially a dipstick encased in a cassette - contains the capture reagents (either an mAb directed at a viral antigen or a viral antigen that is recognized by patients' antibodies) immobilized at defined locations on a nitrocellulose membrane, as well as labelled detector mAbs that recognize the same target. A positive result, which is triggered by binding between the analyte and capture mAb and binding by the detector mAb, is visible as a colored line. Two drops of blood from a pinprick is enough to detect a virus. They're essentially the same as home pregnancy kits. Several of these assays are available in Asia, and most European Countries have been using them too. In US, RayBiotech has developed such a similar test using knowledge from the Asian tests (https://www.raybiotech.com/covid-19-igm-igg-rapid-test-kit/). This product is CE marked and certified for diagnostic use in the EU. The application for FDA Emergency Use Authorizations of tests was submitted on March 16th, 2020. At the moment, the FDA has only approved PCR testing. No lateral flow tests have been approved as of March 23rd, 2020. However, this lateral flow test can be used legally in the US, for in vitro diagnostic use, as a POC test when administered by a licensed medical practitioner. These kits were developed in-house by Ray Biotech and validated using samples taken in hospital from patients showing clinical symptoms in Guangzhou China (all confirmed via PCR). Current stocks of 10,000 kits are being replenished daily at RayBiotech, with efforts to increase production ten-fold within the next week. The CE certificate can be found here: https://www.raybiotech.com/files/images/CG-COV_CE-Certificates.jpg.\n\nBased on the Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong positive experience, and to curb the fast spread of the virus in the US, we propose to use the POC SARS-CoV-2 IgG Antibody in high risk healthcare workers with or without symptoms, previously quarantine or not. Indeed, we hypothesize that the incidence of seroconversion among ER and ICU healthcare workers is high and higher than current models predict and that several cases are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms.\n\nThere are two additional benefits of testing seroconversion.\n\n1. Although there are no official reports, we clearly hear and see selfies of anxiety, stress and exhaustion from our colleagues at the front line. Thus for the healthcare workers knowing that they have seroconverted, will help them be more confident that they are now protected and can work in safer conditions as it has recently been shown that reinfection could not occur in SARS-CoV-2 infected rhesus macaques https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.13.990226v1.\n2. The healthcare workers represent an ideal pool of donors for convalescent plasma due to their commitment and the fact that they have usually been tested to give blood or are currently blood donors. The FDA just approved a master protocol for collection and administration of convalescent plasma: https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/investigational-new-drug-ind-or-device-exemption-ide-process-cber/investigational-covid-19-convalescent-plasma-emergency-inds\n\nIn sum, \"you cannot fight a fire blindfolded, and we cannot stop this pandemic if we don't know who is infected.\" (World Health Organization Director-General, 16 March 2020).\n\nIf successful and validated, we will hope to rapidly scale it up to propose the rapid SARS-CoV-2 IgG Antibody testing to the general population as has been done in countries that have had almost no death due to COVID-19.",

      "detailedDescription": "SARS -CORONA VIRUS -2 (COVID-19 disease) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus The virus enters the body through the nose, eyes, or mouth. The spike protein binds specifically to the ACE2 receptors present on the type 2 pneumocytes in the alveoli in the lungs . (Fehr and Perlman, 2015) The binding of the ACE2 receptor allows the entry of the virus into the host cell .\n\nThe virus enters the host cell either by direct cell entry by membrane fusion or by endocytosis .(Wang , et al. 2008).\n\nACE inhibitors (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors) work by preventing angiotensin I from converting into angiotensin II. (Byrd,et al. 2019)\n\nARBs (Angiotensin receptor blockers)reduce the action of the hormone angiotensin II, by blocking receptors that the hormone acts on, specifically AT1 receptors, which are found in the heart, blood vessels and kidneys. (Byrd,et al. 2019) ACE inhibitors and ARBs are used to treat high blood pressure and congestive heart failure, to prevent kidney failure in patients with high blood pressure or diabetes, and to reduce the risk of stroke. (Byrd,et al. 2019) Continued use of ACEI/ARB has become controversial in the setting of COVID-19. The reason for this controversy stems from the fact that ACEIs and ARBs use may increase the expression of ACE2 receptor in animal-based studies, which is the known cellular receptor and a necessary entry point for SARS-COV-2 infection, as it has been indicated that ACE2 expression is downregulated following SARS infection, resulting in excessive activation of RAS and exacerbated pneumonia progression.(Peng Zhang.et al.april2020) It has rather been suggested that despite increasing ACE2 levels, ACE inhibitors and ARBs may rather play a protective role. ACEI, by reducing the conversion of angiotensin I (ATI) to angiotensin II (ATII) and ARBs, by reducing the binding of ATII to angiotensin I receptor may tilt the scale suggested by Bombardini et al. in favour of a protective ACE2-signalling pathway .( Bombardini T, Picano E.2020).\n\nReynolds et.al (2020)found no association between ACE inhibitors and ARBs and increase likelihood of a positive test for covid- 19 or its severity. (Reynolds et.al (2020) However, due to lack of sufficient clinical data supporting either the beneficial or harmful effects of ACEI/ARBs use in patients with COVID-19, the optimal strategy for the management of hypertension in COVID-19 is uncertain and remains to be elucidated. So The aim of this observational study was to determine the association between hypertensive patients using ACEI/ARBs and morbidity and mortality of COVID-19.",

      "detailedDescription": "Systemic hyperinflammation is a hallmark of more severe stages of COVID-19 leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation and ultimately death. In this stage, COVID-19 is associated with a decrease in suppressor and regulatory T cell counts and an extensive release of proinflammatory cytokines and biomarkers called a cytokine storm, which is thought to be the major driver of severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2. C1 esterase inhibitor (C1INH) is a member of the serpin superfamily of serine-protease inhibitors and is a strong inhibitor of the complement System (CS) and the kinin-kallikrein (KK) System. Conestat alfa is a recombinant human C1INH, that shares an identical protein structure with plasma-derived C1INH. The rationale of the current trial is based upon the following assumptions: In the context of COVID-19, conestat alfa treatment may 1) dampen uncontrolled complement activation and collateral lung damage and 2) reduce capillary leakage and subsequent pulmonary edema by direct inhibition of KK system. The aim of this study is to analyze administration of conestat alfa for 72 hours in addition to standard of care in patients hospitalized with non-critical SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia (WHO Ordinal Scale Score 3 or 4) and its association with clinical severity on day 7 after inclusion and the risk of disease progression to Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).",

      "description": "This study is being conducted to assess the effectiveness of intermediate versus prophylactic doses of anticoagulation (blood thinners) in patients critically ill with COVID-19 in the intensive care units (ICUs) throughout the hospital. Anticoagulation is part of the patient's usual standard of care but determining the dose of anticoagulation is based on physician preference. The investigators are conducting this study (a randomized trial with adaptive design employing cluster randomization) with the support of all of the ICUs to collect data in order to determine what should be the standard of care in terms of anticoagulation in these critically ill patients. The patients care will not be altered other than the choice of anticoagulation (both approved and used throughout the hospital as standard of care) based on the ICU bed they are assigned. Patient data will be collected until discharge.",
      "detailedDescription": "Hemostatic, biomarker, and inflammatory changes are common in severe manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).Such factors, as well as the bedridden status and critical illness may constitute a prothrombotic milieu, predisposing to venous and arterial thrombosis. However, the optimal antithrombotic regimen for patients with COVID-19, especially those with severe disease, remains uncertain and is currently an area of active clinical interest. Prophylactic-dose anticoagulation is generally recommended for acutely ill hospitalized patients. However, given the hemostatic abnormalities of severe COVID-19 illness, it is unknown whether more intensive anticoagulation is preferred to reduce the risk of thrombotic events, potentially mitigating microvascular and macrovascular thrombi and even disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Further, the risks of therapeutic dose anticoagulation must be weighed against the bleeding risks inherent to this approach. To address this critical gap in knowledge in an area of clinical equipoise, the investigators plan to conduct a cluster-randomized trial in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) in a large volume academic medical center to select the best anticoagulation intervention.",

      "description": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in an ongoing global pandemic. It is unclear whether the relatively low number of reported cases of COVID-19 in people with CF (pwCF) is due to enhanced infection prevention practices or whether pwCF have protective genetic/immune factors. This study aims to prospectively assess the proportion of pwCF, including both adults and children with CF who have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies over a two-year period. This study will also examine whether pwCF who have antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 have a different clinical presentation and what impact this has on their CF disease. The proposed study will recruit pwCF from paediatric and adult CF centres throughout the United Kingdom. Serological testing to detect antibodies will be performed on blood samples taken at month 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24 with additional time-points if bloodwork is available via normal clinical care. Clinical data on, lung function, CF-related medical history, pulmonary exacerbations, antibiotic use, and microbiology and vaccination receipt, will be collected during routine clinical assessments.\n\nAssociations will be examined between socio-demographic and clinical variables and serologic testing. The effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on clinical outcomes and analyse end-points will be examined to explore any age-related or gender-based differences, as well as subgroup analysis of outcomes in lung-transplant recipients and pwCF receiving CFTR modulator therapies. As pwCF receive COVID-19 vaccination a comparison of the development and progression of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in pwCF following natural infection and vaccination SARS-CoV-2 over time will be performed.",
      "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study in people with Cystic Fibrosis (pwCF) that involves repeated serial sampling of participants. This study design was chosen to provide comprehensive information on SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence changes over time and the subsequent clinical impact on pwCF. The study will be conducted at participating CF centres over a 3-year period. Study participants will include paediatric and adult pwCF. For the UK section of the study, UK investigators in the European Cystic Fibrosis Society-Clinical Trials Network (ECFS-CTN) will be invited to participate. Participating investigators can enrol all eligible pwCF over a 12-month period. Participants are then followed up for 24 months. Participants will donate blood samples at their routine clinic visits. Blood samples will be collected at Day 0 (baseline), at Months 6, 12, 18 and 24 (to coincide with routine clinical reviews). Additional blood samples will be taken opportunistically every time the participant visits the clinic for blood draws. These blood samples could be related to, routine care, annual review visits, pulmonary exacerbations (PEx), CF complications or when initiating new treatments (e.g. CFTR modulators).\n\nSerum from blood samples will be shipped to a central laboratory (Queen's University Belfast) for standardized measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.\n\nAlongside the blood samples the investigators will also collect clinical data from the patient's health records and will input this data into the case report form (CRF). Clinical data will be collected in conjunction with routine care visits, according to local clinical practice. Investigators will collect data elements from information routinely recorded in the patients' medical records. Data will be collected at baseline, month 6, 12, 18 and 24 as per the study schedule, and at additional blood sampling timepoints as previously explained above. Data collection will include routine data available from CF clinic follow-ups including background demographic information, CF medical history, medications, exacerbation information, sputum microbiology and clinical and lung function parameters. Information on SARS-CoV-2 infection history and vaccine receipt will also be collected.\n\nThe maximum follow-up duration of participation in the study for each patient will be 24 months. This study duration (24-month follow-up) is justified as it provides sufficient time to observe changes in antibody prevalence over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as sufficient time to determine long term clinical outcomes for pwCF who are SARS-CoV-2 seropositive. Furthermore, we anticipate the 2-year study follow-up period will provide sufficient time to observe the impact of vaccination on antibody levels given that a number of vaccines are now commercially available.\n\nThe investigators will compare the level of antibody responses between natural COVID-19 infection and vaccination in pwCF and how this varies over time. This will be achieved by analyzing seroprevalence and antibody levels according to natural infection and vaccination status and according to time of sample post infection or post vaccination, if known.\n\nOptional Study sample collection:\n\nFor participants who consent, a second blood sample will also be drawn into EDTA tubes (plasma). Consent to this optional study sample would allow this sample and any remaining serum (following antibody testing) to be stored for future analysis and allow further research to be carried out on related studies to COVID-19 and CF.",
      "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n\u2022 Consenting people with cystic fibrosis of any age, genotype, transplant status and disease severity\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Refusal to give informed consent\n* Contraindication to venepuncture.\n\nParticipants already enrolled in a clinical trial are eligible for enrollment in this study. Inclusion in CAR-CF should not preclude enrollment in other observational clinical trial studies or clinical trials of an investigational medicinal product (CTIMP)."

      "description": "The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which originated in Wuhan, China, has become a major concern all over the world.\n\nConvalescent plasma or immunoglobulins have been used as a last resort to improve the survival rate of patients with SARS whose condition continued to deteriorate despite treatment with pulsed methylprednisolone. Moreover, several studies showed a shorter hospital stay and lower mortality in patients treated with convalescent plasma than those who were not treated with convalescent plasma. Evidence shows that convalescent plasma from patients who have recovered from viral infections can be used effectively as a treatment of patients with active disease.\n\nThe use of solutions enriched of antiviral antibodies has several important advantages over the convalescent plasma including the high level of neutralizing antibodies supplied. Moreover, plasma-exchange is expensive and requires large volumes of substitution fluid With either albumin or fresh frozen plasma, increasing the risk of cardiovascular instability in the plasma donor and in the recipient, which can be detrimental in a critically ill patient with COVID 19 pneumonia. The use of plasma as a substitution fluid further increases treatment costs and is associated with risk of infections, allergic reactions and citrate-induced hypocalcemia. Albumin is better tolerated and less expensive, but exchanges using albumin solutions increase the risk of bleeding because of progressive coagulation factor depletion.\n\nThe aforementioned limitations of plasma therapy can be in part overcome by using selective apheresis methods, such as double-filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP)3. During DFPP, plasma is separated from cellular components by a plasma filter, and is then allowed to pass through a fractionator filter. Depending on the membrane cut-off, the fractionator filter retains larger molecules and returns fluid along with smaller molecules to the circulation. Thus, the selection of a membrane with an appropriate sieving coefficient for IgG allows to efficiently clear autoantibodies in patients with antibody-mediated diseases (e.g., macroglobulinemia, myasthenia gravis and rheumatoid arthritis) with negligible fluid losses and limited removal of albumin and coagulation factors1.\n\nIn patients with severe membranous nephropathy and high titer of autoreactive, nephritogenic antibodies against the podocyte-expressed M type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R), DFPP accelerated anti PLA2R depletion4. Measurement of the antibody titer in treated patient and recovered fluid showed that antibody removal was extremely effective and that large part of antibodies was removed during the first DFPP procedure. This therapeutic regimen was safe and well tolerated and easy to apply4. In an ongoing pilot study we found that the same methodological approach can be used to remove circulating antibodies from patients who recovered from COVID 19 and to infuse these antibodies in patients with active viral infection. Treatment was well tolerated and preliminary findings are encouraging. Thus, in this novel pilot study we aim to explore whether the infusion of antibodies obtained with one single DFPP procedure from voluntary convalescent donors could offer an effective and safe therapeutic option for patients with earlier stages of coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia requiring oxygen supply without mechanical ventilation.",

Enisamium can directly inhibit influenza viral RNA replication and has antiviral effect against viruses, including coronaviruses (human coronavirus NL63, SARS-CoV-2).Based on the promising in-vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, it could be assumed that patients suffering from Covid-19 would benefit from a reduced virus load and this could lead to a reduction of Covid-19 typical symptoms that might prevent further complications associated with severe Covid-19 (e.g. active mechanical ventilation).\n\nAdult female and male patients, with Covid-19 infection, will be screened (Day 1) to participate in this trial. If all inclusion/exclusion criteria are fulfilled, randomization to treatment and a start of treatment will occur on Day 1.\n\nPatients will be randomized into 2 treatment groups (1:1) as follows: patients in treatment Group 1 will receive the active treatment with Amizon\u00ae Max capsule; patients in treatment Group 2 will receive a placebo capsule.

The surgical procedure in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection involves the exposure of other patients and the group of health workers who face the care of the patient. Thus, screening with lung ultrasound is an alternative to identify patients with an established or suspected infection that requires urgent surgery. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determinate the operational characteristics of lung ultrasound during the screening process for SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with an indication for urgent surgery.",
      "detailedDescription": "Surgical intervention of a COVID-19 patient involves the exposure of other patients and the group of health workers who face the care of the patient, which generates additional stress and a subsequent catastrophic respiratory and cardiovascular decompensation.\n\nManaging a patient who is going to undergo a surgical procedure as he was infected, makes health care workers and other patients aware from the risk of infection by reinforcing precautions measures. However, it implies the waste of personal protective elements, and a subsequent chance of consuming the limited stocks of those elements.\n\nLi, Y, et al., described transmission of COVID-19 in a thoracic surgery department. They were infected from a single patient, and from three-generation transmission eight more patients and eleven health care workers. 3 out of 9 patients were infected and none of the health care workers died.\n\nLei et al reported a case series of 34 patients undergoing surgical treatment during the incubation period of COVID-19. They all developed symptoms. 44% of the patients presented dyspnea in the following days and a third presented ARDS. Seven patients (21%) died.\n\nIn both reports it is clear that the failure to identify patients as COVID-19 infected patients prevented them from being managed with the proper precautions and preventive measures, and that health care workers did not use adequate personal protective elements. On the other hand, the reported outcome in both series was worse than the outcome in COVID-19 patients who did not required surgical treatment. This corresponds to anecdotal reports of cases in which manifestations occurred after surgery and did not have a favorable clinical course.\n\nIn addition to this, an exponential growth of the infection by the COVID-19 virus in Colombia and the large amount of unidentified contaminants, justifies the implementation of a system that allows the identification of patients with COVID-19 infection, with the purpose of a correct surgical management, isolation, and protection of health care workers and other patients.\n\nScreening with lung ultrasound is an alternative to identify patients with an established or suspected infection that requires urgent surgery. Its diagnostic efficacy has not been well studied in a systematic way in the scientific literature. Its use has just been described in patients with established COVID-19 pneumonia. Therefore, a research study is proposed to determine the operational characteristics of lung ultrasound during the screening process of patients who are going to be operated urgently.",

The local defence system, especially antibody-mediated immunity at the nasal epithelium, is crucial for COVID-19 prevention. However, people who responded to the vaccination against COVID-19 typically maintain sufficient local antibody levels in the nasal cavity for only a short period; hence a repeated boosting strategy is required to control the rate of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection.

      "description": "On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was formally notified about a cluster of cases of pneumonia in Wuhan City, China. On 7 January the responsible virus was isolated and its genome sequence was shared on 12 January. It was named as COVID-19, a novel Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. It is a member of the Corona virus family which is RNA enveloped viruses.\n\nVery rapidly the virus emerged as pandemic. Now it is dominating the lives of every people of this universe. Management of the COVID-19 relies on mainly supportive care and oxygen supplementation via non-invasive or mechanical ventilation in critical cases. Patients who are critically ill may also require vasopressor support and antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections.\n\nThere is no vaccine or highly effective antiviral drugs for COVID-19. Currently there is a tremendous effort around the world to develop effective preventive and therapeutic treatment for this disease.\n\nWorld Health Organization has launched a non-blinded clinical trial (SOLIDARITY) to evaluate four candidate treatments (remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir/ interferon beta-1a, and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine) versus standard of care in 18 countries worldwide. RECOVERY trial one of the largest trials to see the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine revealed that they are no clear cut clinical benefit for COVID-19. Other drugs in the SOLIDARTY trial are quite expansive for resource limited countries like Bangladesh.\n\nStudy Published in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine advocates further research into Ivermectin for COVID-19 Treatment. The spotlight on Ivermectin was brought by Australian researchers from Monash University who demonstrated its efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in vitro studies.\n\nIn different study Doxycycline also showed promising results in treatment of COVID 19 infection. It is highly lipophilic antibiotics that are known to chelate zinc component of matrix metalloprotienases (MMP). Corona viruses are known to rely heavily of MMPs for survival, cell infiltration and replication. It also has an anti-inflammatory effect which might be effective in combating cytokine storm of Covid-19 infection.\n\nSo it have been planned to conduct an experimental clinical trial using combination of ivermectin and doxycycline for treatment of COVID 19 along with the other standard care.",
      "detailedDescription": "OBJECTIVES:\n\nGeneral objectives:\n\nTo observe the benefit (clinical and microbiological) of Ivermectin and Doxycycline in Confirmed Covid 19 cases.\n\nSpecific objectives:\n\n1. To observe the clinical outcome in trial group and the placebo group.\n2. To observe the duration require controlling viral replication (negative RT-PCR) in the trial and placebo group.\n3. To compare the outcome between the two groups.\n\nRATIONALE:\n\nCovid-19 is an emergent pandemic, threatens the life of millions of the people throughout the globe. There is increasing effort of the scientist to unveil a remedy of covid-19. Still it is unsuccessful. At present there is no other alternative other than experimenting the existent drug against the virus. There are several trials going throughout the globe. Among them Ivermectin showed good efficacy in vitro trial. Some clinical trial also proved it beneficial. The Doxycycline also has some anti viral role with its prominent anti-inflammatory role. Synergistic action of the two drugs might be proved some benefit in clinical trial. As both drugs are cheap and less toxic, if it does, it would be the blessing for the poor people of the globe.\n\nMETHODOLOGY:\n\nStudy type: Interventional Clinical trial Estimated enrollment: 200 participants per group\n\nFor superior trial, the formula is:\n\nN=size per group; p=the response rate of standard treatment group; p0= the response rate of new drug treatment group; zx= the standard normal deviate for a one or two sided x; d= the real difference between two treatment effect; \u03b40= a clinically acceptable margin; S2= Polled standard deviation of both comparison groups.\n\nAll parameters were assumed as follows: p =0.40; p0=0.58; \u03b1=0.05;\u03b2=0.20; \u03b4=0.18; \u03b40=0.10.\n\nHowever, we are assuming that lost to follow up or refuse to include in trial will be 20%, that means 24. So at least 150 patients will be allocated randomly and power of this study will be 80%.\n\nAllocation: Randomized Intervention model: Parallel assignment Intervention model description: Patient will be randomized 1:1 to placaebo with standard care and combined doxycycline and ivermectin with standard care.\n\nBlinding: Double blind (The participant and the clinicians/data collectors will be unaware of the treatment the participant receives) Primary purpose: Treatment Official title: A phase III trial to promote recovery from covid 19 with combined Doxycycline and Ivermectin along standard care. Provider of placebo and active ingredients: Popular pharmaceutical limited Dosage of the drugs: Ivermactin 6 mg 2 tab stat, cap Doxycycline 100 mg 1 cap BD 5 days\n\nData collection technique:\n\nData will be collected by assigned. trained data collectors (Physician). Patient will be enrolled according to defined inclusion and exclusion criteria in the current research. Informed written consent will be obtained from the patient or their relatives. Each patient participating in the trial will be uniquely identified, and information such as his name, address is recorded in the trial 'subject number list'. Only the principle investigator will be aware about the allocation of the drugs. The patients and the data collectors will be unaware about the group allocation of the drugs. The Data will be reviewed by the co-investigators. It will be managed by principle and co-principle investigators in designated computer.\n\nClinical assessment (fever, cough, Anorexia, Temperature, pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation) will be done every day. Routine investigation (CBC, ESR, CRP, Creatinine, RBS, SGPT, chest x-ray, D- Dimer) will be done at admission and at day 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14 day. In case of the clinical deterioration it would done according to necessity. RT-PCR will be done at day-0, Day 5, day 7 and day 14.\n\nStandard care: both the experimental and placebo will receive the available standard of care, like-\n\n* Paracetamol, Antihistamine, Cough suppressant, Vitamins\n* Oxygen therapy according to indication and need\n* Low molecular weight heparin according to indication\n* Appropriate other broad spectrum antibiotics\n* Other drugs for associated co- morbid condition\n\nManagement of the adverse events:\n\nDrugs adverse effect will be monitored by a defined committee. The patient experiencing adverse effect of the drugs will be discontinued from the study. It will be managed with priority to the highest possible level by the hospital authority as well as the investigators.\n\nIf the patient progresses from mild to moderate or severe disease, the study will be continued and available management of the appropriate severity will be immediately started. The patient will be monitored closely.\n\nData analysis:\n\nData will be analyzed by computer with the help of SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) version 26. Unpaired t-test would be used for testing quantitative data and for testing qualitative data two sample z- test will be used. Comparing drug outcome in between two groups hazard ratio, Kaplan-Meire curve will be used.\n\nDropout management: Likelihood based methods such as mixed models will be used to estimate unbiased treatment effects, under assumptions regarding the missingness mechanisms.",

      "detailedDescription": "Acutely ill adult COVID-19 patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) are at risk of life-threatening hypoxia, and are provided supplementary oxygen. Liberal use of supplementary oxygen may increase the number of serious adverse events including death. However, the use of supplementary oxygen therapy, and the optimal oxygenation target in COVID-19 patients have not yet been studied.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends an oxygen therapy during resuscitation of COVID-19 patients to achieve an SpO2 of 94% or more, and 90% or more when stable (non-pregnant patients). The Surviving Sepsis Campaing (SSC) recommends a conservative oxygenation strategy for COVID-19 patients targeting an SpO2 no higher than 96%. Both are based on a systematic review and metanalysis from 2018, investigating the association with mortality and higher versus lower oxygenation strategies in critically ill patients in general.\n\nCOVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU and treated with positive pressure ventilation fulfil the 2012 Berlin criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Current practice regarding supplementary oxygen therapy in patients with ARDS follows the regimen used in an randomised clinical trial (RCT) from 2000 comparing lower versus higher tidal volumes; i.e. a partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) of 55-80 mmHg (7.3-10.7 kPa) or a peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 88-95%.\n\nOf note, a recent published RCT demonstrated a lowered all-cause mortality when targeting a higher oxygenation target (PaO2: 12-14 kPa \\[90-105 mmHg\\]) compared to a lower oxygenation target (PaO2: 7.3-9.3 \\[55-70 mmHg\\]) in ARDS patients.\n\nThe quality and quantity of the current body of evidence regarding oxygenation targets in ARDS is still low.\n\nThe aim of the HOT-COVID trial is to evaluate the benefits and harms of two targets of partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) in guiding the oxygen therapy in acutely ill adults COVID-19 patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure at ICU admission.\n\nThe HOT-COVID trial is an amendment to the HOT-ICU trial (NCT03174002)",

All participants will receive a multivitamin containing vitamin D.",
      "detailedDescription": "Vitamin D (vitD) deficiency is more prevalent among African Americans and Latinx and in the elderly who have low exposure to sunlight. African Americans and nursing home residents who contract SARS-CoV-2, the novel virus that first appeared in Wuhan, China, and who develop the disease designated COVID-19 experience a much worse clinical outcome than other groups. Some have speculated that low vitD status could exacerbate COVID-19 infection, especially if the viral infection reaches the lower respiratory tract.\n\nSufficient vitD may help to improve the pulmonary immune response to the virus, reduce the dangerous cytokine storm, and lessen surfactant dysregulation, potentially preventing or ameliorating the acute syndrome. To maximize the benefits of vitD on host response to SARS-CoV-2, prophylactic supplementation to ensure sufficiency before COVID-19 would be the preferable public health option. Yet, vitD supplementation during acute infection may also improve overall clinical outcome in some infected patients. It is a relatively inexpensive therapy that has a large safety profile when given in doses of 4000-6000 international units/day to adults.\n\nTo date, there is no effective cure or preventive vaccine for COVID-19. Given the risk of disease and death, any intervention that reduces the morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 would be of immense value. We hypothesize that achieving and sustaining vitD sufficiency through dietary supplementation will result in improved immune function and a decrease in COVID-19 incidence and symptomatology. Importantly, this objective will address the significant health disparity of vitD deficiency among black, Latina and the elderly. We further hypothesize that those individuals with a circulating 25(OH)D of \u226540 ng/mL will have less severe COVID-19 symptoms, particularly among higher risk populations. We will compare the effectiveness of higher dose vitD vs. standard of care dosing.To test these hypotheses, we propose the following Aims:\n\n1. Focusing on prevention, this Aim will test whether achieving vitD sufficiency (as defined by total circulating 25(OH)D \u226540-60 ng/mL) in individuals at risk for deficiency will improve clinical outcomes in those who subsequently develop COVID-19.\n2. Focusing on vitD as mitigation therapy, this Aim will evaluate the effectiveness of bolus dosing followed by daily vitD supplementation in achieving the target 25(OH)D range of \u226540-60 ng/mL in those individuals testing positive for COVID-19 at MUSC/affiliated hospital facilities, but do not require admission to a hospital (outpatient) and will examine whether achieving this target range is associated with less severe COVID-19 and differences in inflammatory cytokine profiles.\n\nIn the prevention arm of this project (Aim 1), individuals at higher risk \u226550 years of age who test negative for COVID-19 at MUSC/its affiliate hospitals, and agree to daily vitD supplementation for a 12-month period, with vitD status measured monthly will be randomized to placebo or prescribed vitD (6000 IU/day) to achieve a total circulating 25(OH) concentration of \u226540-60 ng/mL. We will compare study groups regarding subsequent infection with COVID-19, severity of symptoms, need and duration of hospitalization (LOS), admission to the ICU, need for ventilatory support, and mortality, along with return to baseline activities and/or work, as a function of age, BMI, and other recognized COVID-19 risk factors. In the mitigation arm of this project (Aim 2), non-hospitalized individuals \u226550 years of age who test COVID-19 positive will be randomized to placebo or a bolus of oral vitD (20,000 IU X 3 days) followed by 6000 IU vitD/day, and we will compare study groups on measures of disease severity as in Aim 1. All participants in both Aims 1 and 2 will receive a daily multivitamin (MVI) containing 800 IU VitD for the 12-month period.\n\nFollowing the completion of these Aims, we will be able to answer the following questions:\n\n1. Are individuals with vitD deficiency more likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 infection?\n2. Does being vitD replete make a person more likely to have asymptomatic COVID-19?\n3. Does vitD sufficiency status account for why African Americans, Latina, and the elderly more likely to experience complications related to COVID-19?\n4. Is vitD deficiency in COVID-19 positive outpatients associated with increased severity of symptoms and differences in inflammatory cytokine profiles that is mitigated by bolus and then sustained vitD supplementation?\n\nThe long-term impact of these studies will influence public policy regarding more widespread vitD supplementation is a means of reducing the severity of COVID-19. Given its low cost and the ease with which widespread supplementation could be instituted, oral vitD supplementation may represent a rapid and inexpensive means by which to reduce both the COVID-19 incidence and severity.",
      "eligibilityCriteria": "Entry Criteria:\n\n---Adults aged 50 years of age or older who presents to MUSC or its affiliate hospitals (or associated testing centers) for COVID-19 testing during the recruitment period is eligible for participation.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Hospitalization at the time of study recruitment.\n* Any individual less than 50 years of age. The reason that the participants \u226550 years are being excluded from this study is because those who are \u226550 years have a higher risk of being symptomatic with COVID-19 and have the potential for the greatest benefit. The disease appears to manifest differently in children and its occurrence is quite rare.\n* Only those patients tested for COVID-19 initially will be eligible to participate; therefore, anyone wanting to participate in the trial must have had a COVID-19 test prior to enrollment/participation in the study.\n* Any individual who is not capable of making independent decisions and who is considered cognitively impaired."

      "detailedDescription": "Consenting Procedure Patients will be contacted first by phone and, if not available, then by email. Interested patients will make an appointment to visit the GO Health Clinical Research Unit at Adams School of Dentistry for this study. Study participation includes only one visit. For Spanish speaking patients and/or parents, Spanish forms will be provided and communication will occur through a Spanish translator. All patients are adults and over normal cognitive capacity, and therefore will be able to consent for themselves. Screening\n\n* At the visit, a consented patient will answer screening questions regarding inclusion and exclusion criteria. Answers will be entered into the Carolina Data Acquisition and Reporting Tool (CDART) research database managed by UNC.\n* Prior to finalizing these screening questions, women participants of childbearing potential will be asked to provide a urine sample in the restroom, to undergo a rapid pregnancy test by study personnel. Any pregnant or lactating patients will be excluded. Enrollment, Baseline, and/or Randomization Outpatient subjects will be recruited from patients seen in the UNC Respiratory Distress Clinic (RDC) who have tested positive for COVID+ and consented to be contacted for participation in COVID-related research studies. The subjects being approached by phone or email have signed a prior facility consent at the Respiratory Distress Clinic confirming willingness to share their name and contact information to be contacted for study participation in COVID related research. Investigators will not receive information on subjects that decline this internal consent. Subjects will be contacted for recruitment by phone and (if unreachable by phone) by secure email by study personnel; patients will have the study rationale and risks explained and will be provided time to ask questions and consider participation.\n\nIf patients are interested in participating, a single appointment will be scheduled for them at the Adams School of Dentistry GO Health Clinical research core. Consent documentation will be signed in person and in private in the GO Health Clinical Research Core. A list of COVID+ subjects that have consented to be contacted for research, will be provided by the RDC clinic, sent via secure University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill NC servers or secure UNC email to the research team's clinical coordinator, and this list will include names and contact details (PHI). This list is updated daily and provided to approved research sites.\n\nRandomization: The study statistician will create a block randomization schedule and perform these computations. The researcher in charge of collecting the salivary samples will be blinded to the mouthwash solution, as the subject will be given a pre-aliquoted mouthrinse in an unlabeled storage tube to provide to the patient for the rinse.\n\nBlinding Subjects will be provided with an unlabeled/blinded mouthrinse. The researcher in charge of collecting the salivary samples will be blinded to the mouthwash solution as well, as the subject will be given a pre-aliquoted mouthrinse in an unlabeled storage syringe to provide to the patient for the rinse. The study statistician will set up a block randomization schedule that the team will abide by for assignment of enrolled subjects.\n\nFollow-up Visits: This study requires only one 70-90 minute, single visit appointment. No diagnostic tests will be run as part of this clinical trial. All participants will already have known COVID+ status, and therefore no follow-up reporting is needed.\n\nCompletion/Final Evaluation: This study requires only one 70-90 minute, single visit appointment. Subjects will be asked to rinse with an unlabeled/blinded antiviral mouth rinse for 60 seconds and provide 5 mL of saliva prior to the rinse and 2 mL of saliva immediately post-rinse, 15 minutes post-rinse, 30 minutes post-rinse, 45 minutes post-rinse, and 60 minutes post-rinse.

To gain this approval, FDA requires DeltaRex-G to have demonstrated safety and efficacy in early clinical trials.\n\nStudy Design This is a dose-seeking phase 1/2 study using escalating doses of DeltaRex-G given intravenously for 7 days in a hospital setting, with a randomization schema at the MTD.\n\nThe study will include up to three cohorts with increasing DeltaRex-G doses as shown below. The study will employ the standard \"Cohort of Three\" design (Storer, 1989). Three patients are treated at each dose level with expansion to six patients per cohort if DLT is observed in one of the three initially enrolled patients at each dose level. If no DLT occurs in 3 patients, escalation to the next dose level will be permitted. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the highest safely tolerated dose, where not more than one patient experienced DLT, with the next higher dose level having at least two patients who experienced DLT. No intra-patient dose escalation will take place.\n\nPatients within the same cohort of 3 will be treated in a staggered manner, i.e., the next subject will receive the product only after the previous subject has completed administration of all doses and has been evaluated on Day 14 (or one week after last DeltaRex-G infusion) to assess safety. At the MTD, after 3 subjects in same cohort have been evaluated with no DLT, subjects in the same cohort may be treated simultaneously.\n\nPatients who do not complete the 7-day treatment will be replaced except if patient developed DLT.\n\nRandomization Schema:\n\nAt the highest dose level or when MTD is determined, nine (9) additional patients will be randomized to the treatment arm + standard of care (SOC) vs. standard of care alone (n = 6 patients DeltaRex-G and 3 SOC in each group). Patients will be matched according to symptomatology (e.g. SpO2 \\>94% at the time of screening), age (within 10 years or at least less than or greater than 65 years), race (black vs non-black), and gender.\n\nDose of DeltaRex-G: Escalating doses of DeltaRex-G i.v daily for 7 days:\n\nNumber of Pts.

The study will employ the standard \"cohort of three\" design. Three patients are treated at each dose level with expansion to six patients per cohort if DLT is observed in one of the three initially-enrolled patients at each dose level. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the highest safely tolerated dose, where not more than one patient experienced DLT, with the next higher dose level having at least two patients who experienced DLT. No intra-patient escalation will take place.\n\nDose limiting toxicity, maximum tolerated dose, incidence and severity of adverse events and significant laboratory abnormalities is the primary endpoint. Safety analysis will be performed on all patients.\n\nPatient incidence of all treatment-related AEs will be tabulated by system organ class and preferred term. Tables of fatal adverse events, serious adverse events, treatment-related AEs, and adverse events leading to withdrawal from investigation product will also be provided. Summary statistics will be provided for total number of doses, average dose administered, and duration of each treatment.\n\nAnalysis of Secondary Endpoint Efficacy analysis will be conducted. Change in clinical status such as duration of fever, respiratory destress, pneumonia, cough, sneezing, diarrhea will be documented. ECOG score, mortality, length of hospital stay, duration of respirator therapy, duration of intensive care unit stay, and changes in cytokine pattern will be compared to historical controls.",

      "description": "The proposed study is designed to investigate if and how pregnant women infected with Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) infection go on to develop long-term immunity. In December 2019, a group of people in Wuhan, China presented with symptoms of a pneumonia of an unknown cause that led to the discovery of a new coronavirus called COVID-19. COVID-19 has caused a global pandemic with 7,140,000 confirmed cases and 418,000 deaths as of 13th June 2020. In the United Kingdom (UK), there have been 294,000 cases and 41,662 deaths as of 13th June 2020. In humans, this infection primarily involves the upper part of the lungs, but it can also affect other organs. It causes mild symptoms in the majority of people affected but some people can have severe infections, with some even requiring critical care in hospital. During Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a previous coronavirus epidemic, pregnant women were disproportionately affected with severe illness. Understanding how the immune system responds long-term to this infection may hold the key to developing better vaccines and efficient treatment plans. Specialised immunity develops when individuals are infected by this and other viruses. The investigators of this study propose that, in pregnancy, this specialised immunity may not behave effectively. This may affect their ability to develop long lasting immunity and make them more vulnerable to re-infection. In this study, the investigators aim to recruit patients across 6 groups including COVID-19 newly infected pregnant women, and people with differing illness severity, mild to moderate, severe/critical, no infection (controls), as well as pregnant women with influenza and those receiving influenza vaccine. The study team will compare COVID-19 in pregnancy with non-pregnant infected and with influenza infected and vaccinated pregnant women. The study team will consent patients in all of these groups to provide a series of blood samples at different time points in a 12-month period.",
      "detailedDescription": "Background\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), commonly known as Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19), is a global pandemic with 7,410,000 confirmed cases and 418,000 deaths as of 13th June 2020. It is believed that SARS-CoV-2 shares 79.6% of its sequence identity with SARS-CoV and resembles some clinical outcomes like viral pneumonia. However, it causes milder symptoms in majority of people infected, and can be an asymptomatic infection in some individuals. Just in the 21st century, we have seen three major coronavirus (CoV) outbreaks: SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and the novel SARS-CoV-2, which have resulted in many deaths and have posed a real threat to public health. In fact, during SARS more pregnant women required intensive care and ventilation, and the number of deaths was higher when compared to non-pregnant adults. This is partly because in pregnancy, the risk of viral pneumonia is greater compared to the general population.\n\nUnderstanding T and B cell mediated immunity in COVID-19 participants may hold the key to developing better vaccines and efficient treatment plans. To date there is only one study that has investigated circulatory T follicular helper cells (cTFH), which like there germinal centre counterparts are a specialised effector cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) T cell that induces B cell activation, and differentiation into class-switched and antibody secreting long-lasting plasmablasts. This study observed an increase in cTFH during pregnancy. However, studies in older patients, which comprise another high risk group, have shown mixed results with cTFH showing lower levels of activation. This will impact on long term antibody production following infection or vaccination. We propose that circulatory cTFH, and B cells may not be as activated in both pregnant women and patients with severe to critical patients when compared with mild to moderate patients resulting in less or poorly functioning anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Therefore, we expect in infected pregnant individuals the development of long-term immunity may be worse when compared to non-pregnant people with similar disease severity, making them more susceptible to re-infection. Compared to influenza, which is another respiratory illness with significant morbidity in pregnancy and has a current vaccination program, we expect that the same measures of immunity will be less pronounced post COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, the development of long-term immunity will be less effective in patients with severe illness, who for the most part, comprise a particularly high-risk group including the elderly and patients with multiple comorbidities. It is vital that we expand our knowledge of long-lasting immunity in individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 to see how long these individuals are protected against re-infection and whether they develop long lasting immunity. Moreover, there is no current research establishing the parameters of seroprotective immunity. Previous research has suggested that SARS-CoV specific Immunoglobin G (IgG) declines significantly within 2 years with some reports showing a complete loss within 6 years in most SARS-CoV recovered patients. This may equate to a loss of long-term protection. The investigators of this study propose measuring SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG levels by doing memory B cell (Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSpot) ELISpots and comparing the data with cTFH and B cell flow cytometry panels. The research team will be able to profile the generation and persistence of protective antibodies produced by infected individuals who go on to recover. The findings from this study will generate hypotheses to be tested in larger studies of COVID-19 recovered pregnant patients, and also assist researchers working trying to understand the effectiveness of the vaccines in pregnancy once these become commercially available.\n\nResearch Question\n\nIn pregnant individuals who have recovered from COVID-19:\n\nA. How long will their SARS-CoV-2 specific Immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels remain in peripheral blood, what is the rate of decline and how does this compare to non-pregnant individuals?\n\nB. How did their T cell mediated immune function differ from non-pregnant patients during the infection?\n\nC. How do their SARS-CoV-2 specific memory T cell differ when compared to severe to non-pregnant patients' post-recovery?\n\nD. How does antibody production, and B and T cell function post COVID-19 infection in pregnancy compare with influenza infection and vaccination?\n\nHypothesis\n\nThe investigators hypothesise that pregnant patients with COVID-19 will develop a less robust and measurable B-cell response when compared to influenza infected/vaccinated women and non-pregnant individuals, and that their seroprotective antibody responses will decline by 12 months post infection.\n\nStudy Aims\n\nA. Establish robust assays to measure SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG from individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 infection and track these levels over a 12-month period to measure any decline. In pregnancy, compare this to influenza antibodies produced after infection and vaccination.\n\nB. Measure frequency of activated cTFH, and antigen-secreting cells (ASCs) at days 7-14 of symptom onset in pregnant patients with COVID-19 and compare with non-pregnant groups, and pregnant influenza infected and influenza vaccinated. In addition, compare between non-pregnant groups with mild to moderate symptoms when compared to severe to critical patients.\n\nC. Measure frequency of activated memory B cells at day 28 in pregnant patients with COVID-19 and compare with non-pregnant groups, and pregnant influenza infected and influenza vaccinated. In addition, compare between non-pregnant groups with mild to moderate symptoms when compared to severe to critical patients.\n\nD. Measure frequency of CD4 and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) T cells in pregnant patients with COVID-19 and compare with non-pregnant groups, and pregnant influenza infected and influenza vaccinated. In addition, compare between non-pregnant groups with mild to moderate symptoms when compared to severe to critical patients.\n\nE. Quantify antigen-specific memory T cells and measure frequency of activated T cells in all patient groups.\n\nF. Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 viral load from infected participants.\n\nStudy Design\n\nThis study will be a prospective observational project to investigate the potential decline of protective immunity in pregnancy after participants have recovered from SARS-CoV-2. The research team will compare these findings with non-pregnant patients who have had COVID-19 and developed mild to moderate symptoms or severe to critical participants. Patients who go on to join a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trial will not be excluded but the vaccination date will be recorded, and their results interpreted accordingly. In order to compare COVID-19 infection with another respiratory infection and assess long term protective immunity with an intervention already in place in this patient group designed to provide seroprotective antibodies, the investigators will investigate influenza and influenza vaccine. Therefore, data from pregnant patients will also be compared with influenza infected pregnant women and those who have received the influenza vaccination.",

Such data is essential for understanding rate of involvement, type of involvement and degree of injury in patients contracting the disease.",
      "detailedDescription": "Since Dec 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in considerable morbidity and mortality throughout the world. On April 21 2020, Italy and US have registered over 187,000 and 855,000 cases of confirmed COVID-19 disease respectively, with one of the highest death rates in the world, which stands at more than 25,000 individuals in Italy and 47,000 in US. Epidemiologic modeling from multiple groups indicate the scope of the problem, with a potential for over 200,000 deaths in the U.S. alone, with large percentage of the population infected. Mortality from COVID-19 is associated with the presence of severe respiratory illness, although recent studies indicate 20%-30% of patients have evidence of COVID-19 associated cardiac injury defined as decline in ejection fraction or troponin I elevation (1,2). Anecdotal evidence suggests the presence of abnormal EKG findings compatible with myocardial ischemia but whether this is from epicardial coronary thrombosis, myocarditis, or microvascular thrombosis remains uncertain although all have been postulated (3). Regardless, patients with cardiac injury have higher mortality than those without, and sudden cardiac death has been described in some of these patients (1). Two thirds of patients with cardiovascular history were more likely to develop cardiac complications (4). Isolated reports have described fulminant myocarditis in the setting of high viral load with autopsy findings consistent with inflammatory mononuclear infiltrates (5). However, no systematic autopsy studies of patients dying from COVID-19 have ever been conducted. The Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo had treated about 2000 patients with COVID-19 and performed systematic cardiac autopsies from a series of 60 patients who died or presented with/without a picture of cardiac injury and were COVID-19 positive. Detailed clinical data on all these patients are available.\n\nBackground Much about the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and the heart remains unknown. Angiotensin (AT) converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the cellular receptor for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 but also as an endogenous counter- regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). ACE2 is ubiquitously expressed with the highest levels detected in the cardiovascular system (cardiomyocytes, cardiac fibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells) as well as gut, kidneys and lungs. In general, loss of ACE2 increases susceptibility to cardiovascular disease such as myocardial infarction and hypertension while gain of function ACE2 has shown protective roles in various models of cardiovascular disease (6). The bifunctional role of ACE2 as a receptor for SARS-COV-2 but also as a protective factor against cardiovascular disease means careful understanding of the role of ACE2 during SARS-CoV-2 is needed. In this proposal investigators will examine cardiac tissues from patients dying of COVID-19 and examine the effect of infection on the expression of ACE2 on various cardiac cells. Investigators will also evaluate and validate this hypothesized mechanism of viral entry by ACE2 and trans-membrane serine protease which promotes entry of SARS-COV-2 into cells through a separate mechanisms.\n\nStudy Aims:\n\n1. Describe the cardiac pathological findings from series of 60 patients dying from COVID-19 using cardiac samples sent to CVPath Institution from Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy to study the correlations between clinical risk factors and myocardial findings and difference from other viral myocarditis;\n2. Understand the relationship between viral load in cardiac tissues and the extent of damage seen on myocardial histological sections; and\n3. Co-localize the SARS-CoV-2 using RNAscope in situ hybridization, with its entry receptor ACE2 and serine protease TMPRSS2 (type II transmembrane serine protease) in different cell types found in the heart, such as endothelial, smooth muscle, myocardial, fibroblastic and inflammatory cells, to better understand the pathogenesis of the disease.\n\nMethods:\n\nThe study was approved by ethical committee at Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital and the CVPath Institute IRB (Institutional Review Board).\n\nAll specimens are fixed in 10% buffered formalin. Hearts will be shipped to CVPath in accordance with all international shipping regulations and U.S. CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines (www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-postmortem specimens.html). The sample is given a unique identifier and the hearts are weighed after blood clots have been removed from the cavities, and the heart ventricles are sliced parallel to the posterior atrioventricular junction to determine absence of any necrosis or fibrosis. Pulmonary emboli and any right ventricular abnormalities are assessed to rule out any attributable cause of death. The heart is weighed and radiographed and if any calcification is observed the epicardial coronary arteries are removed intact away from the heart and segments decalcified according to the extent of calcification. The rest of the arteries are submitted for paraffin embedding at 3-4 mm intervals to rule out any significant atherosclerosis (75 % cross-sectional area stenosis) or any thrombosis.\n\nIn total six sections of myocardium (anterior, posterior, and lateral LV (left ventricle), ventricular septum, anterior and posterior wall of the right ventricle) are routinely taken transversely, embedded in paraffin, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H\\&amp;E) for histologic evaluation. If specific pathology is observed, additional sections will be submitted to determine the etiology of the findings. Histologic examination is performed to rule out any infiltrative or inflammatory process or any myofiber disarray of the myocardium, intramyocardial small vessel disease of interstitial or focal fibrosis. Presence of any cardiomyopathic process will be ruled out by gross and histologic examination. If the post-mortem interval is short, transmission electron microscopic (TEM) examination will be performed to determine the presence of virus and the cell type harboring the virus.\n\nCorrelations with autopsy findings will be made with available anonymized clinical data including EKG, echocardiography and cardiac catheterization (where available). The cardiac pathological characteristics of COVID-19 will be compared to 60 viral myocarditis cases that have previously been collected in CVPath Registry. A RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) specifically designed for SARS-CoV-2 will be conducted on RNA extracted from myocardial samples to quantitate the amount of virus in myocardium for each sample. RNA samples will also be taken from coronary arteries as well. Calculated viral load will be correlated with the myocardial injury scores including myocardial necrosis, myocardial infarction, myocarditis, inflammatory cells numbers, type, etc.\n\nRNAscope In-situ hybridization. In situ detection of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in endothelial (VE-cadherin), myocardial (Cx43 and Myh6), smooth muscle cell (SM22 alpha) and lymphocytes (CD3, CD4, CD8) will be performed using an RNAscope assay with RNAscope Probe-V-nCoV2019-S-sense and Probe-V-nCoV2019-S (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) following the manufacturer's protocols. Correlation will be made with specific cell types mentioned by dual immunofluorescence as previously described (7) .\n\nThis study will result in a greater understanding of the pathology of cardiac injury in patients with COVID-19. Doing so will open the door to develop new therapeutic options to treat these patients during an epidemic of unparalleled size and scope.",

      "description": "COVID-19 pandemic has made a tremendous impact on Indonesian economic and health care system especially with the double burden of diseases facing by Indonesia as a developing country. The prevalence of non-communicable diseases such as obesity, type diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases is increasing. These diseases along with older age have been known as an established risk factors for higher mortality and severe clinical disease entity in COVID-19 infection. Although, there is still some part of patients with these co-morbidities that only present with mild symptoms when infected with SARS-CoV-2, even for some without any symptoms. Thus, it would be very interesting to evaluate how are these role of aging and cardiometabolic parameters in the clinical disease course of COVID-19 infection, and how are the relationship with the immune system.",
      "detailedDescription": "Indonesia is a country in transition where the burden of non-communicable diseases is taking over the infectious diseases problem, mostly due to the changes in lifestyle and increase in life expectancy.\n\nHowever, the unprecedented rising numbers of COVID-19 patients in Indonesia has impacted the Indonesian healthcare system heavily. It has been reported that older age and the presence of cardiometabolic risk factors pose a poor prognostic factor of COVID-19. It is also important to note that in Indonesia, the presence of cardiometabolic risk factors is often observed at a younger age. Thus, this might also contribute to the higher mortality of COVID19 infected patients despite their relatively younger age in comparison to other countries. Nevertheless, specific data on the impact of aging and cardiometabolic risk factors on COVID-19 are fragmentary, justifying the achievement of a dedicated prospective observational study.\n\nThe CARAMEL study aims to specifically describe the phenotypic aging and cardiometabolic characteristics of patients with COVID-19 infection, in relation with the changes in the mucosal and systemic immune system. Particular attention will be devoted to obesity, central obesity, prediabetes, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, as well as anti-diabetic, antihypertensive, and anti-dyslipidemia therapies.\n\nThis study will provide answers to researchers, medical professionals, and especially patients, regarding the impact of aging and cardiometabolic risk factors for COVID-19 prognosis. This pilot study will be used for the development of new studies and for the establishment of recommendations for the care of patients with cardiometabolic risk factors and COVID-19.",

The number of infections increased rapidly, and more patients were identified in other provinces in China, and in various countries in the Far East, Europe and the United States. With few exceptions, patients became infected while staying in China. The cause of the disease has been identified as a virus from the corona family - SARS-CoV-2 and the new name given to the disease. (COVID-19) Coronavirus disease The virus belongs to a family of respiratory viruses that often cause mild respiratory illness, however, viruses from this family have also caused epidemics of severe respiratory infections. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the corona virus a global pandemic. The average incubation period (from exposure to the onset of clinical symptoms) is 6 days, with a range of 2 to 11 days. Common symptoms of coronary heart disease include: fever, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches.Some patients develop complications, including pneumonia, respiratory failure, myocarditis and death. Similar to other respiratory viruses, 2019-nCov is transmitted by respiratory droplets. Diagnosis is made by PCR examination from a sample of the upper respiratory tract (pharynx and nose).\n\nIn the literature accumulated in recent months suggests that haemato-oncology patients are at increased risk for severe corona disease and mortality.

      "description": "Unhealthy alcohol use is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in the US. Although effective prevention for unhealthy alcohol use and medication treatment for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) can be provided in primary care (PC), they have historically not been included in routine services. As a result, most patients do not receive evidence-based prevention or treatment for unhealthy alcohol use. Several efforts have successfully implemented alcohol-related preventive care-referred to as screening and brief intervention (SBI), but efforts to increase treatment of AUDs with medications have been less successful. Moreover, implementation efforts have usually neglected smaller PC practices, in which most PC is provided.\n\nThe Michigan SPARC trial is a partnership between Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (KPWHRI) in Seattle, bringing extensive expertise implementing evidence-based alcohol-related care, and Altarum Institute in Ann Arbor, Michigan, bringing demonstrated success engaging over 500 small to medium Michigan-based PC practices in effective quality improvement (QI) efforts. The project builds on Altarum's innovative approach to implementing new or improved clinical care using practice facilitators to provide continuing medical education and maintenance of certification (CME/MOC) programs to PC providers, along with ongoing support for QI using evidence-based implementation strategies. The KPWHRI team recently finished the highly successful AHRQ-funded Sustained Patient-centered Alcohol-Related Care (SPARC) trial using similar implementation strategies in KP Washington, including use of electronic health records and performance monitoring and feedback, and also developed a patient decision aid to support shared decision-making between patients with high-risk drinking and/or AUDs and their PC providers.\n\nThe Michigan SPARC trial combines Altarum's expertise in QI in small-medium PC practices in Michigan with KPWHRI's expertise implementing evidence-based prevention and treatment of unhealthy alcohol use-specifically alcohol SBI and medication treatment for AUDs.\n\nSpecific Aims of the Michigan SPARC trial had to be markedly modified due to the trial beginning in March 2020 at the same time as the COVID pandemic. A trial was not possible. The revised aims were to describe alcohol screening, brief intervention, AUD diagnosis and initiation of medication treatment for AUD, before and after the Michigan SPARC model was implemented, in small to medium PC practices in Michigan.",

      "detailedDescription": "The proposed study is an online experiment. Students enrolled at National University of Singapore are recruited to participate in the study.\n\nParticipants will first complete a pre-experiment survey, which contains basic demographic questions. Then, participants will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: \"Survey\" and \"Prediction Market\".\n\n\"SURVEY\" CONDITION:\n\nParticipants in the \"Survey\" condition are asked 16 prediction questions in a survey format. The questions are of the following format:\n\n\"What do you think will be the total cumulative number of cases in Singapore on 8th of June, at 12pm?\"\n\nEach question has 5 answer options. Each answer option is a range of outcomes, e.g. \"\\< 28,900\", \"between 28,900 and 33,899\", \"between 33,900 and 38,899\", \"between 38,900 and 43,899\", and \"\\> 43,899\". Participants are required to enter their perceived likelihood of each answer option in %.\n\nThe 16 prediction questions come from the following variations: 4 countries (Mexico, Singapore, Turkey, USA) x 2 outcome measures (cases, deaths) x 2 time periods (8th of June, 6th of July).\n\nParticipants have 24 hours to submit their predictions.\n\nAfter the 24-hour period, participants are requested to fill out a post-experiment survey, which includes questions about their subjective attitudes and fears towards COVID-19.\n\n\"PREDICTION MARKET\" CONDITION:\n\nFor participants in the \"Prediction Market\" condition, the same 16 prediction questions are presented in the form of prediction markets. The prediction market is a well-established method of eliciting people's predictions. The method is briefly described below.\n\nThere are 16 prediction markets, one for each question. Participants are given 100 tokens per market, which can be used to buy \"stocks\" on possible outcomes. There are 5 possible outcomes per market (identical to the 5 answer options per question in the \"Survey\" condition).\n\nEach stock (i.e., possible outcome) will have a price that is dynamically determined by the central marketplace, which is a function of real-time demand and supply of the option. If the option is popular, its price will become higher, and vice versa.\n\nParticipants can trade at any time, and as many times as they want, during a 24-hour period. Upon closure of the prediction market, participants will be rewarded proportional to the number of shares that they hold on options that later turn out to be true.\n\nThe final prices of stocks correspond to the group's predictions of COVID-19.\n\nAfter the 24-hour period, participants are requested to fill out a post-experiment survey, which includes questions about their subjective attitudes and fears towards COVID-19.\n\n=====\n\nHYPOTHESES\n\nThe prediction market leads to better predictions about COVID-19. The investigators will compare the survey predictions and the prediction-market predictions with the actual realized outcome. The investigators hypothesize that the prediction-market predictions are more accurate than the survey predictions through information aggregation.\n\nThe prediction market reduces fear. Fear is measured by participants' responses to subjective attitude questions in the post-experiment survey.",

      "detailedDescription": "The primary objective of this study is to determine whether intranasal application of aminoglycoside (Neosporin) increases local nasal innate immune responses compared to placebo control in healthy participants.\n\nThis study will evaluate the role of nasally applied neomycin at inducing local antiviral interferon responses that have been associated with protection against SARS-CoV2 ( severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). Local interferon immune responses including the nasal compartment are important in driving early protective responses against the virus. Given the current challenges with vaccine access in lower- and middle-income countries (LMIC) as well as varying vaccine acceptance and hesitancy, additional strategies are needed to help curb the spread of SARS-CoV2. There is a need for easily available agents that are low cost and effective at decreasing the effects of SARS-CoV2 exposure. The investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of intranasal Neosporin (which contains neomycin) at inducing interferon responses in human subjects.\n\nThis will be a proof of concept that such approach will provide local immune response that could be beneficial against the SARS-CoV2 infection. The potential impact of this study is the utilization of existing and available topical medications for the purpose of providing local prophylaxis against SARS-CoV2.\n\nThe overall hypothesis is that neomycin containing agents such as Neosporin when applied topically in the nose can induce local antiviral interferon responses in adult human subjects. Neosporin will be compared to placebo, control Vaseline (Unilever) or equivalent. A run-in cohort of 6 participants to test optimal sampling and storage conditions will be used. The focus of this study is the randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial.\n\nThe study will enroll an estimated 40 healthy subjects at one study site, Yale University. Local nasal immune responses will be measured using RT-PCR and multiplex ELISA for interferon response. Participants will apply a small amount of the cream (less than a pea size) to the inside of both nostrils, then pinch the nose to spread the cream. Participants will use Neosporin or placebo twice a day for 7 days.",

      "detailedDescription": "SARS-CoV-2, an emerging respiratory virus of the coronavirus family, is responsible for a global pandemic of which Europe has become the epicentre. Infection with the virus causes a disease called COVID-19, whose expression most often includes cough, fever, fatigue, myalgia, anosmia, ageusia and gastrointestinal symptoms, and which can be complicated by severe pneumonia requiring resuscitation and which can lead to death. Morbidity and mortality are clearly age-related and while illness and hospitalisations occur in all age groups, deaths occur mostly in the older age groups.\n\nIn the absence of curative treatment and vaccination, the only real measures capable of slowing the progression of the disease are large-scale social distancing measures. In analogy to community-based viral epidemics such as seasonal influenza, children were initially considered a potential vector of transmission, which led to the preventive measure of school closures. In France, this closure came into force on 14 March 2020.\n\nChildren are considered to be little affected by the coronavirus-19 epidemic because even if screening strategies differ, they represent less than 3% of the cases confirmed in the various studies.\n\nIn a period of confinement and reduction in the number of children cared for, in a cr\u00e8che for children of healthcare workers, in a context of proximity and high risk of cross transmission, the frequency of symptomatic and asymptomatic forms of SARS-Cov-2 in children and staff would be comparable to the general population.\n\nWe hypothesize a susceptibility to infection in children but low transmission, which should lead to a cumulative prevalence of infection among daycare staff comparable to that obtained in a sample of professionals who do not come into contact with children in their work (here hospital laboratory and administrative staff).",

This research project has three aims: first, provide novel insights regarding the incidence, patient characteristics and outcome of myocarditis. Second, provide a safety net by active surveillance for myocarditis, allowing early initiation of appropriate therapy. Third, provide reassurance to the public regarding myocarditis, as questions have been raised by critics of the pharmaceutical industry that Phase III studies performed by the pharmaceutical industry may have not appropriately captured adverse events.\n\nThis study is screening persons undergoing the COVID-19 mRNA booster vaccination of possible development of myocarditis. This approach in detecting myocarditis would help early initiation of the right treatment under close monitoring of the clinical course. Furthermore, this kind of study might also help understand the development of myocarditis and possibly the reasons for sex differences. Myocarditis suspicion is raised when patients present symptoms of acute chest discomfort, myalgia, fever/chills, abnormal ECG, increased concentrations of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), possibly supported by signs of cardiac inflammation in cMRI (myocardial oedema, myocardial/pericardial late gadolinium enhancement, pericardial effusion). Since the study is performed on health care professionals working in the University Hospital Basel, it is able to monitor more closely the possible side effects of the mRNA vaccination.

Global confinement impacts all social and economic fields of human activity. Clinical behavior exceeds the capabilities of public health care. With the initial information on the pandemic, it is estimated that 20% of health personnel in direct contact with patients can acquire the disease, despite preventive self-care. The molecular relationship of COVID-19 with the subject's ACE2 protein encourages the virus to enter the host cell, and initiates replication and the immune response, causing an imbalance generating an immunological storm of cytokines, with serious damage to the host.\n\nObjective: It is proposed to supply a combined scheme of two compounds by oropharyngeal spray that captures the virus before entering the target cell and orally administer immunomodulatory compounds that regulate the inflammatory response released by the virus, in order to improve the antiviral response.\n\nMethodology: A controlled, parallel design, triple-blind, phase II clinical trial will be conducted with two study groups to compare the active compounds (oropharyngeal spray and emulsion) with placebo.\n\nDiscussion: With the application of the combined scheme of two compounds, a 75% reduction in infection is expected for workers in direct contact with COVID patients.",
      "detailedDescription": "RESEARCH QUESTION: Can the oropharyngeal spray of a viral blocking compound in conjunction with the provision of an immunostimulant emulsion, reduce the infection proportion by 2/3\n\nACTIVE PRINCIPLE Intervention 1. BlockACE2\u00ae spray, antimicrobial and antiviral liquid solution for mouth spray, composed of 3 natural bioactive substances proven to be used in humans, which present molecular structures homologous to the native receptor of the virus. It contains binding peptides that resemble the ACE2 receptor, which bind to viral fractions, and acts as soluble scavengers of the virus at the entrance gate, upper respiratory tract, or oropharyngeal region, preventing its entry into the target cell and decreasing the amount of virus that enters the body; consequently, they reduce their ability to generate damage.\n\nBlockACE2\u00ae Defense, food for oral administration in the form of an emulsion with 8 bioactive components that have shown modulation of the inflammatory response. Contains natural oils, Vitamin B6, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Vitamin D3 100 SD / S, and minerals; key micronutrients that are not normally obtained through a traditional diet. These nutrients are immunostimulants with proven capacity to enhance the cellular response against viruses, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and chemoprotective activity, stimulating the production of interferon I; and as a whole, they prevent the generation of an excessive immune activation process, known as an \"immune storm\" mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines.\n\nIntervention 2, Placebo:\n\nPreparations without active components in the pharmaceutical form of the above (Intervention 1 and Intervention 2). They will be presented with the same physical characteristics such as size, shape, color, taste, smell, consistency, printed signs, weight, surface finish, internal and external; in order to guarantee the principle of masking.\n\nRESEARCH HYPOTHESIS:\n\nIn a population with community risk of COVID-19 infection, the combined use of the study interventions (the oral antimicrobial solution in Spray BlockACE2\u00ae and the food in BlockACE2\u00ae emulsion, compared to the use of Placebo, reduces the risk of COVID-19 infection expressed in a negative PCR result in those who seroconvert to IgM, and in those who seroconvert, the higher proportion will be in the mild-moderate clinical form.\n\nPRIMARY OBJECTIVE To establish the efficacy of the combined use of BlockACE2\u00ae oropharyngeal spray, and BlockACE2\u00ae emulsion, in comparison with placebo on the reduction of the risk of infection by COVID-19, expressed in the negative result of immunoglobulins for COVID-19 (30 days from admission to the project).\n\nEstablish the safety of the products under study by evaluating the expected and unexpected adverse events that are recorded during the use phase of the intervention scheme (30 days from project entry).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE To establish the efficacy of the combined use of BlockACE2\u00ae spray, a soluble virus scavenger compound plus ingestion of BlockACE2\u00ae emulsion, a compound that improves the defenses of the immune system, compared to placebo, on reducing the risk of infection by COVID-19 expressed in the clinical response of the disease that is defined in three variables, mild to moderate: onset of fever, myalgia, and cough without dyspnea; severe: fever, myalgia, cough and dyspnea requiring hospital care; and critical: all the above plus ventilatory assistance in ICU.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES Explore the efficacy of the combined use of BlockACE2\u00ae spray, a soluble virus scavenger compound, plus the intake of BlockACE2\u00ae, an emulsion food with key micronutrients that stimulate the antiviral cellular immune response on reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection expressed in the negative result of IgG, IgM; and the reduction of the risk of symptoms such as fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia, or ventilatory assistance in the ICU after 15 days of finishing the scheme.\n\nFIELD OF STUDY: Workers of every department of Conconcreto Company in the city of Medell\u00edn and Girardota\n\nINTERVENTIONS:\n\nIntervention 1 BLOCKACE2: Two oropharyngeal sprays of the compound, every 4 hours, during the day. For the BlockACE2 emulsion will be used 20 ml during the first 5 days and after it only 10ml every day for 30 days. Dosing of the substances in intervention 1 follows the described pharmacological characteristics, that guarantee its permanence in the oral mucosa to protect the entry pathway of the virus into the organism (Oropharynx). The dosage of the oral compounds was defined according to recommendations of the WHO for the modulation of the immune response (Emulsion).\n\nIntervention 2 PLACEBO: spray and emulsion with similar color, smell, and texture but without the natural active compounds.\n\nIn the randomization visit V1, each participant will be assigned a treatment scheme, composed of intervention 1 and intervention 2, in sufficient quantity for the duration of the study. The pharmaceutical service will dispense the code of the scheme, following a sequential order, indicated in an allocation listing of the schemes on site.

      "detailedDescription": "SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, has affected vulnerable individuals, especially those with comorbidities, and high exposure health care workers (HCWs). Typically, the virus first colonizes in the upper respiratory tract (URT) causing clinical symptoms such as coughing, sore throat, and then is transferred to the lower respiratory tract (LRT) which can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, and death, if it is not managed.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has presented comprehensive guidelines underscoring personal hygiene measures including respiratory hygiene against SARS, MERS, influenza, and now SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19. While personal protection equipment (PPE), personal hygiene measures, environmental infection control, and physical distancing are crucial in mitigating disease transmission, respiratory hygiene measures do not prevent SARS-CoV-2 colonization in URTs and LRTs of infected individuals (symptomatic and asymptomatic).\n\nExperimental and clinical research studies on infections similar to COVID-19 such as SARS, MERS, and H5N1 have shown that using antiseptic mouthwash/gargling solutions, such as products containing chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG), polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine (PVP-I), chlorine dioxide (ClO2), cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can reduce viral load. A randomized controlled trial (N=387) showed efficacy and cost-effectiveness of gargling with water or a product containing PVP-I (3X/day, 20 seconds) on URTIs in healthy volunteers (18-65 years) over 60 days from a societal perspective; in vitro studies have shown that CloSYS, an over the counter mouthwash containing ClO2, was effective on inactivating SARS-CoV as well as disinfecting dental unit waterlines, and biofilm control in ultrasonic dental scaling units. A recent study has shown that CloSYS Ultra Sensitive Oral Rinse reduced the viral load of SARS CoV 2, SARS CoV, and Influenza A H3N2 to a varying extent. The data show that the viral load reduction of SARS CoV 2 by Ultra Sensitive rinse was 10 fold more than the reduction of SARS CoV in 30s. Recently, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the American Dental Association (ADA) have recommended using a mouthwash containing 1.0-1.5% H2O2 as a pre-procedural rinse before dental treatment to potentially reduce SARS-CoV-2 load; however, no in vivo clinical studies have been conducted to support this claim.\n\nThe aim of this pilot trial is to evaluate the effect of four over-the-counter antiseptic mouthwash/gargling solutions compared to a control (distilled water) to reduce SARS-CoV-2 load. In addition, study participants will be assessed for the severity of their clinical symptoms during the study period. The 4-week protocol was selected as studies have shown that patients can continue to shed the virus and potentially transmit it to the others for a 2 to 4 week period. An interim analysis is planned when 10 participants per arm (50 total) complete the study using the alpha-spending function with O'Brien-Fleming boundary rule.",

With the growing international transportation and improving accessibility of the healthcare systems, hospitals have been inevitably the first sentinels dealing with emerging infectious diseases. The biological disasters, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korean in 2015, and the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak this year, challenged our vulnerable healthcare systems and caused great loss of lives.\n\nRegarding the ongoing global epidemics and possible community outbreaks of the COVID-19, the management of biological disasters for an overcrowded emergency department should be planned. In the early 2020, the emergency department used a double-triage and telemedicine method to treat non-critical patient with suspected COVID-19. This application reduced the exposure time of the first responders and reserve adequate interview quality. However, for the critical patients treated in the isolated resuscitation rooms, the unique environment limited the teamwork and communication for the resuscitation team. These factors might led to poorer quality of critical care.\n\nThe investigators designed a telemedicine-teamwork model, which connected the isolation room, prepare room and nursing station by an video-conferencing system in the emergency department. This model try to break the barriers of space between the rooms and facilitate the teamwork communications between each unit. Besides, by providing a more efficient workflow, this model could lower the total exposure time for all workers in the contaminated area. This study was conducted to evaluate the benefits of the telemedicine-teamwork model and provide a practical, safe and effective alternative to critical care of the patients with suspected highly infectious diseases.",

      "description": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the newly discovered coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The median time from onset of symptoms of COVID-19 to development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been reported as short as 9 days. No effective prophylactic or post-exposure therapy is currently available. According to data from the Danish Health Authority (www.sst.dk/corona), as of March 21st, 2020, there were 1326 patients infected with the disease in Denmark, more than 250 are admitted to a hospital, and \\>50 of them have required intensive care. Nearly 350.000 cases and 15.000 deaths have been reported globally. These numbers are likely to markedly increase during the coming weeks, challenging the capacity of health systems worldwide.\n\nIn patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, it has been described that disease severity and outcomes are related to the characteristics of the immune response. Interleukin (IL)-6 and other components of the inflammatory cascade contribute to host defense against infections. However, exaggerated synthesis of IL-6 can lead to an acute severe systemic inflammatory response known as 'cytokine storm'. In the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, a study found that a cytokine storm involving a considerable release of proinflammatory cytokines occurred, including IL-6, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). Studies on the Middle East respiratory syndrome caused by another coronavirus (MERS-CoV), indicate that cytokine genes of IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-8 can be markedly upregulated. Similarly, patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia admitted to an intensive care unit had higher plasma levels of cytokines including IL-6, IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), interferon-\u03b3-inducible protein (IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP1A), and TNF-\u03b1. These findings indicate that the magnitude and characteristics of the cytokine response is related to the severity and prognosis of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\nIt has been suggested that IL-6 blockade may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy for other types of cytokine storm, such as the systemic inflammatory response syndrome including sepsis, macrophage activation syndrome and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Remarkable beneficial effects of IL-6 blockade therapy using a IL-6 receptor inhibitor has been described in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in a retrospective case series from China.\n\nCurrently, there are two available drugs based on human monoclonal antibodies against IL-6 receptor, tocilizumab (RoActemra, Roche) and sarilumab (Kevzara, Sanofi). IL-6 receptor inhibitors are currently licensed for several autoimmune disorders and are considered well tolerated and safe in general. The most common side effects reported are upper respiratory tract infections, headache, hypertension, and abnormal liver function tests. The most serious side effects are serious infections, complications of diverticulitis, and hypersensitivity reactions.\n\nit is hypothesized that IL-6 might play a key role in the cytokine storm associated with serious adverse outcomes in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, and that blockade of IL-6 would be suitable therapeutic target for these patients. The study will investigate the effect of different types of IL-6 inhibition versus no adjuvant treatment compared to standard of care in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.\n\nPrimary objective: To compare the effect of either one of three IL-6 inhibitor administrations, relative to the standard of care, on time to independence from supplementary oxygen therapy, measured in days from baseline to day 28, in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.",

      "description": "Overweight and obesity, understood as an accumulation of abnormal and excessive fat, are the second leading cause of preventable and avoidable mortality in developed countries, with more than 340 million children and adolescents affected by this disease worldwide. As a consequence, overweight and obesity at an early age is already considered a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), with a high incidence in developed countries.\n\nThe abuse of new technologies has remained at worrying levels in the post-COVID period, favoring an increase in the adolescent population considered sedentary. In this regard, up to 70% of adolescents show sedentary behaviors, especially affecting the time spent on screens by both males (93.8%) and females (87.2%). Thus, the use of the cell phone has been shown to be a determining factor, since between 10% and 16% of adolescents show a problematic use of this device, affecting, among other aspects, their behavior during their free time.\n\nIn recent years there has been an increase in sedentary time among adolescents and a decrease in the practice of physical activity that has favored a greater accumulation of body fat and increased the probability of being overweight or obese. In this context, some studies have tried to encourage the practice of physical activity in the school context in overweight and obese population, being these interventions effective to improve body composition.\n\nHowever, these interventions also have their detractors, who argue that the hours of Physical Education are too limited to dedicate so much time to a single content, and that the pedagogical component is often overlooked in their implementation. As an alternative to the above, it has been suggested that Physical Education classes could be used to promote interventions that encourage adolescents to practice physical activity in their free time, and mobile applications could be used to monitor the activity carried out by adolescents, but also as an element that generates adherence and enjoyment in this population. Research in this population using these technologies is scarce, therefore, this project aims to determine the effectiveness of a ten-week intervention promoted from the subject of physical education in which a mobile application is used after school hours on physical activity, body composition and fitness in overweight or obese adolescents.",

      "detailedDescription": "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The SARS-CoV-2 is a \u03b2-coronavirus, which is enveloped non-segmented positive-sense RNA virus 2. It is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact, and infection has been estimated to have mean incubation period of 6.4 days and a basic reproduction number of 2.24-3.58. Among patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2, fever was the most common symptom, followed by cough. On 11 March 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was characterized as a pandemic by the WHO. Since then, over 70 million people worldwide have been infected with the virus with over 1.5 million deaths attributed to the virus. Laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 is currently being performed to determine if an individual has active infection via detection of viral RNA or if an individual has an immune response to the virus from a previous infection via detection of antibodies.\n\nSpecimen collection is a crucial first step in the evaluation of an individual's SARS-CoV-2 infection status. The goal of this project is to evaluate a rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen test for over the counter (OTC) use. Study subjects under EDP supervision, either in-person or via video conference, will collect and test anterior nasal swab samples and a Study Representative will collect and ship a second nasopharyngeal swab sample for comparator PCR testing. The Rapid SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test collection and testing methodology is viewed as a convenient and inexpensive method to test clinical specimens for SARS-CoV-2 and OTC access will improve the availability of COVD-19 testing.\n\nThe COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test Device detects SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens through visual interpretation of color development. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are immobilized on the test region of the nitrocellulose membrane. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies conjugated to colored particles are immobilized on the conjugated pad. A sample is added to the extraction buffer which is optimized to release the SARS-CoV-2 antigens from specimen. During testing, the extracted antigens bind to anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies conjugated to colored particles. As the specimen migrates along the strip by capillary action and interacts with reagents on the membrane, the complex will be captured by the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at the test region. Excess colored particles are captured at the internal control zone. The presence of a colored band in the test region indicates a positive result for the SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens, while its absence indicates a negative result. A colored band at the control region serves as a procedural control, indicating that the proper volume of specimen has been added and membrane wicking is working.",
      "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* The study population will include subjects from 2 years old to greater than 65 years old.\n* Lay subjects who perform the test on themselves must be able to read, write, speak, and understand English.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subjects less than 2 years old will be excluded.\n* Participants who regularly use home diagnostic tests, such as glucose meters, or are trained medical or laboratory professionals will be excluded.\n* Persons under 14 years of age will be excluded from performing the Rapid SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test on themselves.\n* Persons under 2 years of age will be excluded from participation.\n* Persons under 18 years of age will be excluded from performing the Rapid SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test on another qualified participant."

      "description": "Diaphragm is the principal muscle of inspiration. Diaphragmatic dysfunction is seen in many conditions including following intubation, lung disease, prolonged ventilation, neuromuscular disease, phrenic nerve injury. The possible mechanisms of diaphragmatic dysfunction in patients with COVID19 are critical illness myopathy, ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction, iatrogenic phrenic nerve injury particularly secondary to line placement, post-infectious inflammatory neuropathy of the phrenic nerve, or possibly direct neuromuscular involvement of the SARS- CoV-2 virus given expression of the angiotensin- converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in the peripheral nervous system and skeletal muscle. The use of diaphragmatic ultrasound has been widely used to assess diaphragmatic function is well known in patients following prolonged mechanical ventilation. Prolonged mechanical ventilation leads to contractile dysfunction of respiratory muscles, in particular the diaphragm, causing a so-called ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction. The latter is defined as a loss of diaphragm force-generating capacity specifically related to the use of mechanical ventilation. However, the use of diaphragmatic Ultrasound to assess its function in Long COVID patients has not been noted and is a gap in the work up of these patients.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to address Diaphragmatic Dysfunctional (DD) breathing seen in patients with Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), which results in shortness of breath/chest tightness and subsequent fatigue. Targeting shortness of breath and subsequent fatigue as a central symptom of PASC will alleviate long term sequelae for the patients with PASC. DD will be addressed by a unique intervention of physical therapy.

Measurement of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.\n\nSafety:\n\nThe following safety endpoints will be assessed:\n\n* Clinical laboratory assessments (hepatic function,)\n* All reports of AEs and SAEs Grade III and IV (CTC) with reasonable possibility of causal relationship to 5-ALA-Phosphate + SFC\n\nEfficacy:\n\nEfficacy will be assessing the immune system related T-helper cells and antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination for each subject.\n\nFrom day 0 onwards, all subjects keep a subject diary, which they fill out daily in order to record the dosage with the study treatment. Patients must meet the testing requirements on the day of the first vaccination (Day 0) and on the Day of the second vaccination and on Day 28 and on Follow-up visit.\n\nThe food supplement 5-Aminolevulinic acid phosphate and Sodium ferrous citrate (5-ALA-Phosphate + SFC) will be administered orally daily for 4 weeks at the following TOTAL daily doses:\n\nSubjects in the vaccination + ALA/SFC arm (Arm 1) will receive:\n\n\u2022 In total 3 capsules of 50 mg 5-ALA-Phosphate and 28.68 mg SFC (3.04 mg as Fe) per day, 2 capsules in the morning and 1 capsule in the evening resulting in 150 mg 5-ALA-Phosphate and 86.04 mg SFC ( 9.12 mg as Fe) total daily dose for 28 days\n\nHeme is critical for appropriate oxygen binding and delivery to remote site and without the heme contained within the hemoglobin tetramer, multicellular organisms would be unable to survive. Furthermore HO-1 degrades heme into biliverdin, carbon monoxide (CO), and iron, and biliverdin is immediately reduced and turned into bilirubin by biliverdin reductase. Biliverdin/bilirubin and CO both have anti-oxidative functions and they regulate important biological processes like inflammation, apoptosis, cell proliferation, fibrosis, and angiogenesis. Therefore, HO-1 is deemed to be a promising drug target (Ryter 2006). HO-1 is a major anti-inflammatory enzyme and a key regulator that induces immune tolerance.\n\n5-ALA-Phosphate + SFC increases heme metabolism and HO-1 via enhancement of porphyrin biology and utilizes the HO-1 for endothelial pacification strategy. Nishio reported 2014 that 5-aminolevulinic acid, a precursor of heme, in combination with divalent iron (SFC) is also able to induce HO-1 in vitro (Nishio 2014). This was attributed to the upregulation of heme synthesis and that 5-ALA+SFC transiently increased the intracellular heme amount through the phosphorylation of ERK / p38 and the nuclear translocation of a transcription factor Nrf2, as well as the depletion of a repressor protein BACH1 binding to the promoter site of HO-1. Similarly, Nakaso et al., 2003, Nishio et al., 2014, Ogawa et al., 2001, Saito et al., 2017 found that hemin administration promoted Nrf2 nuclear translocation and BACH1 dissociation leading to HO-1 induction.\n\nIto found in 2018 that the combination of 5-ALA 600 mg and sodium ferrous citrate (SFC) 942 mg upregulated HO-1 in PBMC at 8 h after administration while sole administration of 5-ALA or SFC was unable to induce HO-1. HO-1 in blood myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells was also upregulated by the combination of 5-ALA + SFC.\n\nIn summary the versatility of the administration of 5-ALA plus iron citrate (SFC) enables the body to counteract the inflammatory reactions that the virus induces in the endothelial system and multiple organs in the event of a virus attack by increasing the formation of HO-1.",

      "description": "The intensive care unit occupies a particular place in our health care system. The urgency of the clinical situations, the proportion of deaths encountered, and the daily workload is likely to generate suffering among staff. The health crisis linked to SARS-COV-2 is unprecedented and has leads to the unprecedented mobilisation of care providers, particularly in the ICU. Faced with the massive and growing influx of patients, human, therapeutic and material resources are overwhelmed and the teams are faced with an unusually heavy workload in a context of extreme tension. These professionals are thus exposed to a risk of over-investment, in a context of acute and repetitive stress, over an indeterminate period of time combining workload, emotional intensity with specific ethical issues, simultaneously affecting the professional sphere but also the personal and family sphere (confinement, risk of contamination). Now more than ever, the mental health of caregivers is an important concern, as highlighted by the CCNE. Mental health is understood in the way in which the individual responds specifically to work-related suffering by developing individual and collective defensive strategies. Thus, the issue of mental health in the ICU cannot be considered without taking into account the strategies that professionals put in place to combat stress and to contribute or not to the construction and stabilization of the work collective (collaboration, support). Ethical and/or psychological support systems have been set up in most of the establishments involved in the care of Covid-19 patients. However, the adequacy of these systems relative to the needs of professionals during and after the crisis is not yet known. We hypothesize that the psychological and social repercussions of this pandemic as well as the individual and collective strategies deployed by ICU care providers to deal with it will evolve in view of the progression of the crisis but also of the various types of support, particularly psychological and/or ethical, available to them.",

      "detailedDescription": "The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-infected disease (COVID-19) began in Wuhan, Hubei province in December 2019, spread throughout China in early 2020 and developed as a pandemic thereafter. Although the virus mainly causes respiratory symptoms, GI (gastrointestinal) presentations have been reported in and outside of China. Patients may present with anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal discomfort. Also, faecal-oral transmission of the virus is currently discussed. Preliminary, unpublished data from China suggest that patients with GI symptoms may suffer more frequently from severe courses of the disease. Clinical studies show an incidence rate of diarrhea ranging from 2% to 50% of cases. It may precede or trail respiratory symptoms. A pooled analysis revealed an overall percentage of diarrhea onset of 10.4%. SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cellular entry. ACE2 is expressed in the small intestinal epithelia as well as in the upper esophagus, liver, and colon. SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity to ACE2 is significantly higher (10-20 times) compared with SARS-CoV. Diarrhea is associated with prolonged symptoms and viral carriage.\n\nClinical information on the characteristics of Covid-19 diarrhea is scarce. The duration of diarrhea is around 4 days with 3-4 loose stools per day. Faecal calprotectin is elevated in stool of patients with Covid-19 diarrhea, indicating a relation between gastrointestinal symptoms and this well-established inflammation biomarker.\n\nSo far, no therapy is available for Covid-19 infection in general or for Covid-19 induced diarrhea. Rehydration and potassium monitoring should be performed as in all patients with diarrhea. It is important to underline that antivirals and antibiotics are often used for COVID-19 treatment or treatment of bacterial superinfections, involving a likely alteration of the gut microbiota and causing diarrhea. It is therefore plausible that the gut microbiota could be a new therapeutic target and that probiotics or synbiotics (combination of probiotics with prebiotics) could have a role in the management of these patients. The China's National Health Commission recommended the use of probiotics for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 in order to preserve intestinal balance and to prevent secondary bacterial infections without any available clinical studies to support this and probiotics apparently were used in Zhejiang during the Covid-19 pandemic. Although there is no specific data on the effects of probiotics on SARS-CoV2 infections, meta-analyses show that probiotics are effective in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections and viral gastroenteritis of other origins. Furthermore, Enterococcus faecium has been shown to have antiviral effects in enteropathogenic coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus infections in piglets. We therefore aim to assess the role of synbiotics in the therapy of Covid-19 infection with gastrointestinal symptoms.",

      "description": "For several years there has been interest in why some people with HIV-1 progress more slowly to disease and have longer survival without Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) than others. The investigators and others have identified a few HIV positive individuals who can control their viral load for many years without HAART, these rare individuals do not lose their HIV-1-specific cellular immune responses, which are very important for controlling viral load. This group is referred to as long-term non-progressors (LTNP). Unlike LTNP the majority of HIV-1 infected individuals are chronic progressors (CP) who do not make effective HIV-1-specific cellular immune responses, even when on HAART. We propose to use a novel DNA vaccine boosted with immune based therapy (cytokines and hormones) to try to regenerate the missing HIV-1-specific cellular immune responses to make chronically infected HIV-1+ persons more like LTNP.\n\nBy injecting this novel DNA vaccine and immune based therapy into the people who are already infected with HIV-1, the immune system may be stimulated to mount a greater immune response not only to the vaccines but also to real HIV-1 particles and HIV-1-infected cells.",
      "detailedDescription": "This will be a randomised, Phase I, open label comparative study running for 52 weeks (2 screen visits 2 weeks apart followed by 48 weeks of study). 50 patients will be screened in the initial phase of which 30 clade B infected individuals will be randomised into the study, which will consist of 3 arms:\n\nArm 1 will ascertain vaccine safety and toxicity in the presence of cytokine/hormone therapy.\n\nArm 2 will identify vaccine safety and toxicity.\n\nArm 3 will indicate safety and toxicity of cytokine/hormone therapy.\n\nThe target patients are chronically HIV-1 clade B infected persons who will have had a nadir CD4 T-cell count of \\>200 cells/ul blood before they started ART. The current CD4 T-cell count should be \\>400 cells/ul blood. Patients may have received ART for any length of time, but currently should be receiving NNRTI or boosted-PI based HAART, and have a viral load below the level of detection (50 copies/ml plasma). Patients will be bled on two occasions before commencing IBT regimens, in order to establish baselines, and then at regular intervals thereafter (weeks 0,1,2,4,6,8,12,16,24 and 48).\n\nThe treatment regimens are consistent with previous findings in animal models which suggest that administration of IL-2 during the antigen-specific T-cell contraction phase of an immune response (between 8 and 15 days post-vaccination) may preserve and lengthen clinically relevant responses. Furthermore studies in man have demonstrated that IL-2 administered before immunisation in ART-treated HIV-1-infected patients does not increase specific lymphoproliferation of T cells.\n\nRecent preliminary studies in HIV-1-infected individuals using tetanus vaccines the investigators have shown that IL-2 administered after immunisation may be more effective at inducing sustained tetanus-specific responses than IL-2 administered before immunisation or together with immunisation. The dosages used in this study are based on those used in previous pilot studies of the administration of IL-2 + GM-CSF and rhGH and at these levels the drugs have been shown to have both positive effect on the immune response and demonstrated clinical benefit whilst being at a level which is safe and well tolerated in HIV-1 positive individuals. The dosage of the vaccine was based on a previous study where a dosage of this level has been shown to induce an immune response although this response was transient. In summary the investigators aim to increase the survival of vaccine responses through the administration of cytokines/hormones and boost memory responses with further rounds of immunisation.",

Another goal is to see how effective this combination treatment is.",
      "detailedDescription": "Rationale: The purpose of this study is to combine PTK-787, a potent orally vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor inhibitor (in disorders where VEGF is known to be involved in the pathophysiology), with Imatinib mesylate (IM), a protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor of abl, Bcr-Abl, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), and c-Kit (in same disorders where these kinases are believed to be important). The potential synergy between oral agents that inhibit these kinases in disorders where each of the two agents have some, but inadequate, single agent activity is being studied in this protocol. We will also have an opportunity to assess if there is any correlation between response and individual kinase mutations e.g., c-Kit in patients with AML. If improved outcomes are observed, further studies will be indicated to investigate which, if either, agent is predominantly responsible for such a benefit - these studies will be facilitated by the availability of more potent e.g., (AMN107 as an abl inhibitor), (Bevacizumab, AG013736 as VEGF inhibitors) agents which will help to define the relative importance of the various inhibitory activities.\n\nObjectives: To determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of PTK 787 and imatinib mesylate, when given in combination to patients with refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (AMM) and chronic myelogenous leukemia in blastic phase (CML-BP).\n\nTo determine the efficacy (response rate, survival, time to progression, time to treatment failure, duration of response) of the MTD in these study populations.",

For this reason and because inhibitors of mRNA translation are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier method of birth control; abstinence) for the duration of study participation.\n* Due to possible interactions with study drugs, oral contraceptives should not be used. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

      "description": "This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of ribociclib, tucatinib, and trastuzumab for the treatment of HER2 positive breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic), and then compares the effect of ribociclib, tucatinib, trastuzumab with or without fulvestrant to docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab (standard of care) for the treatment of early stage breast cancer before surgery (neoadjuvant therapy). Ribociclib and tucatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Trastuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches itself to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of tumor cells, known as HER2 receptors. When trastuzumab attaches to HER2 receptors, the signals that tell the cells to grow are blocked and the tumor cell may be marked for destruction by the body's immune system. Pertuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast tumor cells. Fulvestrant blocks the use of estrogen by the tumor cells. Chemotherapy drugs, such as docetaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving ribociclib, tucatinib, and trastuzumab with or without fulvestrant before surgery may make the tumor smaller and may reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.",

      "description": "RATIONALE: Vaccines made from gene-modified cells and a person's cancer cells may make the body build an effective immune response to kill cancer cells. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) may stimulate the white blood cells to kill cancer cells. Giving booster vaccinations may make a stronger immune response and prevent or delay the recurrence of cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more cancer cells. Giving vaccine therapy together with IL-2 after combination chemotherapy may be a more effective treatment for mantle cell lymphoma.\n\nPURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving vaccine therapy together with IL-2 after combination chemotherapy works in treating patients with relapsed or de novo stage II, stage III, or stage IV mantle cell lymphoma.",
      "detailedDescription": "Patients were treated with 3-6 cycles of chemotherapy +/- rituximab, with type and duration at the discretion of the individual clinician. Evaluation for response was performed 1 month after completing chemotherapy, and included computed tomography (CT) scan, bone marrow biopsy, endoscopy, and colonoscopy. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed qualitatively on bone marrow specimens using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with standardized primers for evaluation for B-cell receptor gene rearrangement. Responses were defined according to revised Cheson criteria. Patients with successful lymph node harvest who had obtained complete or partial response could proceed to bystander vaccination.\n\nThe GM.CD40L bystander vaccine administered intradermally into the bilateral axillary and inguinal nodal basins via eight separate injections (0.125 ml / injection). Low dose IL-2 (0.5 x 10\\^6 units) was given subcutaneously twice daily for 14 days following vaccination. Patients were restaged with CT and/or CT/PET and bone marrow biopsy every 6 months, beginning from the last date of chemotherapy. Follow-up bone marrow biopsy evaluation included an assessment for MRD as described above. Patients without disease progression or toxicity attributable to the vaccine were eligible for 4 monthly booster vaccines at 12 months and 24 months.",

      "description": "Urticaria is a very frequent skin condition characterised by transient wheal and flare type skin reactions associated with severe pruritus. Cold contact urticaria (CCU) is a frequent form of physical urticaria that is characterized by the development of wheal and flare type skin reactions due to the release of histamine and other proinflammatory mast cell mediators following exposure of the skin to cold. Among all physical urticaria subtypes the frequency of CCU varies between 5.7% and 33.8% in different studies. Physical urticarias including CCU are known to severely impair the quality of life of affected patients.\n\nThe treatment of choice in CCU, as well as in other inducible forms and spontaneous urticaria, are non-sedating H1 antihistamines. Recent data have shown that updosing of H1 blockers is significantly more effective in reducing symptoms in cold urticaria than standard-dose treatment. Thus, patients who cannot be sufficiently controlled with standard-dose antihistamines should receive high-dose H1 blockers up to 4 times the standard dose as recommended by the new international guidelines for the management of urticaria.\n\nPrevious phase II studies in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria have shown favorable results for the treatment with omalizumab (Xolair\u00ae). Proof-of-concept data from completed studies suggest that omalizumab improves urticaria in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria who have failed treatment with H1 antihistamines as well as those who have failed treatment with a combination of H1 and H2 antihistamines and a leukotriene receptor antagonist. In addition, two case reports of patients with severe therapy refractory CCU treated with omalizumab reported a complete response with no urticarial symptoms after cold challenge. In summary, these data suggest that omalizumab may have a beneficial effect in the treatment of CCU.",

      "description": "This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of dovitinib lactate when given together with gemcitabine hydrochloride and capecitabine in treating patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors or advanced pancreatic cancer. Dovitinib lactate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride and capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving dovitinib lactate together with combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells",

      "detailedDescription": "Long term survivors of childhood cancer, are a distinct group requiring specific follow-up in order to enhance their quality of life. Studies have shown that many of these patients will go on to develop chronic issues within different organ systems. Because of the iron burden of the frequent transfusions required to care for these patients, iron overload may indeed be one of the problems these survivors potentially face. Research primarily in thalassemia and bone marrow transplant patients who were extensively transfused has shown that iron overload can have a significant impact on their overall health. Complications from increased iron burden can include growth retardation, gonadal dysfunction, hypothyroidism, impaired glucose metabolism, cardiac arrhythmias and failure, hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis, and increased susceptibility to infections. However all of these conditions related to iron overload can be prevented with the use of either phlebotomy or chelation therapy. Based on this knowledge, our objective is to determine if pediatric oncology and transplant patients heavily supported with transfusions develop consequential biochemical and clinical evidence of iron overload.",

      "detailedDescription": "Patients treated with targeted therapies by tyrosine kinase inhibition (TKI) almost always show different response patterns than tumors treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Tumor manifestations treated with targeted therapies often show only minor measurable changes in tumor size despite inhibition of tumor proliferation. Decrease in tumor size fulfilling the criteria of a partial remission according to RECIST may occur at a delayed stage of treatment after several months (PMID 19620483). Sometimes, even an initial increase of maximum tumor diameters may be observed although those patients are treatment responders with respect to 'hard' study endpoints like overall survival or progression free survival. As a result, patients often are misclassified too early as non-responders. As a consequence, successful treatment is not recognized or decisions towards a less effective second-line therapy are made.\n\nDual Energy CT (DECT) is a new and robust CT method that allows to exactly quantify the intra-tumoral amount of intravenously injected iodinated contrast material PMID 21822784). Thus, the technique can be considered as a simple and reliable surrogate of tumor Perfusion (PMID 21822784, 21934517, 20498609, 18677487). Initial studies have demonstrated a high accuracy of DECT in the differentiation of benign and malignant tumors in the kidney or lung (PMID 20498609, 18677487, 18796658). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the amount of iodine in lung tumors correlates with tumor glucose metabolism (PMID 21822784). These findings confirm the results of previous studies that have demonstrated the relationship between tumor perfusion, tumor microvessel density and glucose metabolism (PMID 15304661).\n\nThe hypothesis of the study is that DECT is the more accurate diagnostic tool to evaluate immediate therapeutic response in patients with GIST undergoing TKI inhibitor therapy (in most cases Glivec \u00ae) than evaluating by RECIST, World Health Organization (WHO) and Choi criteria.",

      "detailedDescription": "Participants were randomized to ligelizumab 240 mg, ligelizumab 120 mg, or placebo (5 treatment arms, randomization ratio of 2:2:2:2:1) for the double-blind placebo-controlled treatment period (up to Week 12).\n\nParticipants initially assigned to the 8-week placebo arms received the first dose of blinded ligelizumab treatment at the Week 8 visit. Participants initially assigned to the 16-week placebo arm received the last dose of placebo before the Double Blind Placebo Controlled Food Challenge (DBPCFC) at Week 12 and the first dose of blinded ligelizumab treatment at the Week 16 visit.\n\nAt the start of the study, recruitment was restricted to 12-55-year-old participants. After approximately 60 adolescent participants (defined as 12-17 yrs of age) had completed all Week 12 assessments, an interim analysis (IA1) on Pharmacokinetics (PK) and selected Pharmacodynamics (PD) data (total IgE and basophil bound High affinity immunoglobulin E receptor 1 (Fc\u0190RI)) was performed (safety was reviewed by a Data Monitoring Committee - DMC). Independent sponsor members who were responsible for PK/ PD data analysis and Modeling \\& Simulation were unblinded to the results of this interim analysis. The planned intent of this analysis was to confirm the dosing strategy for the youngest age group, 6-11 yrs and once the dose was to be confirmed, recruitment was supposed to be open for this age group. However, Novartis made a strategic decision to close recruitment in the study CQGE031G12301 and to terminate the study early, once all eligible participants in the study had completed week 12 assessments and the 16-week safety follow-up period. This decision was based on a blinded data review, which showed evidence of efficacy without the detection of any safety signal and that efficacy may be optimized with a different dosing regimen. Due to this decision, the final population size was 211, with only adolescent and adult participants (12 - 17yrs, and 18 - 55yrs) recruited.",

      "detailedDescription": "Recently, improved understanding of the incretin effect on the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes has led to development of new agent for hypoglycemic therapy. Vildagliptin is a potent and highly selective dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor that augments the active glucagon-like peptide(GLP)-1 concentration, increases insulin secretion and improves glucose tolerance. Vildagliptin has a similar glucose lowering effect, but lower hypoglycemic events, as compared to glimepiride. Vildagliptin could improve not only the mean glycemic control but also 24 hour glycemic fluctuation by restoring the physiologic pattern of insulin and glucagon secretion. Furthermore, decreased postprandial glycemic excursion might reduce the oxidative stress markers and improve endothelial dysfunction. Those effects might be amplified in Asian patients because of prominent early phase insulin secretory defects accompanied with relatively less degree of insulin resistance. In addition, GLP-1 and GLP-1 analogues exert direct beneficial effects on endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. Therefore DPP-4 inhibitors may directly improve endothelial dysfunction.\n\nBased on this assumption, this research will focus on the effect of vildagliptin on glycemic variability, oxidative stress markers and endothelial cell function compared to long acting sulfonylurea glimepiride in type 2 diabetic patients with inadequate glycemic control on metformin.",

Observe the incidence of local and distant recurrences.",
      "detailedDescription": "THE STUDY DRUG:\n\nLetrozole is designed to block the enzyme that makes estrogen in post-menopausal women. By interfering with the production of estrogen made by the enzyme, letrozole decreases the total amount of estrogen in the body. As a result, less estrogen can reach cancer cells, which may prevent their growth.\n\nSCREENING TESTS:\n\nBefore you can begin taking the study drug on this study, you will have \"screening tests\" to help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this study. The following tests and procedures will be performed:\n\n* Your complete medical history will be recorded.\n* You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam and measurement of your vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate).\n* Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to test for tumor markers.\n* You will have a chest x-ray and a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to check the status of the disease.\n* Your previously collected tumor tissue, if available, will be tested to learn if the estrogen receptor is positive or negative.\n* You will be asked how well you are able to perform the normal activities of daily living (performance status evaluation).\n\nSTUDY GROUPS:\n\nIf you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. Group 1 will take letrozole. Group 2 will take a placebo. A placebo is a substance that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredients. Neither the doctor nor you will know which group you will be in. However, if needed for your safety, the study staff and study doctor will be able to find out which group you are in.\n\nSTUDY DRUG ADMINISTRATION:\n\nYou will take letrozole or the placebo by mouth 1 time every day of each 12-week study \"cycle\". It should be taken around the same time every day and can be taken with or without food and/or water. You will be given the amount of study drug/placebo needed for 1 cycle of therapy at a time.\n\nYou will keep a drug \"diary\" during the study. In this diary you will list when and how much study drug/placebo you took. This diary will be reviewed after each cycle.\n\nSTUDY VISITS:\n\nWithin 4 weeks before your first dose of study drug/placebo, you will have a bone scan to test your bones and to watch for any signs of osteoporosis (weakened bones) that can be caused by decreased estrogen levels. You will be separately consented for this bone scan, which will describe the procedure and its risks in detail.\n\nEvery 12 weeks, the following tests and procedures will be performed:\n\n* Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to test for tumor markers.\n* You will have a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the status of the disease.\n* You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam and measurement of your vital signs and weight.\n* You will have a performance status evaluation.\n* You will be asked if you have experienced any side effects.\n\nEvery 6 months, you will have a chest x-ray.\n\nEvery year, you will have a bone scan to check for osteoporosis.\n\nLENGTH OF STUDY:\n\nYou may remain on the study for as long as you are not experiencing intolerable side effects and the disease has not gotten worse.

      "detailedDescription": "Due to highly effective antiretroviral therapy, people living with HIV (PLWH) in Switzerland have a close-to-normal life expectancy. Among PLWH, there has been a shift of focus from HIV-related health issues to non communicable diseases, especially cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and cancer. Smoking, a prominent risk factor for both diseases, takes a key role in view of the high number of smokers among PLWH.\n\nNew approaches to smoking cessation focus on harm reduction by substituting tobacco cigarettes by less harmful alternatives. Conventional nicotine replacement therapy like nicotine patches is well established and effective against withdrawal symptoms after quitting. However, these products are exceptionally expensive and the missing \"nicotine hit\" often limits therapy adherence. The long-term abstinence rate remains low. Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and nicotine pouches as alternative nicotine replacement therapies have the potential to overcome these problems and are accessible.\n\nE-cigarettes play a growing role in smoking cessation therapy. Evidence from randomized trials shows superiority over conventional nicotine replacement therapies, which is probably based on the better imitation of the smoking experience. Although e-cigarettes are not without concerns, there is consensus that they are significantly less harmful than tobacco cigarettes.\n\nTobacco-free nicotine pouches, delivering nicotine through oral mucosa, are a relatively novel option for nicotine substitution. Similar to e-cigarettes, nicotine pouches are relatively affordable and can address the limitation of poor imitation of the \"nicotine hit\" seen with traditional nicotine replacement therapy. To the best of our knowledge, no trials have investigated the potential of nicotine pouches for smoking cessation so far.\n\nWith this trial, the investigators also want to address frequent shortcomings of smoking cessation trials, such as restrictive inclusion criteria and highly controlled interventions, by RETUNE Version 1.1, January 06, 2025 10/45 offering a menu of different tobacco smoking substitutional products (e-cigarettes or nicotine pouches or nicotine patches) and by using a novel pragmatic trial design, the Trials within Cohorts (TwiCs) design. The investigators plan to recruit tobacco smokers in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS), regardless of their willingness to quit. This so called \"opt-out-approach\" has been suggested as a new promising approach for smoking cessation trials to increase generalizability of the results. The TwiCs design optimally allows to implement and evaluate the \"opt-out\" approach embedded in the SHCS.",

Similar drugs in this class are increasingly used in organ transplantation and in autoimmune diseases. With the established safety profile of myfortic \u00ae in allo-transplantation and the already existing data of mycophenolate mofetil in autoimmune diseases, this study should help to demonstrate the beneficial effect of myfortic \u00ae on lupus activity. The aim of the study will be to show a decreased disease activity with myfortic \u00ae compared to standard maintenance therapy with azathioprine.",
      "detailedDescription": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex and potentially life-threatening disease that affects about 40 per 10,000 people in the general population (Mills 1994, Brown \\& Schrieber 1996). SLE is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by auto-antibody overproduction and other distinct immunological abnormalities (Boumpas, et al 1995, Mohan \\& Datta 1995). It may affect the skin, joints, lungs, heart, serous membranes, nervous system or other organs. Improvements in treatment over the last decade have increased 10-year survival rates in Western countries to 90% or more, and 20-year survival rates of nearly 70% have also been reported (Abu-Shakra, et al 1995).\n\nNewer treatment strategies include the use of novel immunosuppressive agents, such as mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). MMF has been widely used in solid-organ transplantation (Sollinger 1995, The Tricontinental Mycophenolate Mofetil Renal Transplantation Study Group 1996). MMF also has been used increasingly in autoimmune diseases (e.g., dermatomyositis, primary glomerular disease or psoriasis (Epinette, et al 1987, Gelber, et al 2000, Choi, et al 2002)).\n\nMMF is the morpholinoethylester prodrug of mycophenolic acid (MPA). After oral administration MMF is well absorbed and rapidly hydrolyzed to MPA. MPA is a noncompetitive inhibitor of inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase (DH). Inhibition of IMPDH leads to the depletion of deoxyguanosine triphosphate and a consequent decrease in the level of substrate required for DNA polymerase activity. This results in inhibition of DNA production and cell proliferation. T and B cells are more dependent on this de novo pathway of purine synthesis because alternative salvage pathways are unavailable. Thus, MPA is a selective inhibitor of lymphocyte proliferation, especially in activated lymphocytes (Allison \\& Eugui 2000).\n\nA limited number of clinical studies have been performed to study the efficacy of MMF in the treatment of SLE. Most of these studies involved the treatment of nephritis. Chan, et al (2000) showed that the combination of MMF and prednisolone is as effective as a regimen of cyclophosphamide and prednisolone followed by azathioprine and prednisolone. Azathioprine and MMF as maintenance therapy were compared to cyclophosphamide therapy (Contreras, et al 2004) and appeared to be more efficacious and safer than long-term therapy with i.v. cyclophosphamide. In this study, it was also noted that patients treated with MMF had received lower doses of corticosteroids during maintenance therapy as compared to patients treated with azathioprine.\n\nRecent reports suggest that MMF may also be effective in systemic lupus without severe renal involvement.(Pisoni, et al 2005) Yet, the superiority over azathioprine in this patient group has not been established. Own observations show that approximately 50% of patients with SLE treated with azathioprine have at least some evidence of lupus activity. The aim of this study will be to show a decreased lupus activity in patients treated with myfortic \u00ae compared to therapy with azathioprine. Data so gathered may be useful in planning future developments in this indication\n\nThis is a 12 months, multi-center, 2-treatment arm, parallel-group, randomized, open label study in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus currently on azathioprine. The patients will be randomized to one of the following two treatment groups:\n\n* Maintenance of previous therapy including azathioprine.\n* Switch to a myfortic \u00ae based regimen: myfortic \u00ae (dose of 1440mg/day) A total of 48 patients (24 patients per arm) fulfilling the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study from approximately 5 centers in the Netherlands. Screening evaluations and assessments will be performed in the period after informed consent has been signed by the patient and before randomization of the patient (Baseline, Day 1). Visits are scheduled for Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 12, Months 6, 9 and 12.\n\nThe final analysis will be performed after the last patient has reached the 12 months of the study.\n\nThe following efficacy variables will be obtained and recorded:\n\n* Disease activity index measured with SLEDAI\n* Disease activity index measured with BILAG (numerical score)\n* (Average) daily dose of prednisone (mg/kg/day). The dose will be measured from the patient starting the study and for the whole duration of the study.\n* Damage index measured with SLICC/ACR\n* Serum creatinine\n* Creatinine clearance\n* Urine protein:creatinine ratio",

      "detailedDescription": "Phase I:\n\nThe Study Drugs:\n\nBoth panobinostat and everolimus are designed to block cancer cells from multiplying. Everolimus may also stop the growth of new blood vessels that help tumor growth. As a result, the cancer cells may grow more slowly or die.\n\nStudy Groups:\n\nIf you are found to be eligible to take part in this phase of the study, you will be assigned to a study group based on when you joined this study. Up to 5 groups of 3-6 participants will be enrolled in this phase of the study.\n\nIf you are enrolled in this phase of the study, the dose of study drugs you receive will depend on when you joined this study. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level of the study drugs. Each new group may receive a higher dose of study drugs than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue for up to 5 combinations of the study drugs, until the highest tolerable dose of study drugs in combination is found.\n\nUp to 2 dose levels of everolimus and up to 4 dose levels of panobinostat will be tested in this phase of the study. This is up to 5 different dose combinations of everolimus and panobinostat. (The dose of both drugs does not get raised in every dose level, but sometimes only 1 drug's dose gets raised.)\n\nStudy Drug Administration:\n\nPanobinostat:\n\nYou will take panobinostat by mouth 3 times a week during each cycle. Cycles in this study are 28 days long.\n\nYou should take panobinostat with 1 cup (8 ounces) of water at about the same time each day that you take it.\n\nIf you miss a dose of panobinostat, take it as soon as you remember it on the same day. However, if more than 12 hours have passed since you were supposed to take the dose, you should skip that day's dose. In that case, wait to take panobinostat until the next scheduled treatment day.\n\nEverolimus:\n\nYou will take everolimus every day, at about the same time in the morning. You will take it by mouth with 1 cup (8 ounces) of water. You should take everolimus either with no food or drink except water (\"fasting\") or with no more than a light, fat-free meal.\n\nExamples of light, fat-free meals include cereal with fat-free milk, a fat-free muffin, toast, a bagel with fat-free spread, or fruit salad.\n\nThe reason to avoid high-fat breakfasts while you are taking everolimus is to help the drug get absorbed better by your body.\n\nIf you experience intolerable side effects, you must call your doctor right away. The doctor may then lower the dose of study drug or take you off study.\n\nYou should not consume grapefruit products or Seville (sour) oranges while you are on study, because they may interact with everolimus.\n\nStudy Visits:\n\nWithin 7 days before the first dose of study drug:\n\n* You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking.\n* Blood (about 2 1/2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.\n* Women who are able to become pregnant will have a blood (about 1 tablespoon) pregnancy test.\n\nOn Day 1 of Cycle 1:\n\n* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.\n* You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects that may have occurred.\n* Your performance status will be recorded.\n* Blood (about 2 1/2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n* Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for biomarker research.\n* If your doctor thinks it is needed, urine will be collected for routine tests.\n* Women who are able to become pregnant will have a blood (about 1 tablespoon) pregnancy test.\n\nOn Days 1 and 5 of Cycle 1, you will have an ECG.\n\nOn Weeks 2, 3, and 4 of Cycle 1, blood (about 2 1/2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\nOn Week 2 of Cycle 1, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for biomarker research.\n\nOn Day 1 of Cycle 2 and every cycle after that:\n\n* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.\n* You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects that may have occurred.\n* Your performance status will be recorded.\n* You will have an ECG (or more than 1 ECG if the doctor thinks it is needed).\n* Blood (about 2 1/2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n* Women who are able to become pregnant will have a blood (about 1 tablespoon) pregnancy test.\n\nEvery 8 weeks:\n\n* You will have a PET scan to check the status of the disease.\n* You will have a CT scan of your head and neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the status of the disease.\n\nLength of Study:\n\nIf you show benefit from taking the study drugs, you may receive up to 6 cycles. You will be taken off study if you have intolerable side effects or the disease gets worse.\n\nEnd-of-Treatment Visit:\n\nAfter you stop taking the study drugs, you will return to the clinic for an end-of-treatment visit:\n\n* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.\n* Your performance status will be recorded.\n* You will have an ECG.\n* You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking.\n* Blood (about 3 1/2 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests.\n* You will have a PET scan to check the status of the disease.\n* You will have a computed tomography (CT) scan of your head and neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the status of the disease.\n* If your doctor thinks it is needed, urine will be collected for routine tests.\n* If the doctor thinks the disease has responded completely, you will have a bone marrow biopsy and aspiration to confirm the complete response. To collect a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate, an area of the hip is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow and bone is withdrawn through a large needle.\n* Women who are able to become pregnant will have a blood (about 1 tablespoon) pregnancy test.\n\nThis is an investigational study. Panobinostat is not FDA approved or commercially available. At this time the drug is being used in research only. Everolimus is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. Using everolimus in combination with panobinostat in patients with lymphoma is investigational.\n\nUp to 18 patients will take part in this phase of this study.

      "description": "RBC transfusion (RBCT) after kidney transplantation(KT) is about 50%. Anemia is common after kidney transplant surgery due to intraoperative blood loss, delayed graft function, and side effects of immunosuppressive drugs. However, due to exposure to non-self human leukocyte antigens (HLA) from blood transfusion, there is a risk of sensitization to HLA through the production of anti-HLA antibodies. In renal transplant patients, exposure to non-self HLA antigens due to RBCT can lead to the generation of donor-specific antibodies (DSA) against renal allograft donors. Patients who have undergone KT are frequently exposed to RBCT, and immunologic damage resulting from this can be an important cause of loss of graft kidney function. Therefore, there should be a more careful review of the risk associated with RBCT on KT recipients.\n\nOf the 16,191 Koreans who underwent KT between 2008 and 2017, 59.7% received transplant-related blood transfusions. As a result of analyzing 13,871 Koreans who underwent KT between 2007 and 2015, the overall graft failure rate was 15.5%, and the hazard ratio of survival rate according to RBCT before and after KT increased as the amount of transfusion increased. RBCT before and after KT was independently associated with graft failure and death. Therefore, research on treatment methods that can effectively reduce blood transfusion in transplant patients is absolutely necessary. About 30-60% of patients undergoing major surgery show preoperative anemia, which causes blood transfusions, complications during hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, and delayed recovery. The most common cause of anemia is iron deficiency. In particular, an increase in hepcidin, a major regulator of iron metabolism, reduces intestinal iron absorption and promotes iron sequestering by macrophages, resulting in a state of functional iron deficiency. Therefore, oral iron intake as a treatment for anemia in surgical patients is not effective. Although the safety and clinical superiority of high-dose intravenous iron therapy have been demonstrated in patients with chronic renal failure, the effect of this drug on blood transfusion of pre- and post-kidney transplant surgery has not been studied. Therefore, this study aims to verify the effectiveness and stability of the combined administration of intravenous(IV) iron and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents(ESA) before and after KT for patients who perform KT for end-stage kidney disease(ESKD). The investigators will analyze hemoglobin, transferrin saturation, ferritin changes, and transfusion requirements according to the combined administration of IV iron and ESA before and after surgery of kidney transplant patients. Also, the investigators evaluate whether a treatment combining IV iron and ESA will be possible as an alternative blood transfusion treatment and its effect on the clinical prognosis of KT recipients. In particular, the effect on the function of the graft kidney, immunological outcomes-DSA, antibody-mediated rejection, and survival rate will be analyzed. Also, the investigators will analyze the change in expression of hepcidin and oxidative stress markers before and after kidney transplantation and the mechanism of expression according to the combined administration of IV iron and ESA. This study is a multicenter(including 3 centers), open-label, prospective, and randomized clinical trial. 302 patients undergoing living-donor KT for ESKD are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to an experimental group actively using IV iron and ESA, and a control group receiving conventional anemia treatment for 42 months from the time of IRB approval. Participants selected for the experimental group will be given a total of 1000 mg of IV Monofer(iron isomaltoside); each 200 mg dose on 28, 21, and 7 days before kidney transplantation, on the day of surgery, and 7 days after surgery. In the case of ESA, it is freely used according to the criteria up to 7 days before transplantation and subcutaneously injected with 120 mcg of Mircera(methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta) between 7 days before surgery and a day before surgery. In the control group, IV Monofer is administered only 28 days before surgery according to the set criteria.

      "description": "This study aims to compare the volume management methods performed by using conventional method and PVI monitoring in intraoperative fluid treatment during bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and total hysterectomy operation.",
      "detailedDescription": "Intraoperative fluid management is very important in terms of postoperative organ perfusion and complications. While various complications such as acute renal failure, hypotension, arrhythmia, anastomotic leakage can be seen due to intraoperative hypovolemia; Hypervolemia can cause pulmonary edema, postoperative pneumonia, prolonged mechanical ventilation need, delayed wound healing, gastrointestinal system (GIS) edema and decreased intestinal motility.\n\nIncreasing the quality of intraoperative fluid therapy is a situation that may affect the morbidity and mortality of patients due to all these reasons.\n\nConventional fluid management is widely used in clinical practice. In this method, the fluid need of the patient is decided according to pulse, arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, urine output and clinical condition. In the targeted fluid therapy method, besides static parameters such as pulse, arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure; Dynamic parameters such as Stroke volume variability (SVV), pulse pressure variability (PPV), pleth variability index (PVI), continuous hemoglobin (SpHb) are also used noninvasively. Studies related to SpHb, which provides noninvasive continuous hemoglobin monitoring in accordance with pulse oximetry, show that there is a decrease in blood product transfusion compared to cases managed with conventional laboratory follow-up.\n\nOur primary goal is to compare the control group (conventional fluid management) with the PVI group (Pleth Variability Index and SpHb guided targeted fluid management) protocol.\n\nFor this purpose, we aim to compare the amount of crystalloids and blood products, blood lactate, serum creatinine and electrolyte levels applied in the intraoperative period as a result of both protocols. Our secondary aim will be to compare the length of stay in the hospital.\n\nThe study is planned as a single center, prospective, randomized controlled clinical study. It was aimed to evaluate fluid therapy during elective total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingooferectomy operation. Before the operation, patients will be divided into 2 groups randomly. For randomization, the automatic system on the randomization.com website will be used. All patients included in the study will be premedicated with 1mg of midazolam after monitoring with pulse, non-invasive blood pressure, oxygen saturation. Then, invasive arterial cannulation will be applied and continuous blood pressure monitoring will be done. In the PVI group, non-invasive PVI and SpHb monitoring will also be performed from the other upper extremity without arterial cannulation. After two minutes of preoxygenation, anesthesia induction will be started. Anesthesia induction doses used routinely in our clinic include iv 2 mg / kg propofol, 0.6 mg / kg rocuronium and 2 \u03bcg / kg fentanyl. Sevoflurane will be administered by inhalation during anesthesia maintenance after tracheal intubation. Initially, all patients will be given 250 ml intravenous crystalloid. Then 8-10 ml / kg / hour iv fluid maintenance will be started for the control group. If the mean arterial pressure (MAP) is \\<65 mmHg or the decrease in MAP is more than 20%, 250 ml iv colloid will be applied. If the decrease in MAP continues despite the colloid bolus or if the MAP is below 65 mmHg, noradrenaline infusion will be started. Patients in the PVI group will be started on maintenance fluid therapy at 2-3 ml / kg / hour. In addition to standard monitoring, if PVI is \\<13% and OAB\u226565mmHg in measurements made with PVI, current fluid therapy will continue. If PVI is \\<13% and MAP \\<65 mmHg, noradrenaline infusion will be started. If PVI is\\> 13% and OAB\u226565 mmHg, 250 ml iv colloid bolus will be administered, and iv colloid bolus will be continued until the PVI is \\<13% in the 5-minute follow-ups. If PVI\\> 13% and MAP \\<65 mmHg, patients should receive 250 ml i.v. colloid infusion will be given, if MAP \\<65mmHg continues in 5 minutes follow-up, 250 ml i.v. Colloid and noradrenaline infusion will be started and repeated until the OAB\u226565 mmHg and PVI \\<13%. The decision to transfuse in both groups will be taken under the guidance of the European Society of Anesthesia (ESA) perioperative bleeding management guidelines. In the control group, hemorrhage will be monitored with laboratory Hb values, while SpHb and laboratory Hb values will be evaluated together in the PVI group.\n\nPatients in the ASA1-2-3 risk group who will undergo elective total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy under general anesthesia, between the ages of 18-65, will be included in this study. The study will be conducted with 80 people.\n\nIn both groups, continuous arterial blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation and arterial blood gas, lactate concentration at hourly intervals, hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chlorine values, hospital stay, hourly intervals, intraoperative hourly and postoperatively 24 hours later, The amount of crystalloids and blood products used intraoperatively, postoperative volume dependent complications and their frequency will be evaluated.\n\nThe study will be conducted by anesthesiologists in the operating rooms located in the central campus of our hospital.",

Open radical retropubic prostatectomy was pioneered in 1947 by Millin but what was slow to gain widespread acceptance secondary to associated morbidity.9-13 Refinement of the retropubic approach by Walsh has greatly improved outcomes, making it the most common surgical approach for radical prostatectomy.14, 15\n\nAs with other procedures, interest in the laparoscopic approach for radical prostatectomy developed in hopes of minimizing patient morbidity. In 1992, Schuessler et al performed the first LRP but the technical difficulties of the procedure at that time prohibited the widespread application of this technique.16 In 1998, Guillonneau et al introduced the Mountsouris technique in which a transperitoneal approach was used to perform the LRP.17, 18 Other groups have used this approach and even adapted this technique to perform extraperitoneal approaches to LRP.1, 2, 4, 5, 19, 20 Many centers are currently offering LRP as primary therapy for organ confined prostate cancer.\n\nAll curative surgical therapies for prostate cancer, whether performed in an open or laparoscopic manner, can result in impotence and/or incontinence. Incontinence can be treated with simple measures, such as muscle strengthening exercises, or if more bothersome, can be treated with surgical therapy. Impotence can be treated with medications or, if needed, surgery.\n\nThe relative risk of having positive surgical margins in patients undergoing open radical retropubic prostatectomy compared to laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is not known. Preliminary publications regarding laparoscopic radical prostatectomy report rates of positive surgical margins (13-25%) that are similar to open radical prostatectomy (11-46%).2, 5, 6, 19, 21-28 However, long-term follow-up is not available for patients undergoing laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, so the impact of positive margins on long-term survival is not known.",

Participants will perform taVNS 5 minutes a day for 6 months total, monitoring for signs of nephrotic syndrome relapse with both labwork and clinical symptoms.",
      "detailedDescription": "Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome is defined as the development of proteinuria, edema, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperlipidemia often presenting in the pediatric population. The underlying pathogenesis of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome is poorly understood but likely involves dysregulation of the immune system, and the majority of patients respond to steroid therapy and other immunosuppressive therapy. Unfortunately, relapses are common, with at least one relapse occurring in up to 90% of patients. Frequently-relapsing patients may be exposed large amounts of steroids and other immunosuppressants with a multitude of adverse effects, while others may not even respond to these treatments. Therefore, novel therapies are being studied.\n\nVagus nerve stimulation is a novel therapy with the potential to treat inflammatory conditions via inhibition of cytokine release by the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. The purpose of the proposed study is to investigate the use of vagus nerve stimulation in the prevention of nephrotic syndrome relapses and treatment of proteinuria in pediatric patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome.\n\nPatients will be enrolled if they have frequently-relapsing idiopathic nephrotic syndrome or proteinuria which does not respond to steroid therapy. These patients will perform daily transcutaneous auricular Vagus Nerve stimulation (taVNS) therapy 5 minutes a day for a 6 month period and will be monitored for urine/bloodwork or clinical signs of nephrotic syndrome relapse.",

      "detailedDescription": "Urinary tract infection is a common infectious disease in clinic. Urinary tract infection is easily caused by abnormal structure and function of urinary system, low immunity, pregnancy, gender and sexual activity, and iatrogenic factors. Urinary tract infection has a wide spectrum of pathogenic microorganisms, including Gram-negative bacilli, Gram-positive cocci, fungi, mycoplasma, chlamydia, viruses and so on. Although urinary tract infection can be initially diagnosed by clinical sign and symptom, signs and urine routine, the application of appropriate antibiotic therapy depends on the further identification of pathogens. At present, it is commonly used to collect midstream urine for pathogen culture in clinic, but it has the disadvantages of time-consuming and low detection rate, and the use of antibiotics can affect the results of culture.\n\nMetagenomic sequencing has been widely used in clinical pathogen diagnosis, especially in difficult infectious diseases. Its principle is to collect samples, use mNGS to process the samples before sequencing, expose the nucleic acid, compare the nucleic acid sequence of pathogens with the designated huge biological database, and realize the comprehensive detection of viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites and atypical microorganisms. Compared with tissue samples, cerebrospinal fluid, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, whole blood and other samples, the application of mNGS in urine samples is relatively limited because incorrect sampling methods before and after collection of urine samples are easy to contaminate the samples and the colonization of distal urethra, periurethral skin and vagina will interfere with the interpretation of reports. However, mNGS has obvious advantages in clinical diagnosis, with high specificity and accuracy, and shorter detection time than traditional culture. In the aspect of mixed infection, because of its non-bias, the detection rate of multiple pathogens is higher than that of conventional culture, smear, PCR and other tests, which can detect other pathogens and even rare pathogens that can not be detected conventionally.\n\nPrevious small sample studies have shown that the sensitivity of mNGS in urinary tract infection is high, but the specificity is relatively low, and there are many problems such as difficult interpretation of reports and low clinical conformity. For example, there are many pathogens with high reading, and the test results are sorted to form a list of pathogens, but it is impossible to determine which or which pathogens are pathogenic. This is closely related to the mNGS technology algorithm, such as the inability to eliminate the influence of urinary system background bacteria, and the ambiguity of short sequence alignment, which makes it difficult to distinguish homologous pathogens.\n\nIn this study, based on the standard mNGS sequencing process, the improved Z value analysis method was used to select strictly enrolled clinical samples and compare them with pathogen culture to observe the clinical value of mNGS with Z value analysis method in the treatment of urinary tract infection.",

The purpose of this study was to explore the factors influencing the SRR of mTESE in NOA patients with different etiologies.\n\nMethods: This observational study recruit NOA patients treated with their first mTESE. The stratified research was used to investigate SRR by dividing patients into seven groups based on etiology. The primary outcome was SRR. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze the factors influencing SRR.",
      "detailedDescription": "As the most severe form of infertility, azoospermia is observed in approximately 10% to 15% of infertile males and can be classified as obstructive azoospermia (OA) and non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), the latter of which cause spermatogenic dysfunction. Approximately 60% of NOA males are diagnosed with congenital, acquired, or idiopathic NOA (iNOA). The most common congenital causes of NOA are Klinefelter syndrome (KS) and Y chromosome azoospermia factor (AZF) deletions, whereas the acquired causes of NOA are mumps orchitis, cryptorchidism, cryptozoospermia, and iatrogenic causes (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism). For iNOA, the most common form of NOA, there is no clear cause in approximately 50-80% of cases.\n\nAs a prevalent chromosomal abnormality, KS with two or more X chromosomes is the most common form of congenital NOA that affects approximately 3-4% of infertile males and more than 10% of azoospermic males. The incidence of Y-chromosome AZF microdeletions in fertile males is 0.025%, but it increases to 2%-10% in infertile males. Mumps orchitis is the most common and serious complication of mumps virus infection in adolescents and young adults, with an incidence of 40% in males with postpubertal mumps, and approximately 30% of males suffer from infertility or subfertility. As an extremely severe form of oligozoospermia, cryptozoospermia is characterized by the absence of sperm in semen by microscopic examination but the presence of sperm in centrifuge sediment, with an incidence of approximately 8.73% in infertile males. Cryptorchidism represents one of the most common urogenital abnormalities in childhood, affecting 1.1%-45% of preterm and 1%-4.6% of full-term infants, and approximately 10% of infertile males have a history of cryptorchidism.\n\nObtaining sperm by microdissection testicular sperm extraction (mTESE) is the primary treatment approach for males with NOA. The average sperm retrieval rate (SRR) in NOA males is approximately 50%, however, NOA patients with different etiologies have different SSRs ranging from 30% to 75%, with the highest and lowest SRRs corresponding to those with a history of mumps orchitis and iNOA, respectively. The predictive factors of SRR in males with NOA treated with mTESE include age; testis volume; serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone (T), inhibin B, and anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) levels and testicular histopathology. However, the relationship between SSR and age in NOA patients undergoing mTESE is unclear, with several studies reporting no association between SSR and age or a negative correlation between SSR and age. Other studies have reported that older age was predictive of successful sperm retrieval.\n\nThe goal of this study was to analyze the factors influencing the SRR in NOA patients with different etiologies treated with mTESE based on age, body mass index (BMI), testis volume hormone levels and infertility duration in a large cohort. Our findings provide valuable information on the likelihood of successful mTESE. Therefore, preoperative evaluations based on the information provided in this study will help patients and surgeons in selecting the best approach by shared decision-making.",

      "detailedDescription": "Bladder cancer is the 9th most common diagnosed cancer according to 2021 statistics (4). It can be divided into muscle invasive (MIBC) and non muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) , based on the biopsy result after transurethral resection of the bladder tumor.In this research we will abide ourselves to the non muscle invasive bladder cancer.After the transurethral resection of bladder cancer, further management of this disease includes the intravesical instillation of chemotherapy or immunotherapeutic drugs.\n\nThe most commonly used drugs in our clinic is epirubicin and Bacillus Calmette Guerrin (BCG) for intravesical instillations.This research will focus on the use of intravesical instillations of BCG .Intravesical instillations of BCG are performed in patients with pTa/High Grade (HG), pT1/Low Grade(LG), pT1/HG and Carcinoma in Situ(CIS) tumors , while epirubicin is used in tumors pTa/LG.\n\nThe most common complications after intravesical instillation of BCG are either systemic (mycotic aneyrysms , tuberculosis, hepatitis, arthritis , spondylitis or ev enencephalitis) or are related to the urogenital system (cystitis, prostatitis which can be either tuberculous or bacterial, balanitis or tuberculous epididymitis) (3). The most common complications of the urinary system after the intravesical BCG instillation can appear as a combination of the lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) , macroscopic hematuria and fever (4).\n\nThere are researches that prove the superiority of silicon catheters for long term catheterization in terms of reduced urethral inflammation and consequently reduced LUTS (1,2). However, there is also an article that claims that latex urinary catheters that are coated with noble metals cause minimal LUTS compared with silicone catheters when used for short term catheterization (3). Nevertheless, there is not a comparative antegrade study for the use of different type of catheters for the intravesical instillation of BCG that proves the superiority of one catheter type over the other.\n\nPurpose of this study The purpose of this study is the comparison of the symptoms arising from the use of two different types of urinary catheters (latex or silicon tiemann) during the intravesical instillation of BCG and the possible display of superiority of one of those catheter types.\n\nMaterial and Methods This study is an antegrade comparative cohort study. In this are included patients of all age and genders. The patients were diagnosed with non muscle invasive bladder cancer after the transurethral resection of the bladder tumor and are undergoing intravesical BCG instillations after they get their biopsy results.They undergo either 6 weekly intravesical instillations in de novo diagnosed cancer or in 3 weekly instillations during the follow-up based on our clinic's protocol. The intravesical therapy begins 2-4 weeks after the surgery , since the patients has a negative urine culture. Another important condition is that the patient does not have macroscopic hematuria ,does not have fever or does not bleed during the catheter insertion.\n\nThe intravesical instillation is performed in the outpatient department of the 2nd University Urology Clinic in Sismanogleio Hospital ,Athens, Greece by three urologist J.M. ,T.B. and S.K.. Those three physicians use aseptic and non traumatic technique during the intravesical instillations (IVIs). For the IVIs either self lubricated silicon tiemann 10 fr urinary catheter or straight tipped latex foley 14 fr urinary catheter was used. The catheterization was done with the use of 2% xylocaine jelly in the urethra.The catheter was advanced slowly while the intravesical instillation was done slowly in a rate so that it was completed in 20-30 s.This technique was used by all the physicians.\n\nThe preparation and dilution of the drug used for the IVIs was done by the same trained nurses, under the same conditions for each case and is instilled as soon as it is ready.Before every insillation the physician asks the patient if he has symptoms since the previous instillation such as macroscopic hematuria, fever or LUTS. In case that one of those symptoms exists then the instillation is not performed.In case of hematuria ,instillation is postponed until this symptom disappears.In case of persisting LUTS until the the next instillation the patient receives antibiotic regimen based on urinary culture and continues with the instillation when the culture is negative. In case of fever above 38 celsius the patient undergoes an empiric antibiotic regimen with quinolones. If fever persists over 48 hours then the patient is reffered to an internist with subspecialisation in infectious medicine to exlude the possibility of systemic or urogenital tuberculous complication. The intravesical instillation regimen continues when the patient has no longer fever.",

The most commonly performed operation for rectal cancer is restorative proctectomy (RP), leaving up to 70% with long-term bowel dysfunction called Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (LARS).

LARS, along with other functional impairments such as sexual and urinary dysfunction (SUD), can impact quality of life (QoL) and cause emotional distress. High-quality longitudinal data on these sequalae are lacking, leading to variable estimates of their prevalence, risk factors and prognosis.

This study aims to address the following research questions: 1): How do North American rectal cancer patients who underwent RP experience changes in function (bowel, sexual and urinary), distress (emotional and financial) and QoL after RP from baseline through early and late timepoints following treatment? 2): How do patient-, disease-, treatment-, functional- and distress-related factors predict QoL at baseline and at early and late timepoints post-treatment?\n\nThis multicenter North American, observational, prospective cohort study relies on validated patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) at diagnosis, during and post-treatment.

Estimating a 30% attrition rate, in 1000 different simulated datasets and \u03b1=0.05, we will be able to detect a 1 point difference in QoL 88% of the time (95%CI: 85.8, 90.0). Given that a 10-point difference is considered clinically significant, this sample size affords good precision. 1) QoL, LARS, SUD, emotional/financial distress will be measured at baseline, early (12 \\& 18 months) and late (2 \\& 3 years) timepoints. 2) Changes over time for each outcome will be studied using linear mixed models (LMM) and generalized LMM as appropriate to account for the hierarchical and longitudinal structure of the data. 3) Factors associated with QoL will be explored using LMM. 4) Impact of patient activation in relation to functional outcomes on QoL over time will be explored using a difference-in-differences approach.

      "detailedDescription": "Pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) can adversely affect the quality of life (QoL) of a woman and they can occur during different stages of female life such as during pregnancy, early postpartum period or during menopause. The reported prevalence of PFDs varies widely both during and after pregnancy and reported up to 30-50%. Besides, the term PFD includes a broad spectrum of conditions such as urinary incontinence (UI), pelvic organ prolapse (POP) or anal incontinence (AI). Many risk factors seem to be involved like the pregnancy itself, mode of delivery, parity, the use of episiotomy, obesity, increased age and so on. It is well known that pregnancy and vaginal birth are significant risk factors in the etiology of PFDs and predicting models like UR-CHOICE score were developed for this reason to provide mothers-to-be with sufficient information regarding their subsequent risk of PFD. The identification of women during their pregnancy who are at higher risk for PFD remains a key element in targeting of prevention and planning health of resource allocation strategies. Pregnancy, childbirth and the immediate postpartum period, where the demands on the pelvic floor and the incidence of pelvic floor trauma are particularly high, offers an optimal opportunity for such counseling and prevention. The validated German pelvic floor questionnaire modified for pregnancy and postpartum period is thus an important tool identifying such symptoms and helping clinicians assess patient's quality of life. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of PFDs in a cohort of Egyptian women during pregnancy. Furthermore, we searched for clinical risk factors that correlate with the occurrence of PFDs during pregnancy in the investigator's population.",

Paclitaxel in another formulation (Taxol) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in patients with cancer. This drug can decrease growth of cancer cells and of new blood vessels. Because patients with psoriasis have an increase in skin cell and blood vessel growth, paclitaxel may also improve their condition. The dose of drug used in this study is much lower than those used to treat cancer patients and is expected to cause relatively few side effects.\n\nPatients 18 to 70 years of age with psoriasis lesions affecting at least 20% of their skin may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a history and physical examination, blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram, and possibly an exercise stress test.\n\nParticipants will receive six intravenous (through a vein) infusions of paclitaxel over a 6-month period. Each infusion will take about 2 hours. Patients will stay in the clinic for observation for at least 1 hour before going home and will return to the clinic for follow-up examination and tests one week after each infusion. However, on weeks 0 and 8 visit will last for approximately 8 hours and will require a return to the clinic the following morning. Blood collection will be performed during the week 0 and 8 visits to determine how fast Micellar Paclitaxel is eliminated from your body. Approximately 2 teaspoons of blood will be taken prior to the infusion, twice during the infusion, and eight times during the 22 hours following the infusion for a total of eleven samples. These return visits will last approximately 1-2 hours. Patients will have the following procedures:\n\n1. A skin biopsy (removal of a small tissue sample for microscopic examination) will be done at the first visit (week 0) and again at weeks 6, 14 and 22. The area of the biopsy will be numbed with an anesthetic, and a small circle of skin about the width of a pencil eraser and half as deep will be cut and lifted away. Stitches will be placed and removed 1 to 2 weeks later.\n2. A history and physical examination will be done at every visit. Patients will be interviewed about changes in their skin condition and about treatment side effects and will be examined by a nurse or physician.\n3. Blood and urine samples will be collected at frequent intervals (nearly every visit) to test for side effects.\n4. Photographs of the skin will be taken at the first visit and at several later visits to document changes in psoriasis.\n5. A blood sample will be drawn for genetic testing to look for gene changes in people with psoriasis.\n6. An electrocardiogram will be taken at the last visit. This will be done at week 24 and compared to the screening EKG.\n7. Gonadal toxicity monitoring will be started with all patients entered into the protocol as of May 2001. Blood will be drawn to measure Inhibit A for females and Inhibit B for males at weeks 0, 6, 14, and 22.",
      "detailedDescription": "Paclitaxel is an antiangiogenic chemotherapeutic drug approved by the FDA for use in cancer. There is anecdotal evidence that some patients with cancer and concomitant psoriasis have shown improvement in their skin while receiving paclitaxel for cancer. Angiotech Pharmaceutical, Inc., the company with commercial rights over non-cancer uses of paclitaxel, has data that suggests paclitaxel demonstrates anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, in addition to the better known antiangiogenic and antiproliferative effects attributed to this compound. In this pilot open-label single-dose study, we initially treated patients with severe refractory psoriasis using intravenous Micellar Paclitaxel (75 mg/m(2) every 4 weeks) for six months. Because this dosing regimen was well tolerated and because the dosing interval seemed too long, we now propose to treat patients with intravenous Micellar Paclitaxel at the adjusted dose of 37.5 mg/m(2) every 2 weeks.",

The purpose of this study is to see if giving CD4-IgG2 to HIV-infected children is safe and effective.\n\nHIV attaches to CD4 cells and enters them. Inside, HIV makes copies of itself that will help the virus invade the body. CD4 cells are killed or disabled during this process of HIV replication. Decreases in CD4 cells lead to a weakened immune system. When CD4 cell counts become very low, the body is unable to defend itself, and HIV infection develops into AIDS. The protein used in this study, CD4-IgG2, may be able to attach to HIV and inactivate it so that it cannot enter CD4 cells.

      "description": "Studies on patterns of how many men get prostate cancer in other countries show that environment contributes to the high incidence of prostate cancer in the United States. Epidemiology studies suggest that this influence may be reduced by the diet of men at risk of getting prostate cancer. Although the exact nature of the effects of diet are not completely known, the amount of fat eaten appears to affect the number of men who get prostate cancer. The type of fat also seems to matter. Eating more of a type of fat called omega-3 polyunsaturated fat is associated with decreased prostate cancer risk. Omega-3 fat comes from fish and is quite different from the type of fat from animals and vegetables (omega-6 fat). Because the exact mechanism of this reduction in prostate cancer risk is not known, no blood test indications, called markers, have been discovered that would show the effect working.\n\nStudy doctors designed this study to try to find markers in the blood tests of men who have prostate cancer, and to find out if a diet supplemented with omega-3 type fat from fish oil helps reduce those markers, hence indicating that it helps reduce the cancer in these men. These men will be compared to men with prostate cancer whose diets do not contain the fish-oil fat.\n\nThe men chosen will have prostate cancer and be scheduled for operations to have their prostate glands removed. They will be chosen randomly to be given the fish-oil diet or a regular Western diet for comparison for 4 to 8 weeks. Their blood will be checked at the beginning of the diet. After the 4-to-8-week period, they will have their operations. Their blood will be checked again and a sample of their removed prostate will be examined to tell if the diet had any effect on the cancer and its markers.",
      "detailedDescription": "1. To establish and validate intermediate biomarkers for prostate cancer prevention trials by conducting a dietary intervention trial of a low-fat diet with omega-3 fatty acid supplements in men undergoing radical prostatectomy. In initial trials it was feasible to intervene with diet and obtain tissue and serum for bioassay and biomarker development. This aim is to study the effect a low-fat, high omega-3 diet has on serum and tissue biomarkers from patients who have prostatectomies for prostate cancer. Ultimately, we hope to identify and validate intermediate markers of efficacy for large-scale dietary prevention trials.\n2. To establish and validate insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and insulin growth factor binding proteins (IGFBP) as relevant intermediate biomarkers for prostate cancer prevention trials. IGF-1 is a peptide growth factor that is important to the growth and progression of prostate cancer. To our knowledge, no prospective dietary intervention studies have evaluated the effect of a low-fat diet with omega-3 fatty acid supplements on IGF-1 and IGFBPs, and their potential to serve as relevant intermediate markers for low-fat dietary intervention trials for prostate cancer prevention.\n3. To establish and validate serum and tissue fatty acids as relevant intermediate biomarkers for prostate cancer prevention trials. We will evaluate if men randomized to a low-fat, fish-oil-supplemented diet have increased serum ratios of omega-3:omega-6 fatty acids compared with men randomized to a control Western diet before radical prostatectomy. We also will study if patients in the low-fat, fish oil arm have increased ratios of membrane omega-3:omega-6 fatty acids as well as decreased COX-2 and decreased PGE-2 levels in benign and malignant tissue and in visceral fat. If so, it will proved further evidence to support the potential of low-fat fish oil diets for prostate cancer prevention. If serum omega-3:omega-6 ratios correlate with changes in COX-2 and PGE-2 in tissues, then serum omea-3:omega-6 ratios may be useful for monitoring activity and efficacy of low-fat fish-oil-supplemented diets in future trials.",

The NTHi-Mcat investigational vaccine and placebo will be given on top of standard of care to subjects in the respective study groups.\n\nIn the current study, moderate, severe and very severe COPD patients (i.e. GOLD grade 2, 3 and 4) with a history of AECOPD will receive 2 doses of the NTHi-Mcat investigational vaccine or placebo intramuscularly (IM) according to a 0, 2 month vaccination schedule, in addition to standard care.\n\nScheduled study visits, during which the effect of immunisation against NTHi and Mcat will be evaluated, will take place at pre-defined timepoints.\n\nIn addition to the scheduled study visits, ad hoc AECOPD-driven study visit(s) and/ or phone contact(s) will take place for each AECOPD occurring from first vaccination up to study conclusion:\n\n* An AECOPD visit will be scheduled as soon as possible after the onset of the AECOPD symptoms (maximum 96 hours after the onset of the symptoms).\n* Follow-up visit(s) and/or phone call(s) will take place to determine the end of the AECOPD.\n\nRationale for the protocol amendment:\n\n* CD8+ T cell component was removed from the secondary endpoint, but kept in the exploratory/tertiary endpoint. Previous clinical studies have shown that the investigational NTHi and NTHi-Mcat vaccines do not induce CD8+ T cell responses. This was observed in all studies performed with the NTHi vaccine and seen in the interim analysis of NTHi Mcat-001 study.\n* An exclusion criterion was updated to clarify that only subjects with clinically significant respiratory diseases other than COPD (e.g. clinically significant lung fibrosis, clinically significant pulmonary embolism) need to be excluded from study participation.\n* The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for sputum samples was not designed to discriminate amongst Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) serotypes. Results from AERIS epidemiological study \\[Wilkinson, 2017\\] showed that more than 99% of these bacteria would be Non-Typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi). Therefore, the protocol was updated to clarify that the presence of Hi bacteria in sputum during exacerbation will be used to determine AECOPD associated to NTHi.\n* The list of potential immune mediated diseases was updated (effective June 30th 2017).\n* The 87% confidence interval (CI) was removed from all secondary analyses. This confidence interval will only be maintained for the primary analysis because the 95% CIs are underpowered for this study. All other sensitivity analyses on different cohorts will be described using 95% CIs. As the primary objective will have both 87% and 95%, the sensitivity analyses can be interpreted with 95% CIs.\n* A Full-Analysis Set (FAS) that corresponds to an intent-to-treat analysis was added. The FAS will include all randomized subjects who will receive at least 1 vaccine administration and, as per intention-to-treat principle, a subject in the FAS will be analysed \"as randomized\" (i.e. according to the vaccine a subject was planned to receive irrespectively of his/her real exposure).\n* Cut-off values for anti-PE, anti-PilA and anti-UspA2 antibody ELISAs were updated following the re-set up of the assays.\n* Additional minor updates were based on the scientific and operational experience gained from current COPD studies.",

      "description": "Prostate cancer is the only type of cancer in which conventional dendritic cells (DC) treatment has a beneficial effect on the overall survival. In this study investigators aim to show immunologic efficacy of tumor-peptide loaded natural DC in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients (mCRPC).\n\nThe immunomonitoring will include:\n\n1. functional response and tetramer analysis of delayed-type hypersensitivity infiltrating lymphocytes against tumor peptides and\n2. type I interferon (IFN) gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and\n3. proliferative, effector cytokine- and humoral responses to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, a immunogenic protein providing T cell help.\n\nThe secondary objectives are the safety and feasibility of natural DC vaccinations, the influence on the quality of life during treatment with natural DC, and the clinical efficacy of treatment.",
      "detailedDescription": "Immunotherapy with DC vaccines Prevention of infectious diseases through immunization is one of the greatest achievements of modern medicine. Nonetheless, considerable challenges remain for improving the efficacy of existing vaccines for therapeutic immunizations for diseases such as cancer. More than 10 years ago the first groups introduced tumor antigen-loaded DC-based vaccines in the clinic. Effective immune responses and favorable clinical outcomes have indeed been observed. Thus far, mainly conventional in vitro generated monocyte-derived DCs (moDC) have been used in clinical trials worldwide. Long lasting tumor specific T cell-mediated immunological responses are clearly linked to increased progression free survival as well as overall survival.\n\nHowever, moDC may not be the optimal source of DCs for DC vaccination studies, due to extensive culture periods and compounds required to obtain mature moDC. Two principal subsets of human blood DC, called plasmacytoid DC (pDC) and myeloid DC (mDC), are possibly a better alternative since they do not require extensive culture periods and are directly isolable from the peripheral-blood. Based on promising immunological and clinical outcome with pDC and mDC vaccinations in metastatic melanoma patients, further testing of these blood DC subsets is warranted. Based on these observations investigators are convinced that pDC and mDC employ different, and probably more optimal mechanisms to combat cancer. In addition, based on in vitro data and preclinical studies that suggest that natural DC act synergistically, investigators hypothesize that the combination of pDC and mDC may induce stronger anti-tumor immune responses as compared to pDC or mDC alone.\n\nImmunotherapy in prostate cancer Prostate cancer is the most common noncutaneous cancer in men. In recent years novel therapies have been studied extensively. Prostate cancer is usually diagnosed in men above 65 years of age. Depending on the severity of the disease, current treatment options for prostate cancer consist of active surveillance, prostatectomy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, or chemotherapy. Up to one-third of patients with a localized tumor eventually fails on local therapy and progress to advanced-stage or metastatic disease within 10 years. Although the majority of patients initially respond to anti-androgens, most tumors become resistant within 14 to 30 months. For men with mCRPC the median survival in phase III studies range from 15 to 19 months. The chemotherapeutic drug docetaxel was for several years the only treatment option for mCRPC, resulting in a median overall survival benefit of two to three months compared to mitoxantrone. In the past five years second-line chemotherapy (cabazitaxel), second-generation androgen deprivation therapy (abiraterone acetate plus prednisone and enzalutamide), cellular immunotherapy (sipuleucel-T), and a targeted alpha emitter (radium-223 treatment) have expanded the treatment repertoire for mCRPC.\n\nSipuleucel-T, a DC-based vaccine for patients suffering from prostate cancer, has shown to be clinically effective and is approved by the Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency for mCRPC patients. A major advantage of cellular immunotherapy when compared to chemotherapy, and even androgen deprivation therapy, is its low toxicity. Several other immunotherapeutic approached have been investigated and potential tumor antigens have been identified. Prostvac (vaccinia-prostate-specific antigen) was administered in a randomized phase II study with encouraging results. Ipilimumab had promising results in several phase II studies and in combination with a vaccine, such as GVAX. However, in a phase III study post-chemotherapy trial ipilimumab seemed not superior to placebo. Hence, only sipuleucel-T had clinical significant results in clinical trials.\n\nThe promising immunological and clinical outcome with pDC and mDC in metastatic melanoma warrants further testing of these blood DC in prostate cancer. In this study investigators aim to show proof-of-principle of natural DC immunogenicity in prostate cancer patients: induction/enhancement of tumor-specific T cells by mDC and induction of an IFN signature by pDC. Investigators will also get insight if combining subsets improves immunogenicity and clinical outcome. Hence, there is an urgent need for a potent treatment modality together with a solid predictive and prognostic biomarker.",

HCC represents the sixth most common cancer worldwide. In Egypt, it represents the fourth common cancer. Egypt ranks the third and 15th most populous country in Africa and worldwide, respectively. HCC is a commonly diagnosed cancer in males and females. It can lead to multi-organ failure including the respiratory system.Patients with liver cirrhosis and HCC are vulnerable to many side effects that reduce their lifetime. One of these side effects is hypoxia resulting from Many conditions which can influence the gas exchange in the lungs. Ascites, pleural effusion, hepatomegaly, and basal lung lobes atelectasis are the most commonly identified causes and can disturb oxygen exchange in a restrictive manner. On the other hand, some side effects of cirrhosis such as hepatopulmonary syndrome or portopulmonary hypertension may make the prognosis worse.Pulmonary function tests (PFTS) are important as an investigation and monitoring of patients with respiratory pathology. They provide important information relating to the large and small airways, the pulmonary parenchyma, and the size and integrity of the pulmonary capillary bed. Although they do not provide a definite diagnosis, different patterns of abnormalities are seen in different respiratory diseases which help to establish the diagnosis.There is no simple mechanism to explain the association between liver disease and hypoxemia and there are probably many factors that have a role in its pathogenesis. Although none of them have been proven as the sole reason, nevertheless ascites, hepatopulmonary syndrome, low albumin levels, anemia, respiratory muscle weakness, and extreme hepatomegaly are still considered among the factors implicated in the pathogenesis of hypoxemia in cirrhosis .Pulmonary complications such as hepatopulmonary syndrome and pulmonary hypertension are observed frequently in these patients. The clinical picture characterized by hypoxemia in absence of primary heart and lung diseases in patients with liver failure is called hepatopulmonary syndrome. In hepatopulmonary syndrome, there is an increase in the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient and a concomitant dilatation of the intrapulmonary vasculature during the inhalation of room air in addition to liver disease. Varying degrees of pulmonary findings including dyspnea, cyanosis, clubbing, and platypnea due to dilatations in the intrapulmonary vasculature (increase in dyspnea upon the shift from lying to standing position) and orthodeoxia (increase in hypoxia upon the shift from lying to standing position), and hypoxemia are seen in patients with HPS in cirrhotic and HCC patients.In general, PFT is employed to measure lung volumes, bronchial obstruction, gas exchange, lung compliance, and ventilatory capacity. Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are characterized by reduced lung volumes (restrictive ventilatory impairment), reduced (static) lung compliance, and reduced diffusing capacity. The pattern of lung function impairments does not allow a specific diagnosis to be made, but rather enables one to assess the presence or absence and the severity of lung involvement. Spirometry is a simple test to measure static lung volumes at rest-slow (inspiratory or expiratory) vital capacity (SVC), forced vital capacity (FVC)-and dynamic volumes-forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), flow-volume loops",

      "detailedDescription": "Background\n\nDiabetic kidney disease (DKD), as one of the most common and serious complications of diabetes, has become the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) worldwide. A domestic epidemiological survey shows that the prevalence of DKD in community patients was 30%-50% from 2009 to 2012, and accounted for about 40% in hospitalized patients in China. At present, the treatment of DKD is the comprehensive management of blood glucose, blood pressure and blood lipid. Nevertheless, about one-third of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and nearly half of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) will progress to ESRD. Patients with DKD have higher complication rates and mortality. Studies have shown that the mortality rate of patients with diabetes complicated with DKD is 3 to 12 times higher than that of patients with simple diabetes. Although blood glucose is actively controlled and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) are used to control hypertension in the treatment of diabetes, the progression of DKD is still inevitable. Much more clinical needs are still present. Sodium-glucose co-transporter inhibitors (SGLT2i) are new hypoglycemic drugs discovered in recent years. They play their hypoglycemic roles by inhibiting glucose reabsorption in renal tubules and increasing urinary glucose excretion. More clinical studies have found that SGLT2s not only the hypoglycemic effect, but also has the effect of delaying the progression of DKD and improving the prognosis of heart failure, and is recommended by international authoritative guidelines with class IA evidence for cardiorenal organ protection.\n\nGlucose cannot freely pass through the cell membrane and must rely on glucose transporter proteins on the cell membrane. Sodium-dependent glucose cotransporters (SGLTs) are an important family of transporter proteins that regulate glucose absorption and excretion. SGLT1 and SGLT2 are the most well studied members of this family and are both major glucose transporter proteins. SGLT1 is expressed in various tissues such as the small intestine, heart and kidney. SGLT2 is mainly expressed in segment S1 of the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney.\n\nIn the renal tubules, 95% of glucose is reabsorbed through SGLT2, and 5% of glucose is reabsorbed through SGLT1. When SGLT2 is inhibited, the glucose reabsorbed through SGLT1 significantly increases to 50%, so the hypoglycemic effect of SGLT2 inhibitors may be weakened. The dual effects of SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibitors can bring more potential benefits for treatment, including continuing to maintain the effectiveness of SGLT2 selective inhibitors; inducing intestinal cells to secrete endogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and YY peptide (PYY); reducing the adverse reactions of SGLT2 inhibition, such as genitourinary tract infections and constipation; blocking or delaying the absorption of glucose by the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nSotagliflozin is a SGLT2i with partial SGLT1 inhibitory activity. It was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2019 for adjuvant treatment of T1DM complicated with obesity. Recently, the sotagliflozin heart failure protection study was terminated in the middle stage due to the excellent effect of improving the outcome of heart failure. And it has a good effect of reducing proteinuria in patients with DKD. This suggests that SGLT1/2 dual-channel blockers may have better hypoglycemic and organ protection effects.\n\nYG1699 is an oral SGLT1 and SGLT2 dual-channel blocker, belonging to c-aryl glucoside derivatives. It can reduce the absorption of glucose into the blood in the gastrointestinal tract by inhibiting SGLT-1, and at the same time inhibit the reabsorption of glucose in the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney by inhibiting SGLT-2, thereby increasing the excretion of glucose from the kidney and effectively reducing blood glucose levels. YG1699 reduces the risk of DKA caused by SGLT2i by increasing SGLT1 inhibitory activity. In addition, YG1699 shows non-pH-dependent solubility, has sufficient solubility in the gastrointestinal tract, has a high oral bioavailability in preclinical models, and has a low possibility of drug interactions. At present, including YG1699, there are three SGLT1/2 dual inhibitor are in the clinical research stage.\n\nYG1699 has completed three clinical trials, named the phase I study (YG1699-01) on healthy subjects in the United States and the phase II study (YG1699-201) on type 1 diabetes, as well as the bridging study (YG1699-102) on healthy subjects in China. These clinical studies have confirmed that YG1699 has good human PK characteristics and good safety and tolerance. In the phase II T1DM study, compared head-to-head with DAPA, it shows a better effect on reducing postprandial blood glucose. All these clinical trials are in patients with eGFR\\&gt;30 ml/min/1.73M2.\n\nHowever, about 12 million diabetic patients have renal insufficiency, and there is still no pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data of YG1699 in patients with renal insufficiency.\n\nKey inclusion criteria include:\n\n1. Ability to provide informed consent\n2. Male or female patients ,age between 18 and 70 at screening\n3.

      "description": "If radical cystectomy remains the standard of care for muscle invasive bladder cancer, consequences of this surgical procedure are often harsh. Over the past years, concurrent chemo-radiotherapy has imposed itself as an alternative treatment. Published data on concomitant radiochemotherapy (radiotherapy/cisplatin or radiotherapy/cisplatin/5-fluorouracil combinations) showed local control rates with bladder preservation at 5 years ranging from 40% to 65% according to the disease stage, and overall survival probabilities ranging from 40% to 50% at 5 years. In order to improve local and systemic prognosis, evaluation of other chemotherapy agents with higher radiosensitizing effect, such as gemcitabine, is justified. Gemcitabine possesses its own anti-cancer activities on urothelial diseases and has a synergetic activity with cisplatin. The investigators completed a monocenter phase I study combining radiotherapy, cisplatin, and twice-weekly gemcitabine, and determined a recommended dose of gemcitabine 25 mg/m\u00b2.

      "detailedDescription": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects more than 200 million of the global population. PAD represents a marker for premature cardiovascular events.\n\nDespite the high prevalence of PAD and the strong association with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, patients with PAD are less likely to receive appropriate treatment for their atherosclerotic risk factors than those who are being treated for coronary artery disease.\n\nBecause PAD represents a peripheral manifestation of atherosclerosis, most traditional and novel cardiovascular risk factors are strongly associated with this condition. Smoking, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, unhealthy diet, and physical inactivity were identified as significant modifiable risk factors that should be targeted for secondary prevention.\n\nAtherosclerotic risk factor identification and modification plays an important role in reducing the number of adverse outcomes among patients with atherosclerosis. Risk reduction therapy decreases the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with PAD. Because of the efficacy of these techniques, several expert committees have recommended their use in patients with PAD. Despite clear guidelines, several studies have shown that patients with PAD are routinely undertreated for these risk factors, which may contribute to high rates of morbidity and mortality.\n\nOur trial will evaluate the impact of a 12-week, structured lifestyle and risk factor modification programme on medical and lifestyle risk factors modification, as well as on clinical vascular outcomes, among patients with peripheral arterial disease. We will compare these outcomes to that of standard healthcare traditionally provided to this high-risk patient group.",

      "description": "Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is one of the most common urinary disorders in elderly males. The symptoms of BPH include impaired physiological and functional well-being, which interferes with daily living.\n\nAt present, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is the standard surgical treatment. However, the high rate of complications associated with TURP is a major drawback of this procedure.\n\nHolmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) was proven to be an effective surgical treatment for BPH with no prostate size limitation with adequate hemostasis, bipolar enucleation of the prostate (BPEP) has been introduced as an alternative energy source with a promising outcome with equal safety and efficacy",
      "detailedDescription": "Enlarged prostate represents the most common cause of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in elderly men including irritative, obstructive urinary symptoms or even urinary retention that significantly affects the quality life (QoL).\n\nTransurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) represents the standard surgical technique for the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with a prostate size less than 80 ml. However, considerable morbidities are associated with larger sizes.\n\nEndoscopic enucleation of the prostate (EEP) has been recognized as a treatment option for large prostatic adenomas, since first described by Hiraoka et.al, in 1986, it started to gain popularity despite the long learning curve. Many studies have evaluated its efficacy against the gold standard open prostatectomy in large prostate size more than 80ml and showed its safety and efficacy.\n\nEEP represents an anatomical surgical technique resembling a surgeon's finger in open prostatectomy where any energy source that provides adequate haemostasis could be used. Many studies concluded that EEP relies on the surgeon's skills rather than the energy source itself. Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) was first described by Gilling in 1998 and was proven to be effective with no prostate size limitation with adequate haemostasis, recently it has been approved as a standard treatment for large prostatic adenoma, bipolar enucleation of the prostate (BPEP) has been introduced as an alternative energy source with a promising outcome with equal safety and efficacy.\n\nFew studies evaluated both techniques, one study was done by Shoma et al. showing no statistical difference regarding safety and efficacy between both techniques, another study conducted by Enikeev et al. reported earlier recovery and catheter removal with HoLEP compared to BPEP. However, cost-effectiveness was never been evaluated before between both techniques especially in developing countries.\n\nWith such scarce information, the investigators aimed through this study to compare these two energy sources in the enucleation procedure of the prostate in terms of safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness in the management of BPH in large prostatic adenoma more than 80 ml.",

      "detailedDescription": "Background and rationale: The pharmacological handling of pediatric incontinence is considered temporary and withdrawal attempts are recommended after continence has been achieved. There is no generally accepted withdrawal strategy for solifenacin and/or mirabegron in children. Currently, two different withdrawal strategies are being employed in the clinical setting, namely abrupt withdrawal, and gradual withdrawal, wherein the dosage of the drug prescribed is reduced or the interval between dosages given is increased. Studies report on the differences in withdrawal strategies of antidiuretic therapy targeted at enuresis in pediatric populations. Several studies have reported on the application of structured withdrawal of desmopressin, indicating that gradual withdrawal of desmopressin therapy results in prolonged intervals of continence without relapse. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have investigated the strategy of withdrawal of pharmacological treatment with solifenacin and/or mirabegron in children diagnosed with urinary incontinence that have achieved continence on these pharmaceuticals. Our study is proposed to ensure an evidence-based approach to a withdrawal of strategy for pharmacological treatment with solifenacin and/or mirabegron in children with urinary incontinence.\n\nObjectives: The primary objective is to investigate if abrupt withdrawal versus gradual withdrawal of pharmacotherapy (solifenacin and/or mirabegron) influences the risk of recurrence of incontinence. We hypothesize that gradual withdrawal is superior to abrupt withdrawal regarding the risk of recurrence of incontinence.\n\nStudy design: This is an open-label prospective randomized trial, allocating participant to each of the three pharmaceutical groups, according to the medical treatment that the child is receiving (solifenacin, mirabegron or solifenacin in combination with mirabegron). Within each pharmaceutical group, the participant will be randomized 1:1 to the intervention being compared; either abrupt withdrawal or gradual withdrawal.\n\nPerspectives:The results are expected to influence the withdrawal strategy of pharmacological treatment with solifenacin and/or mirabegron in children with daytime urinary incontinence.\n\nEthics: All pharmacological side effects will be handled in accordance with the Danish legislation. No risk or unknown side effects are expected to medical treatment or withdrawal. The therapeutic potential for future patients justifies the project to be carried out. Participation in this study will not lead to any disadvantages for the patient in their treatment. The study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, applicable regulatory requirements according to Good Clinical Practice and the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study has been approved by the authorities and was initiated in May 2024. Significant additions or changes to the protocol may be conducted after the application for amendment is approved by the Regulatory Authority and the Ethics Committee.

A good quality vein is one of the main factors that influence the clinical success of open revascularization for below-knee popliteal. In the absence of an suitable autologous vein, prosthesis such as polytetrafluoroethylen (PTFE) graft could be an option but demonstrated worse clinical and morphological results compared to autologous greater saphenous vein. Consequently, there is still a room for improvement in CLI patients in the absence of an suitable autologous vein in whom endovascular repair failed.\n\nRecently, PTFE with heparin-bound to the luminal surface (Hb-PTFE) significantly reduced the overall risk of primary graft failure by 37%, in particular, risk reduction was 50% in femoropopliteal bypass cases in cases with critical ischemia (58% Primary patency for crude ePTFE versus 80% primary patency for PROPATEN at 1 year follow-up) (Lindholt, et. al. 2011).\n\nAdditionally, a weighted average from the literature suggests a 76% primary patency for below knee bypasses performed with PROPATEN at one year follow-up, whereas a published meta-analysis suggests a 59% primary patency for below knee crude ePTFE at one year follow-up. At two year follow-up using the same approach, the average primary patency for PROPATEN was 67% versus 43% for standard ePTFE.\n\nThe aim of this study is to assess PTFE with heparin-bound to the luminal surface as an alternative to crude PTFE in absence of good venous conduit in patients with CLI.",

      "description": "Early diabetic kidney disease (DKD) occurs in 50-70% of youth with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and confers high lifetime risk of dialysis and premature death. Youth-onset T2D typically manifests during or shortly after puberty in adolescents with obesity. Epidemiological data implicate puberty as an accelerator of kidney disease in youth with obesity and diabetes and the investigators posit that the link between puberty and T2D-onset may explain the high burden of DKD in youth-onset T2D. A better understanding of the impact of puberty on kidney health is needed to promote preservation of native kidney function, especially in youth with T2D.",
      "detailedDescription": "Puberty is a complex process of physiological changes, including neuroreproductive and growth hormone activation and rapid organ growth, that may predispose organs to injury. The kidneys may be especially susceptible because they are highly metabolically active and second only to the heart with respect to oxygen consumption per tissue mass. During puberty, the kidneys almost double in size, likely increasing the kidneys' already high energy expenditure. In parallel, puberty is associated with physiologic insulin resistance (IR), which is accentuated in obesity. Our central hypothesis is that obese youth with prediabetes and T2D experience relative kidney hypoxia during puberty due to a metabolic mismatch between increased energy expenditure and impaired substrate metabolism. In turn, the kidney hypoxia results in loss of glomerular charge and size selectivity leading to increased transglomerular transport of protein and kidney dysfunction. Our preliminary data showed that pubertal adolescents with obesity and/or diabetes exhibit relative kidney hypoxia compared to normal weight controls using functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and that relative kidney hypoxia is greater in late vs. early puberty. However, determining the pubertal mechanisms contributing to kidney injury in youth with obesity and T2D requires serial evaluations throughout puberty. To assess the impact of pubertal changes within a 5-year study period, the investigators propose an accelerated longitudinal study design in which the investigators will enroll adolescents (8-14 years, 50% girls) with obesity and/or elevated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c \u22656%) \\[n=60\\], and healthy normoglycemic controls \\[n=40\\] at Tanner (pubertal) stages 1-4 and examine them at baseline, 1 and 2-years. The investigators will then compare data by Tanner stage to construct an integrated portrayal of the physiological changes that occur throughout puberty. Given the rarity of T2D prior to pubertal onset, the investigators chose to enroll a high high-risk group: youth with obesity and/or HbA1c \u22656.0% to represent youth ranging from those at magnified risk of developing T2D to those recently diagnosed.",

      "description": "In sub-Saharan Africa, engaging men in HIV prevention, care, and treatment has proven challenging. Along all steps of the HIV care-seeking cascade, men exhibit worse care-seeking behaviors than women. They are less likely to be tested for HIV, initiate combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), and be retained in cART care. Additionally, men rarely engage in the care of their female sex partners, even though couple care-seeking is associated with marked improvements in condom use within HIV-discordant couples. Option B+, Malawi's program for providing immediate, lifelong combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) to all HIV-infected pregnant women at the time of diagnosis, is an important entry-point for involving male partners in care.\n\nThis is a pilot randomized controlled trial (N=200 women) comparing two strategies of male partner involvement within the Option B+ program. In both arms (patient referral and contract referral) women will be encouraged to invite their male partners to accompany them to the clinic for couple HIV counseling and testing. In the contract referral arm, if the couple does not present within one week, the male partner will receive a home visit encouraging them to present to the clinic. We will compare the two arms for 1) uptake of couple HIV counseling and testing (cHCT), 2) uptake of cART for women, and 3) linkage to care for HIV-infected men. Results are expected to inform a larger trial and ultimately improve care-seeking in Malawi's HIV program.\n\nObjective 1: Determine acceptability of male partner recruitment for cHTC within an Option B+ context. We will assess acceptability of eligible females to participate in this pilot RCT and reasons for non-participation.\n\nObjective 2: Assess whether study arm (patient referral versus contract referral) is associated with cHTC uptake. We will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of male partner recruitment. This study will contain two arms: patient referral and contract referral for uptake of cHTC (primary outcome).",

      "description": "Researchers are looking for a better way to treat men who have non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC). This is a type of cancer of the prostate that has not yet spread to other parts of the body and that keeps progressing even when the amount of male sex hormones like testosterone (also called androgens) is reduced to very low levels. To reduce androgen levels in prostate cancer patients, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is often used. As androgens stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells, low levels are needed to reduce or slow the growth of these tumors.\n\nIn men with nmCRPC, the cancer worsens despite low testosterone levels (also called castration resistant).\n\nProstate-specific antigen (PSA) is a protein that is made by both normal cells and by cancerous cells in the body. Thus, PSA levels can be taken as a marker for prostate cancer development.\n\nMen with nmCRPC usually have higher levels of (PSA) than normal. They are considered \"high risk\" if they show signs of quickly increasing PSA levels as this could mean that the tumor is growing and might spread to other parts of the body.\n\nThe study treatment darolutamide is already available in certain countries for doctors to prescribe to men with prostate cancer that has not yet spread to other parts of the body. It works by blocking androgens from attaching to proteins in cancer cells in the prostate.\n\nResults of a previous study in men with high-risk nmCRPC who received darolutamide in addition to ADT are already available, but this study had no Indian patients and was not conducted in India.\n\nTherefore, the main purpose of this study is to learn how safe darolutamide is when taken in addition to ADT in Indian participants with high-risk nmCRPC.\n\nTo answer this question, the researchers will collect all medical problems the participants have that arise during the study and that may or may not be related to the study treatment. These medical problems are also known as \"adverse events\" (AE). The following information regarding safety of darolutamide will be collected during the study:\n\n* the number and severity of AEs that are non-serious or serious\n* the number of participants who have to permanently stop the treatment due to AEs\n* the number of participants who have to change the amount of study drug taken due to AEs\n\nAEs can be:\n\n* abnormal results of laboratory tests, physical examinations, or heart health examinations using ECG (detects heart problems by measuring the electrical activity generated by the heart as it contracts).\n* relevant changes in vital signs\n* relevant changes of the participant's daily living abilities (ECOG performance status)\n\nThese results will then be compared with the results from the previous study to identify any differences for this group of participants.\n\nIn addition, researchers will collect and compare data on how well darolutamide worked under real world conditions in this group of participants.\n\nAll participants will take darolutamide as tablets by mouth twice a day. The participants will visit the study center at the start of the study, and then every 16 weeks until their cancer gets worse, they develop medical problems, they leave the study or until the study is terminated.\n\nDuring the study, the study team will\n\n* take blood and urine samples\n* do physical examinations\n* check vital signs\n* examine heart health using ECG\n* assess the participant's ECOG performance status\n* ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what AEs they are having.\n\nIf the trial is stopped, participants may have the option to continue to receive darolutamide, provided they benefit from the treatment.",

      "detailedDescription": "In resource-limited settings, there has been a significant increase in access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in recent years. Although there remain serious limitations in access to ART in these settings, for many who have initiated and continue treatment, HIV disease is a chronic condition that needs to be managed over time. There is considerable evidence that individuals with chronic illness have an increased risk of depression, in part related to the challenges in coping and managing their illness. Rates for depression during pregnancy in women living with HIV are estimated to be higher.\n\nDespite this relatively high burden of depression among persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA), it has been documented that clinical staff working with PLHA do not routinely identify or treat depression in this setting. This is in contrast to recent revisions in the Tanzanian health policy that emphasize integrating mental health and HIV care at district and lower level health care services. The long-term intent of the research is to bridge this gap between Tanzanian health policy and implementation of integrating mental health care among pre- and post-natal women receiving HIV care. Therefore, the overall goal of the proposed study is to examine the potential for successful integration of enhanced mental health care and group counseling among HIV-positive women receiving preventing mother to child transmission (PMTCT)-plus services and to evaluate a combination of evidence-based approaches in treatment of depression in this vulnerable population in Tanzania.\n\nSpecifically this application aims to:\n\n1.

      "description": "Because of the high incidence of post-radiation erectile dysfunction (ED), up to 72% after external-beam radiotherapy, this patient category represents a most difficult therapeutic challenge. Therefore, prevention of ED could be more effective than treatment. Tadalafil, a new phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, has been recently introduced. No studies have investigated the efficacy of tadalafil in preventing ED in patients undergoing radiotherapy for prostate cancer. Efficacy of tadalafil can last up to 36 hours after intake. This will result in a prolonged and continuos enhancement of penile vascular responsiveness. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study has been designed to evaluate the efficacy of 20-mg of tadalafil administered for 12 months in maintaining erectile function of potent patients undergoing external-beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer.",
      "detailedDescription": "It will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial. Patients scheduled for external-beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer will start using tadalafil 20 mg or placebo the first day of radiation. The blinded medication (active drug or placebo) has to be taken once every two days starting the day of the first radiation up to 12 months (52 weeks) after radiotherapy. The active drug or placebo may be taken at bedtime unrelated to sexual activity. In case of side effects the dose can be reduced to 10 mg. Erectile function will be assessed every 3 months up to 6 weeks (week 58) after discontinuation of drug treatment by using questions 3 and 4 of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Responders (maintained erectile function) are defined as having a combined score of \\>=8 for the IIEF questions 3 and 4.",
      "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Men, at least 18 years of age, willing to participate in the study and willing to regularly attempt sexual activity.\n2.

This study will also evaluate whether certain genetic factors of the X chromosome affect the psychological or motor features of XXY/Klinefelter syndrome.",
      "detailedDescription": "Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) is the most common chromosomal abnormality in humans and occurs in approximately 1 in 650 males. Testosterone deficiency develops during adolescence in the majority of individuals with XXY. However, there are no previous studies that evaluate the psychological and motor effects of testosterone replacement therapy in adolescents with XXY.\n\nThe study researchers are interested in learning if testosterone therapy initiated in early puberty in XXY (KS) will lead to improvements in psychological and/or motor skills. They are also interested in learning if genetic variations of the androgen receptor gene or the parent-of-origin of the extra X chromosome influence the response to testosterone therapy.\n\nSpecific psychological factors to be studied include verbal and nonverbal cognitive skills, attention, executive function (organization, problem-solving skills, inhibition), anxiety, language, self-esteem, and other behavioral factors. Motor skills to be studied include gross and fine motor skills, motor coordination, and motor planning.\n\nParticipants in the study will be randomized to one of two treatment groups, receiving either testosterone gel or placebo, for 12 months. 60% of the study group will receive testosterone, and 40% will receive placebo.\n\nThe research participants, parents/caregivers, and the members of the study team will be blinded to the treatment group, and will not know whether they are receiving testosterone gel or placebo treatments.\n\nThe supervising endocrinologist for the study will not be blinded and will know which patients are in the testosterone and placebo groups. This will allow him to monitor results to determine if participants in the placebo group may develop a significant need for testosterone therapy during the study period. If this occurs, the patient will be switched to the testosterone group and will continue to be monitored in the study.\n\nAll participants will be evaluated at the beginning of the study and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.

      "description": "The bone marrow mononuclear cell fraction has been used as therapy after myocardial infarction and in dilated cardiomyopathy in adults. The absence of adult co-morbidities may enhance the potential effectiveness of pediatric stem cells.This study is a randomized, crossover, placebo controlled pilot study to primarily determine the safety and feasibility of stem cell intracoronary therapy in children. Secondary end points are MRI measurements and NTproBNP.\n\nTen children (mean age 7.2 years, range 2.2-14.1, 6 male) with dilated cardiomyopathy (NYHA/ Ross Classification 2-4) will be recruited. Bone marrow aspiration MRI and cell injection are performed under the same anaesthetic. Patients will be crossed over at 6 months.",
      "detailedDescription": "This pilot study is of a randomized, crossover, placebo controlled design. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement was used to guide the development of the protocol. Ethical Approval was obtained for this project in April 2008.\n\nA CONSORT flow diagram was produced and a project plan for a crossover study designed. Although the primary end point of the study was safety and feasibility the investigator aimed to look at functional outcome as a secondary endpoint. Statistical review of the available literature indicated a 3% change in ejection fraction (EF) as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would represent a meaningful change and calculated 10 patients would be sufficient to detect this mean change in EF, assuming a SD of difference of 3% with 80% power and 5% significance. For all calculations it was assumed that the distribution of differences was Normal. Calculation of a sample size for the crossover study required a definition of the minimum difference to be detected.\n\nChildren aged 1 year to 16 years at review, either attending Heart Failure Clinic at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) or referred for admission and management of their heart failure at GOSH will be invited to participate in the study. The lower age limit was selected to permit coronary artery catheterisation to be feasibly performed taking into account the size of the patient.\n\nOn recruitment all patients have impaired systolic function as determined by reduced shortening fraction on echocardiogram (more than 2 SD below normal). The functional status of the recruited patients was class 2-4 as defined by the NYHA or Ross classification.\n\nExclusion criteria were the need for high dependency or intensive care and congenital heart disease, viral infection that would preclude the use of hospital Cell Therapy Laboratory facilities, active malignancy and unstable cardiac drug therapy.\n\nPotential patients will be identified from case notes, and they and their families approached either by telephone or following clinic review to evaluate their interest in participation. Any patients who appeared interested in participating in the study will be given age and language appropriate written information; and also given a contact telephone numberso that additional information could be supplied if required. Each family will be given the opportunity to discuss the study with the research team before consent for inclusion was obtained.\n\nProtocol:\n\nTen patients who met the eligibility criteria will be recruited for this study. Each patient is randomized at entry to the study to determine whether they would receive stem cells at Period One or Period Two of the protocol. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated random number table, Graph pad.\n\nFollowing recruitment and randomisation, patients have their individual admission time-line planned. Those patients who are to receive stem cells at their first study admission are reviewed within the 28 days preceding that date. At this review, screening for infection, as per our hospital Cell Therapy Laboratory protocol (including HIV and hepatitis B and C) will be performed, following full written consent.\n\nOn the day of the procedure the patient will be admitted to the cardiac day-care facility for baseline observations and clinical assessment. The study procedure will be performed in the Cardiac MRI theatre under general anaesthetic. Blood samples will be taken at the time of anaesthesia for routine investigation (full blood count, urea, electrolytes, liver function and NTproBNP).\n\nThose patients receiving intracoronary stem cells at this admission have 20mL of bone marrow aspirated from the posterior iliac crest under aseptic conditions immediately after induction of anaesthesia.\n\nBone marrow aspiration technique:\n\nThose patients on anticoagulation therapy are highlighted in advance of all procedures and admissions, and optimal coagulation management implemented prior to, during and following the bone marrow aspiration. All bone marrow processing is undertaken at the Great Ormond Street Hospital cell therapy processing facility.\n\nFollowing anaesthetic induction and the securing of a stable airway the patient is positioned to permit bone marrow aspiration. Full aseptic conditions are observed throughout the procedure. A volume of 20 mL of bone marrow is aspirated from a single needle puncture site using heparinized 10mL syringes attached to the bone marrow needle following removal of the central trocar. The aspirated bone marrow is transferred to sterile heparinized universal specimen bottles. Immediately after aspiration the bone marrow sample is taken to the cell therapy laboratory for mononuclear cell separation using standard techniques of gradient centrifugation.\n\nThe mononuclear cell separation protocol takes approximately 90 minutes to complete. The bone marrow sample is processed to provide 1mL for intra-coronary injection and 1mL to be cryogenically frozen for further phenotypic analysis at a later date. A small aliquot of stem cell suspension is analysed to obtain total mononuclear cell counts per millilitres. This cell count represents the total number of mononuclear cells injected via intra-coronary catheterisation. In addition cell viability was also assessed.\n\nWhilst waiting for the prepared stem cells, the cardiac MRI scan is performed using a breath hold protocol for image acquisition. Following the MRI scan the patient is transferred by means of the mechanized sliding table back into the angiography suite.\n\nOn return to the angiography suite the patient is maintained under general anaesthesia until notice is given by the stem cell laboratory that the stem cell processing is nearing completion. Following contact with the stem cell laboratory an arterial sheath is placed in the femoral artery of the study patient and advanced until its tip is sited in the left main coronary artery. Partial occlusion of the coronary artery was observed as demonstrated by ST segment changes and damping of the pressure trace is routinely monitored during such procedures. The 1mL volume is slowly injected via the coronary artery catheter into the left main coronary artery followed by a 1mL 0.9% saline flush over a period of 2 minutes.\n\nFollowing the intracoronary injection of stem cell suspension the cardiac catheter is removed and haemostasis at the skin entry site achieved. The patient is then woken and recovered in a standard manner.\n\nPatients are admitted to the cardiac ward overnight with routine monitoring of the arterial catheterisation access site and bone marrow aspiration site; cardiac care observations are continued throughout. Patients are discharged the following day and electively reviewed in the outpatient's clinic at three months post-procedure or advised to contact the Research Fellow sooner if any concerns.\n\nCross-over of interventions occurs at six months with the stem cell group receiving placebo via the cardiac catheterisation (no bone marrow harvest is required for the placebo arm of the study) on the second occasion. The same admission, monitoring and follow up will be arranged as for the stem cell stage of the study. The placebo used for the intracoronary injection used is 1mL 0.9% saline, consistent with the placebo solution used in adult studies. The 1mL of placebo is followed with a 1mL 0.9% saline flush for correlation with the stem cell arm of the study. An interim clinic review is again arranged at three months post procedure and a follow up cardiac MRI scan at six months. The time scale was chosen after review of the available adult literature which showed that effects on the left ventricle were usually seen within 6 months.\n\nThose patients randomly allocated placebo at stage one of the study cross over to receive stem cells at stage two. Interim and final follow up arrangements are the same for the stem cell and placebo groups.\n\nAnaesthesia was standardized for all patients and the same anaesthetist used for all procedures. Bone marrow preparation was also standardized and performed by the same scientist in each case. Computer data entry will be double-checked. Patient identifiers are removed from the anonymous images to allow blind analysis later on; in this way unbiased image analysis is performed. A single researcher using Osirix software performs off-line analysis of the data. As a second check of these data the researcher's results are evaluated, again blind to patient identifiers, by a second analyser. The key to the blinding of the MRI data is devised, applied and stored securely by a clinician not otherwise involved in the study. Indexed values correct the data for age, sex, height and weight and permit true comparisons to be made between the series of studies of the same individual and between different individuals.\n\nPrimary outcome measures:\n\nThe primary outcome measures were freedom from death and transplantation or any complication which could be considered related to bone marrow injection or anaesthesia (infection/malignancy/anaphylaxis/renal deterioration). A safety monitoring committee, including a cardiologist from Great Ormond Street Hospital not involved in the trial, an external cardiologist and a lay representative, will be established. Any adverse events will be reported to the committee which was empowered to halt the trial at any time if concerns arose.\n\nSecondary outcome measures:\n\nEjection fraction, left ventricular volumes and mass are derived from cardiac MRI. Blood is taken for NT proBNP. In addition functional status is assessed by the New York Heart Association classification or the Ross classification in younger children.\n\nEach patient has a cardiac MRI under general anaesthetic. The anaesthetist and anaesthesia protocol are the same for all patients.\n\nAll images are obtained with a 1.5-T MR scanner (Avanto, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using a 12-element phased-array coil for signal reception and the body coil for signal transmission. A vector ECG system is used for cardiac gating.\n\nLeft ventricular (LV) volumes are measured from contiguous short-axis steady state free precession cine covering both ventricles (7-13 slices, depending on the size of the child). Each slice is acquired in a single 10- to 15-second breath hold as previously described. All image processing is performed using in-house plug-ins for the open-source Osirix DICOM (digital imaging and communications in medicine) software. The LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) and end-systolic volume (ESV) are measured by manual segmentation of the endocardial borders in the short-axis data. Careful segmentation of the basal slices in conjunction with 4-chamber and LV long-axis views is performed to overcome problems with delineating the mitral valve. Ventricular stroke volume (SV) was the difference between the EDV and ESV, and ventricular ejection fraction (%) was (SV/EDV)\u00d7100.\n\nFor each of the secondary end points, EDV, ESV and EF, comparisons between treatments are made on an intention to treat basis. A crossover analysis on post treatment measures is conducted using an analysis of variance model, considering sequence, period and treatment effects. Carry-over effect is tested first and where there is no evidence of a significant effect, the treatment effect is tested. A subsequent generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was fitted which allowed for an adjustment for baseline measures.\n\nWhere the distribution of the data was clearly non-Normal the investigators use a logarithmic transformation. Stata is used for all statistical analyses and all tests were two-sided. A P value \\< 0.05 was considered significant.",

      "description": "The goal of this trial is to study the effect that adrenaline has on the immune reaction seen during a low blood sugar. People with type 1 diabetes do not produce their own insulin. The cells in the pancreas that produce insulin are destroyed. People with type 1 diabetes require daily insulin administration. As a consequence of this insulin therapy the blood sugar can dip too low, causing symptoms such as confusion, irritation and tiredness. This is called hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycaemia has been associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease such as heart attacks. During hypoglycaemia the immune system is activated. The immune system consists of white blood cells which produce cytokines, these are proteins used to kill pathogens such as bacteria. During hypoglycaemia there are no pathogens but the cytokines are still produced, leading to unwanted damage. A previous study performed by our research group showed that the immune system activation caused by hypoglycaemia is associated with the stress hormone adrenaline. Adrenaline is released by the body in moments of stress such as during running or bungee jumping. Adrenaline is also released by the body during hypoglycaemia to increase the sugar level. Our hypothesis is that adrenaline activates the immune system during hypoglycaemia. Adrenaline acts in the body through two receivers, these are called alpha and beta receptors. These are present on almost all cells in the body especially on the immune cells. With the study we want to study the situation where there is a hypoglycaemia without the adrenaline. We will achieve this by lowering the blood sugar in participants. During the low blood sugar we will administer two drugs, which will attach themselves to the adrenaline receivers, the alpha and beta receptor. With this method we hope to block the adrenaline effects and with that block the immune response caused by adrenaline.",
      "detailedDescription": "Rationale: Hypoglycaemia has shown to cause a sustained pro-inflammatory response which could promote a pro-atherogenic state and explain the association between hypoglycaemia and cardiovascular events. This pro-inflammatory response has been linked to the adrenaline response to hypoglycaemia. Adrenergic blockade with \u03b1 and \u03b2 adrenergic receptor antagonists (ARA) has shown to blunt the leukocyte response after hypoglycaemia induction and adrenaline administration. Whether and to what degree a combined blockade blunts the hypoglycaemia induced pro-inflammatory response is unknown.\n\nObjective: to examine the effect of adrenergic inhibition on the hypoglycaemia induced inflammatory response (e.g. leukocyte phenotype, cytokines, inflammatory proteins) by performing a hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemic glucose clamp alongside infusion of \u03b1-ARA and \u03b2-ARA. Secondary objectives consist of the effect of adrenergic blockade during hypoglycaemia on atherogenic parameters and glucose metrics ( e.g. time in range).\n\nStudy design: Intervention study with a cross-over design\n\nStudy population: Potentially eligible adult ( 16 - 75 years) participants will be recruited through social media, the Radboudumc outpatient clinic and other advertisements. We will recruit a total of 24 individuals, i.e. 12 healthy participants and 12 participants with type 1 diabetes. Participants with type 1 diabetes will be twice ( as there are two investigational days) equipped with a blinded continuous glucose monitoring device (CGM) during the test, which will measure interstitial glucose levels for a total of 10 days.\n\nIntervention: All participants will undergo a hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemic glucose clamp ( nadir 2.8 mmol/L). During the clamp the participants will be randomized to receive an infusion of saline or an infusion of phentolamine and propranolol. This will be done using a cross-over design. The participants will undergo both the saline and adrenergic blockade.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameter will be the monocyte count after 60 minutes hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemic clamp and adrenergic blockade during the clamp.",

Even though the risk of major bleeding with VKAs may be lower in patients already challenged to anticoagulation treatment. 3 Furthermore, when deciding on longer term secondary prevention of VTE, DOACs appeared safer than standard-intensity VKAs, taking clinically relevant bleeding or any bleeding into consideration.4-5 Until now there is no randomized controlled trial assessing the role of oral direct anticoagulant as a prophylaxis for catheter associated venous thromboembolism.\n\nAim of the work: To evaluate the efficacy of direct oral anticoagulants as a prophylactic anticoagulation in thromboprophylaxis of catheter induced thrombosis.\n\nPatients and methods Study location: The study will be conducted at the department of vascular surgery in Mansoura University, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura, Egypt .\n\nType of study: Randomized Controlled Prospective study Study duration: 2 years: 2022-2024 Sample size: It will include all patients presented to our department fulfilling the inclusion criteria.\n\nStudy population: The study will be conducted in patients with any permanent catheter inserted intravenous either femoral or jugular either for hemodialysis or replacement therapy .\n\nInclusion criteria: Any permanent catheter inserted intravenous either femoral or jugular either for hemodialysis, replacement or chemotherapy.\n\nExclusion criteria: History of central venous occlusion, contraindication of direct oral anticoagulants.\n\nConsent: Patients must sign informed consent about possible complications from the therapy.\n\nData collection: The demographics, symptoms, and preoperative clinical data will be collected.\n\nHistory Data: including underlying medical conditions, any previous associated morbidity.\n\nExamination: Venous examinations.

It is therefore a frequent pathology that can cause complications for both mother and child.\n\nThe complications both for the mother and for the mother-child bond. Indeed, post-partum depression can lead to an increased risk of infanticide, weaker mother-child attachment, and altered parental behaviour. post-partum depression can lead to maternal suicide (the second leading cause cause of maternal mortality in France). Despite the potential seriousness of severe depression and its impact on the on the mother-child bond, just under half of those suffering from severe depression suffering from severe depression consult a healthcare professional.\n\nFear of being judged or stigmatised, linked to misperceptions about the episode, is one of the main obstacles to consultation.\n\nOf being judged or stigmatised, linked to erroneous representations of the depressive episode. Given the scale of this condition, and the difficulties young mothers face in seeking help for young mothers to seek help, it is vital to screen postpartum women as widely and post-partum women as early as possible. In view of the extent of this condition and the difficulties young mothers have in seeking help for young mothers, it is vital to screen post-partum women as widely and as post-partum.

      "description": "The purpose of this study is to determine whether first-trimester screening for preeclampsia based on the FMF algorithm (a combination of maternal clinical, sonographic and biochemical parameters), improves maternal or perinatal health.",
      "detailedDescription": "Preeclampsia (PE) complicates 2% of pregnancies and is a leading cause of severe maternal and perinatal complications. There is no curative treatment, and the only recognized beneficial primary prevention is low-dose aspirin. Meta-analyses of randomized trials show that the administration of aspirin, started before 16 weeks of gestation (WG) and at the dosage of 100-160 mg/d in pregnant women at high risk of PE, is associated with a 50% to 60% reduction in the rates of PE, prematurity and perinatal mortality. The group of patients benefiting most from aspirin is pregnant women with a history of PE. That is why all guidelines recommend early preventive administration of aspirin in pregnant women with PE in a previous pregnancy. However, patients with a history of PE represent a small fraction of pregnant women, and PE mostly occurs in women who do not have a history of PE, especially nulliparas. Recently, several national societies decided to broaden the indications for aspirin prevention on the basis of the number of known maternal risk factors. These recommendations lead to a wide use of low-dose aspirin in up to 30% of pregnant women. In order to better target patients at risk of PE among all pregnant women, screening tests have been developed integrating clinical characteristics, uterine Doppler (UD) parameters and biomarkers in a single score. The study by Poon et al. paved the way for early detection of PE. An algorithm based on maternal characteristics, UD parameters and serum levels of PlGF and PAPP-A between 11 and 14 WG yielded detection rates of 93% and 36% for the prediction of early- and late-onset PE, respectively, at 5% false-positive rate (FPR), which were superior to the detection rates of the traditional checklist-based approach, which relies on maternal factors only. This algorithm developed by the Fetal Medicine Foundation (FMF) has since evolved and is now integrated in the combined test for PE screening known as the FMF triple test (a combination of maternal characteristics with mean arterial pressure (MAP), uterine artery pulsatility index (UtA-PI), and serum PlGF). In a subsequent study using a risk cutoff of 1 in 100 for the predicted probability of preterm PE, a screen-positive rate of 10% has been reported, with detection rates for early-onset, preterm, and term PE of 88%, 69%, and 40%, respectively.\n\nRecently, the ASPRE study evaluated the impact of aspirin in patients identified at high risk of PE on the basis of this FMF test. Screening was offered to 26,941 women and identified 2,641 high-risk patients of whom 1,776 were randomized to aspirin or placebo. This trial showed a reduction in the incidence of PE \\<37 WG, occurring in 13/798 in the aspirin group versus 35/822 in the placebo group (p=0.004), but with no significant effect on the overall rate of PE and most importantly on perinatal morbidity. Screening had to be applied to almost 27,000 women for a benefit of 22 avoided cases of preterm PE, with no demonstrated effect on the health of the women and children. The ASPRE study is important but does not demonstrate the benefit of routinely implementing PE screening in the general population. Indeed, there is currently no randomized study comparing a group of women to which the screening procedure would be applied to a group of women without screening, the only design able to provide strong evidence of a benefit. In addition, implementing a national screening program in pregnant women may induce adverse events, especially iatrogenicity (more hospitalizations, more ultrasound examinations, more consultations) and anxiety. Such a screening program is also associated with an increase of direct and indirect health costs.\n\nTo consider implementing screening for PE in the general population, it is then essential to demonstrate its benefits on robust health outcomes and not only on the PE diagnosis, as well as to assess its potential adverse consequences and costs. This evaluation is all the more crucial since it is currently offered to an increasing number of women.\n\nThe RANSPRE study will therefore be the first trial to test the impact on perinatal and maternal health outcomes of first-trimester screening for preeclampsia associated with aspirin treatment of pregnant women screened at risk. A medical and economic evaluation allowing a cost-effectiveness analysis will also be carried out. The results of this study will constitute essential information relevant to the health care system that will guide policymaking for the prevention of PE in the general population of pregnant women.\n\nThe primary objective of the study is to evaluate the impact of first-trimester PE screening (FTPS) on the incidence of severe perinatal morbidity. The primary outcome will be severe perinatal morbidity defined by a composite criterion including at least one of the following: perinatal mortality (stillbirth at or after 20 WG or neonatal death within 7 days of life) or prematurity \\<34 WG or birth weight \\<3\u00b0 percentile for gestational age.\n\nSecondary objectives are: (i) to evaluate the impact of first-trimester PE screening on: the incidence of preeclampsia, the incidence of components of moderate and severe maternal morbidity, the incidence of components of moderate and severe perinatal morbidity; (ii) to evaluate the impact of first-trimester PE screening on potential adverse events: iatrogenicity, over-medicalization, women's satisfaction and anxiety status; (iii) to evaluate the economic impact of first-trimester PE screening on costs.\n\nPatients will be recruited in 22 maternity centers at university hospitals in France. The inclusion period during pregnancy is between 11 WG and 14 WG. Eligible women will be identified in early pregnancy at their first prenatal visit in the maternity hospital, before or at the time of the first-trimester ultrasound. The FMF algorithm used in the study for PE screening is based on a combination of maternal clinical parameters (medical history, maternal characteristics, pregnancy characteristics, mean arterial pressure), sonographic parameters (uterine Doppler with measurement of mean pulsatility index) and biochemical parameters (PlGF concentration). Women agreeing to participate in the RANSPRE trial will be randomized either to the experimental group with first-trimester screening for PE or to the control group with usual care without screening for PE.\n\nAll patients will be asked to complete self-administered questionnaires at 20 (+/2) WG and during the postpartum period (within 30 days after delivery) assessing women's satisfaction and women's anxiety. These questionnaires will be collected for women included until 31/01/2025.. A notebook will be given to patients screened at risk and with aspirin prescription to monitor aspirin observance and to record potential side-effects related to aspirin.\n\nAn intention-to-treat analysis will be performed as the principal analysis.",

      "detailedDescription": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive imaging technique that allows physicians to visualize our anatomy, generating high-quality pictures of our body's internal structure at many different angles. The principle behind MRI, known as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), revolves around hydrogen atoms (or protons) that can be found everywhere in our entire body, such as in bones, blood, organs, skin, muscles and more. Protons have their own magnetic moment and angular momentum, allowing them to spin in a certain direction. By subjecting these spinning protons to a strong magnetic field they will be oriented along the axis of the magnetic field, either with or against the direction of the magnetic field. MRI machines generate this field using a large magnet surrounding the patient. Electric gradient coils allow the strength of the field to be adjustable, usually around 0,5 or 1,5 tesla.\n\nMRI has many advantages compared to other imaging techniques, i.e. CT (computed tomography), including the lack of radiation, the ability to show abnormalities of soft tissues, the ability to visualize blood flow, and contrasting agents that are less likely to cause adverse effects like allergic reactions. There are also some disadvantages or limitations, however: implants or metallic objects inside the body can make images unclear at best or harm the patient at worst; similarly, movements made by the patient can make images unclear as well. Lastly, MRI is a more expensive and slower technique compared to other imaging techniques.\n\nChildren undergoing an MRI are often sedated before being placed inside the machine. After the scan is over, the children will be brought to a recovery area, where they can slowly recover from the sedation until they are fully awake again. Some common side effects resulting from the sedation may be vomiting, drowsiness and/or dizziness.\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the indications and therapeutical consequences of MRI scans of (young) children undergoing risky remote anaesthesia. The investigators want to aim for a clear indication in children undergoing MRI in the future before undergoing possible unnecessary procedures and MRI scans.",

      "description": "Introduction: Cancer is the main public health problem in the world and is already among the main causes of death. Breast CA will be the second most common type of cancer in the Brazilian population between 2020-2022. The pandemic caused by COVID-19 brought several changes in society, affecting health services, one of which was the need to maintain regular treatment for various health conditions, such as cancer. Physical therapy is an essential part of the multidisciplinary treatment of cancer patients. With the new technologies available, it is possible to allow continuous treatment of cancer patients, even during quarantine, and one possibility is the application of information and communication technologies to provide rehabilitation therapy to remote people, called home telerehabilitation. Objective: To verify the effect of virtual reality (VR) training on motor performance, pain and heart rate variability variables in patients diagnosed with breast cancer. Methods: The study will be composed of 30 women over 18 years old with a diagnosis of breast cancer attended at an oncology physical therapy clinic in the city of Juiz de Fora - MG. Participants will undergo training using virtual reality technology, always guided by the researcher. There will be a total of 10 (ten) interventions, with two training sessions per week. The participant will be guided by a researcher who will instruct her online. Five games will be used: Reaction Time, Coincident Timing, Fitts, Genius, MoveHero. Participants will answer some questionnaires and scales such as EORTC QLQ-C30 which assesses quality of life in cancer patients, perceived exertion scale will be applied before and between matches, a mood scale (BRUMS) will be applied at the beginning and at the end of training and Affective Analog Face Scale for pain assessment and analysis of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) that will be performed before, during and after the first and last training, through a heart rate monitor that will be given to each participant and an application cell phone (Elite HRV).",
      "detailedDescription": "METHOD\n\n1. Study design and location This is a longitudinal study of the randomized clinical trial type. This study will be developed at the Hope Physiotherapy and Esthetics Clinic, headquartered and located in the city of Juiz de Fora, in the state of Minas Gerais.\n2. Participants Thirty individuals will participate in the study with a diagnosis of breast CA, previously confirmed by a specialist physician, who attend physiotherapy care at the Hope Physiotherapy and Esthetics clinic in the city of Juiz de Fora-MG, authorized by the owner (ANNEX I).\n\n   To calculate the sample size, an alpha value (probability of error type 1) of 5% was assumed for the two-tailed hypothesis, beta (probability of error type 2) of 20%, test power of 80% and a difference between groups of 10% referring to engine performance data. Thus, at least 30 individuals will be needed (Dodd et al., 2002).\n\n   All participants will be informed about the objectives and procedures of the study and, when they agree, will sign the Informed Consent Form (FICF). The study will be submitted to the Research Ethics Committee (CEP). Resolution 466/2012 of the National Health Council of 10/10/1996 which regulates research involving human beings and the Declaration of Helsinki (1964) will be respected. Data will be electronically stored in databases with restricted and secure access. All data will be encrypted with removal of any information that could identify individuals.\n3. Procedures Thirty women diagnosed with breast AC will be selected to analyze the effect on motor performance, pain, perceived exertion and HRV in interventions through VR.\n\n   Ten sessions will be applied (two sessions per week). Initially, the researcher will travel to the participant's residence with all the protective equipment necessary for the delivery of the heart rate capture straps, which will be inside a plastic bag disinfected with 70% alcohol and also to present the consent form and clarified to the participants, as well as the procedures and objectives of the study. After signing the consent form, the following information will be collected through online forms: age, gender, corresponding phase (such as chemotherapy, initial diagnosis, complications, relapse diagnosis), length of stay, associated diseases, medications in use, education . Then, the questionnaires will be applied to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), Brunel Mood Scale (BRUMS), BORG scale of perceived exertion, and Analog Affective Faces Scale.\n\n   Then, training with virtual reality will be carried out, in which the HRV will be captured (on days 1, 5 and 7) 10 minutes before performing the tasks in a virtual reality environment (at rest, sitting), for 15 minutes during the tasks in VR (MoveHero and Genius, according to item 5.4.2. D and E) and for another 10 minutes after (at rest, sitting), to assess the autonomic recovery of physical activity. In the 10 days, interventions in VR will be used (MoveHero and Genius and the Borg scale), the HRV and the other evaluations will be carried out on days 1, 5 and 10.\n\n   3.1. Physical Assessment Questionnaires and Tests A) European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) The general questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) includes 30 questions related to five functional scales (physical, functional, emotional, social and cognitive), a global health status scale, three symptom scales (fatigue, pain and nausea/vomiting ) and six additional symptom items (dyspnea, insomnia, loss of appetite, constipation, diarrhea and financial difficulties).\n\n   The score is obtained according to the type of answer chosen. The options allowed by the questionnaire are \"no\" (one point), \"little\" (two points), \"moderately\" (three points) or \"very\" (four points). In the two questions referring to the global health status scale, the options to choose from range from one (very bad) to seven points (very good). Questionnaire scores range from 0 to 100.\n\n   Regarding functional and global health status scales, higher scores are related to better quality of life; however, for the symptom scales, higher scores correspond to a greater presence of that symptom and, consequently, a worse quality of life (Appendix I).\n\n   B) Affective Analog Scale of Faces (FAS):\n\n   This scale assesses the affective magnitude of pain through 9 facial expressions that range from the feeling of joy to the feeling of sadness, which makes it possible to measure the absence of pain to a higher degree of pain (McGrath, 1996).\n\n   Facial expressions are sequentially ordered by the letter interval (AI), in which the AD interval represents the absence of pain, E represents the neutral point and the FI interval represents different degrees of pain intensities, with F being the easily ignored pain indication by the presence of family members, favorable environment, measures of comfort, safety and understanding of the professional; G an intensity of pain that does not interfere with behavior and can be mediated by the child's expression; There is an intensity of pain that interferes with behavior and requires the use of analgesics, and I an intensity in the maximum degree of pain that requires greater intervention by the team, observation of physical and psychological aspects, in addition to appropriate analgesic techniques (Torritesi et al., 1998).\n\n   Thus, individuals choose among the 9 faces, ordered in a scale from A to I, the one that most indicates the intensity of their pain.\n\n   C) Borg's perceived exertion scale:\n\n   It is the classification of perceived exertion used to measure the subjective intensity of exertion. It is based on sensations experienced during exercise, such as muscle fatigue, increased heart rate, and increased breathing (Andrews et al., 2013). It is often used as an alternative to heart rate to measure the intensity of physical activity (BORG, 1970). The Borg scale has a linear relationship with oxygen uptake (BORG, 1982), in addition to being a measure to determine exercise intensity, while evaluating the overall physical and mental effort perceived by the individual on physical activity (BORG, 1998).\n\n   D) Brunel Mood Scale (BRUMS):\n\n   It measures six identifiable affective states (tension, depression, anger, energy, fatigue and confusion.\n\n   use) through a 24-item self-report inventory, with respondents rating a list of adjectives on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (none) to 4 (extremely) based on subjective feelings. Instructions refer to how participants felt last week, including today's date (Van Wijk; Martin; Hans-Arendse, 2013).\n\n   3.2. Virtual Reality Training Participants will carry out the tasks individually in their homes with the help of a computer on a table and with the online presence of the evaluator responsible for providing instructions and recording the results. Height and distance adjustments will be made according to the individual's needs.\n\n   Before starting the task, the researcher will explain the task verbally and a video will be sent with a demonstration of how the game works. Participants will then complete a single trial to verify that they understand the instructions.\n\n   The following virtual games will be used: Reaction Time (3 adaptation attempts and 10 attempts for analysis), Coincident Timing (20 repetitions for motor skill acquisition and performance improvement), Coincident Timing (5 repetitions + 5 repetitions with level increase of speed for analysis of retention and transfer - motor learning), 5 repetitions for the transfer phase), Fitts (3 attempts in 4 different difficulty indexes), Genius (5 minutes of training with progressive increase in difficulty according to the number of correct answers of the participant), MoveHero (15 minutes of training with music according to the number of spheres selected).\n\n   A) Task 1 - Reaction time Reaction time is a task that consists of evaluating the time the subject spends to match his cognitive and motor response with the stimuli given on the computer screen.\n\n   The TRT_S2012 software, built and validated by Crocetta et al., 2017, will be used in a sample of 76 healthy adults. The Software proposes a Simple Total Reaction Time (TRT) test, which consists of the appearance of a yellow square (parameterizable) in the center of the monitor at previously defined time intervals (ranging from 1.5 to 6.5 ms) and, when given the stimulus, the participant should react as quickly as possible, pressing the space bar on the computer keyboard.\n\n   In this activity, the milliseconds that the subject presents of anticipation or delay of movement in response to the stimulus will be recorded. This task will test the speed of central and peripheral information processing and will be used in this study as an instrument to assess cognitive motor training.\n\n   The Software also allows a Mental Fatigue Assessment Test from the TRT (TRT Fatigue). In this test, the stimulus consists of the appearance of a yellow bar that started at a time previously defined as the interval between stimuli (IEE), following a shift, from left to right. As an indication prior to the appearance of the stimulus, a thin vertical bar in black color, simulating a cursor, was presented until the yellow color filled the stimulus bar. The reaction should be to press the space key at the moment the yellow stimulus bar is perceived. The space key must be held down while the yellow color is shown. When the yellow stimulus is stopped, the space key must be released. Yellow stimulus presentation times were previously defined as stimulus presentation time (TAE). This activity will be used in this study as an instrument to assess cognitive motor training.\n\n   B) Task 2 - Coincident Timing The coincident timing task is defined as the perceptual-motor capacity to execute a motor response in synchrony with the arrival of an external object, at a certain point (Belisle, 1963). This is an interception task that involves synchrony between eye and hand movements, requires a movement start, deceleration and \"stop\" strategy, in addition to accuracy and precision (Fooken et al., 2016; Ohta, 2016). The execution of this first protocol will be performed with the Coincident Timing task using the touchscreen (touch the computer screen).\n\n   To evaluate the virtual task, we chose to use a software developed in partnership with the Information Systems group of the School of Arts, Sciences and Humanities, EACH-USP (first version used by Monteiro et al., 2014) which proposes the 3D coincident timing task on the computer. This activity will be used in this study as an instrument to assess cognitive motor training.\n\n   In the virtual environment, 10 3D circles are displayed on the computer screen that light up (red light) in sequence until reaching the last circle that is considered the target. The participant must touch the computer screen exactly at the moment when the last sphere lights up, so the goal is to match the touch on the screen exactly above the last lit circle (target circle). The software provides immediate feedback on the task's success or error through different sounds and colors, previously demonstrated (Monteiro et al., 2014, 2017; Bezerra et al., 2018). If the participant hits the target at the same time as the stimulus arrives, a green light will turn on around the task - hit feedback, however if the participant delays or advances the movement, a red light will turn on next to the task - feedback from error. The game shows the sequence and speed of lighting the cubes and records the total time of task execution (time taken to touch the sensor); existing errors between stimulus arrival and task completion.\n\n   In the design of the coincident timing study, each participant will perform 20 attempts of the task with the dominant upper limb at moderate speed, that is, 500ms between the lighting of each circle for the Acquisition phase. After acquisition, participants will wait at rest for 5 minutes and then perform five attempts in the Retention phase. As it is considered a simple task, we chose to use short-term retention (Monteiro et al., 2014 and Malheiros et al., 2016). For the Transfer phase, five more attempts will be made with increased speed, that is, 250ms between the lighting of each circle.\n\n   Performance during acquisition, retention and transfer tasks will be evaluated considering the difference between target firing time and sensor touch. For this purpose, performance measures will be used as those related to achieving the \"task-coincidence\" goal: Constant Error, which reflects the directional trend of the movement, being of delay or anticipation of the response, and calculated using the arithmetic mean of the differences between performance and goal, considering their signs; Absolute Error, which corresponds to the accuracy with which the target of the action was reached, calculated through the arithmetic mean of the absolute differences between the actual performance in each attempt and the target; and Variable Error that identifies the precision of the movement, performing the calculation of each attempt, considering the signs, minus the average of the first five attempts for each participant, then the values are raised to the second power and to the average of each five attempts, extract the square root (Santos et al., 2003).\n\n   C) Task 4 - Fitts The software that simulates the task is \"FittsReciprocalAimingTask v.1.0 (Horizontal)\", in the public domain (http://okazaki.webs.com - available from the internet on 09/01/2010) (Fernani et al., 2017) and was developed by Victor Hugo Alves Okazaki who presents the task proposed by Fitts' law in a virtual (computer) environment. This activity will be used in this study as an instrument to assess cognitive motor training.\n\n   The task that assesses the speed and precision of movement relationship, based on Fitts' Law, consists of performing manual movements directed at a target (blue bars), in 3 difficulty indices (ID) with increasing demands for precision. The movement time is obtained through the division between pre-established seconds for the task (10) and the number of touches performed on the target.\n\n   Before starting the task, the performer must place one of his hands on the mouse, and the cursor (viewed on the computer) must be in an intermediate point between the two targets (sidebars). After the initial position, the performer must use the mouse to move the cursor and click on the targets, two bars, which are arranged parallel vertically, with dimensions and distance determined according to each iID, alternately and as quickly as possible , after the audible alarm is triggered by the computer to start the task. After 10 seconds a new audible alarm indicates the end of the task. The total movement time will be recorded, obtained by dividing pre-established seconds for the task (10) and the number of touches (10/number of touches).\n\n   The task consists of three attempts in each of the difficulty indices (ID 2, ID4a, ID4b and ID6), with each index changing the width and distance of the bars with an increasing level of difficulty. ID4 was applied in two ways (ID4a and ID4b): in ID4a the distance and width of bars are larger, in ID4b the distance between bars and width are smaller, keeping the same ID.\n\n   For data analysis, the relationship between speed and accuracy of movement described by the mathematical equation proposed by Fitts will be considered, where there is a log-linear relationship between movement time and task difficulty, with targets of varying sizes and distances requiring different times to reach goals (Boyd et al., 2009).\n\n   As the size of the target is reduced, or as the distance becomes greater, the movement speed decreases so that the movement is accurate. Due to the intrinsic information between the tathe target (D) and the distance between them (L), the log2 equation (2D/L) provides a difficulty index (DI) for the targeting skills where, the higher the ID, the more difficult the task. More difficult tasks will require more movement time (Fitts, 1954).\n\n   D) Task 5 - Genius Game software created in partnership with the Information Systems group of the School of Arts, Sciences and Humanities, EACH-USP, will be used. Among the different games presented by the software, a game that allows motor and cognitive stimuli was chosen, the game presents a memory task where a sequence of colors is emitted by the computer (task based on the game commercially known as \"Genius\") so that the individual then repeat in order to obtain the correct sequence generated. The level of difficulty increases with each hit of the subject. The virtual interface provides reporting of reaction time and time between touches of each button.\n\n   This activity will be used in this study as an instrument to assess memory performance as well as a component of cognitive motor training.\n\n   E) Task 6 - MoveHero Software developed at the School of Arts, Sciences and Humanities of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo will also be used. The game features balls that fall, in four imaginary columns on the computer screen, in the rhythm of a song chosen by the researcher. The task is not to let the balls fall. However, the balls can only be touched when they reach four circles placed in parallel (at two levels of height), two to the left and two to the right of the participant (0 0 \\\\o/ 0 0), called targets 1, 2 , 3 and 4 as viewed from left to right.\n\n   The game captures the participant's movements through a webcam, not requiring physical contact to perform the task, so the participant must move their arms, at a distance of one and a half meters from the computer screen, or through the touch screen that requires contact on the computer screen in the inner space of the drawn circles. The participant must wait for the balls to fall, until they start to overlap one of the target circles. Therefore, the game requires the participant to have a strategy of anticipating movement to reach the balls within these circles.\n\n   The game offers hit feedback through a numbering (+1) that appears next to the sphere that is successfully hit inside the target, in addition, the total score is visible in the upper left corner of the screen, with 10 points for each right.\n\n   This activity will be used in this study as a memory performance assessment instrument as well as a component of cognitive motor training.\n\n   3.3. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) The analysis of the HRV will follow the guidelines of the Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology (TFESC \\& NASPE, 1996).\n\n   The volunteers will be instructed (online) to put on the collection belt given to them. The strap should be placed on the chest, and the heart rate receiver (Elite HRV app on the cell phone) will be positioned close to the volunteer. The HRV will be recorded after the initial assessment at rest for 10 minutes, during training with virtual reality for 10 minutes and for 10 minutes after the activity in VR. For analysis of HRV data at rest and during tasks, 256 consecutive RR intervals will be used.\n\n   HR will be recorded beat by beat throughout the protocol by Elite HRV and the RR intervals recorded by the monitor will be transferred (.txt file) to the Kubios HRV\u00ae program (Kubios HRV v.1.1 for Windows, Biomedical Signal Analysis Group, Department of Applied Physics, University of Kuopio, Finland).\n\n   Digital filtering will be performed in moderate mode in the program itself (Kubios HRV\u00ae) to eliminate premature ectopic beats and artifacts, and only series with more than 95% of sinus beats will be included in the study (Vanderlei et al., 2008).\n\n   The analysis of HRV will be performed using linear methods (time and frequency domains) and through non-linear methods that will be analyzed using the Kubios HRV\u00ae software.\n\n   A) Linear Methods (Time and Frequency Domain) In the time domain, the RMSSD, pNN50 and SDNN indexes will be used. The RMSSD index is defined as the square root of the mean square of the differences between adjacent normal RR intervals. (Mar\u00e3es et al., 2003).\n\n   Where: RR = R-R intervals; N = number of RR intervals in the selected data series.\n\n   The pNN50 index, in turn, is a sensitive and easily interpretable marker of parasympathetic SNA modulation, defined as the percentage of successive differences in the R-R interval whose absolute value exceeds 50ms. The SDNN, on the other hand, reflects the participation of both ANS branches and corresponds to the standard deviation of the mean of all normal RR intervals, expressed in ms (Pumprla et al., 2002; Ribeio and Moraes Filho, 2005; Vanderlei et al., 2009).\n\n   For the analysis of HRV in the frequency domain, low frequency spectral components (LF - range from 0.04 to 0.15 Hertz) in absolute units and high frequency (HF - variation range from 0.15 to 0.4) will be used Hertz), in normalized units, and the ratio between these components (LF/HF), which represents the relative value of each spectral component in relation to the total power, minus the very low frequency components (VLF). The algorithm used for the spectral analysis will be the fast Fourier transform - FFT (256 s window with 50% overlap).\n\n   To obtain the spectral indices, a graph (tachogram) is formed that expresses the variation of RR intervals as a function of time. The tachogram contains an apparently periodic signal that oscillates in time and is processed by mathematical algorithms such as the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The FFT method is used to obtain an estimate of HRV spectral power during stationary phases of the experiment in order to allow comparisons between study results. It allows the tachogram signal to be recovered even after transformation by the FFT, which demonstrates the objectivity of the technique, since information is not lost during the process. The ease of application of this method and good graphical presentation are the main reasons for its greater use (Carvalho, 2009; Vanderlei et al., 2009).\n\n   B) Nonlinear Methods (Trends Debugged Fluctuations Analysis and Poincar\u00e9 Graph) For the analysis of HRV by non-linear methods, the Poincar\u00e9 graph (components SD1, SD2 and SD1/SD2 ratio), DFA (Trends Debugged Fluctuation Analysis) will be used.\n\n   The DFA quantifies the presence or absence of fractal correlation properties of RR intervals and has been validated by time series data. This method calculates the root mean square fluctuation of the integral and debugs the time series, allowing detection of the intrinsic self-similarity embedded in the non-stationary time series.\n\n   The DFA plot is not strictly linear, but consists of two distinct regions of distinct curves, separated by a point, suggesting that there is a short-term fractal scale exponent (\u03b11) during periods of 4-11 beats (or 4 to 13), and a long-term exponent (\u03b12), for longer periods (greater than 11 beats) (Carvalho et al, 2009).\n\n   Values of \u03b11 close to 0.5 are associated with white noise (random signal; there is no correlation between values), while values close to 1.5 are associated with Brownian noise (strongly correlated behavioral signals). Values close to 1.0 are characteristic of fractal-like processes associated with the dynamic behavior of time series generated by complex systems, such as the autonomic regulation of sinus rhythm in a healthy subject (Godoy et al., 2007).\n\n   The Poincar\u00e9 Graph, on the other hand, is a quantitative method of analysis, based on changes in the sympathetic or parasympathetic modulation of heart rate over subsequent intervals, without the need for the data stationarity property. The Poincar\u00e9 is a diagram where each RR interval is represented as a function of RR (i-T), where i is the interval and T is a predefined delay used for an RR signal. Visual inspection of the diagram has been widely used in the analysis of HRV, where the Poincar\u00e9 diagram can be analyzed quantitatively to calculate the standard deviations of the RR interval distances. These standard deviations are called SD1 and SD2. This analysis does not require pre-processing or data stability, which makes it especially interesting (Godoy et al., 2007).\n\n   For quantitative analysis of the plot, the following indices will be calculated: SD1 (standard deviation of instantaneous beat-to-beat variability in the short term), SD2 (long-term standard deviation of continuous RR intervals) and the SD1/SD2 ratio (Brunetto et al ., 2005). The qualitative analysis of the plot will be done through the analysis of the figures formed by its attractor, which were described by Tulppo et al. (1998) in: 1) Figure in which an increase in the dispersion of RR intervals is observed with an increase in the intervals, characteristic of a normal plot. 2) Figure with small global beat-to-beat dispersion and no long-term increase in RR interval dispersion. 3) Complex or parabolic figure, in which two or more distinct edges are separated from the main body of the plot, with at least three points included at each edge.\n4. Data analysis For data analysis descriptive statistics will be performed to characterize the sample and the results will be presented with mean and standard deviation values.\n\n   For inferential analysis of tasks in VR, as dependent variables, for \"Coincident Timing\" and \"MoveHero\" the error measures in milliseconds will be considered (Constant errors that evaluate the directional trend of the movemento, Absolute that demonstrates the accuracy of movement and Variable that identifies the precision of the movement), for TR the time and milliseconds, for Genius the number of sequences performed at the beginning and end of the task time, as well as the time between each touch the spheres.\n\n   For Fitts, the analysis will be performed by obtaining the values of b0 (intercept), b1 (inclination) and r2 (index of determination) for each participant, considering each attempt in the three difficulty indices. The MANOVA One-way will be used to compare the means of the groups in the three variables of interest (b0, b1 and r2). To verify associations between performance on the motor scale, age, slope of the straight line (b1), intercept (b0) and movement time dispersion data (r2), Pearson's correlation coefficient will be used. ANOVA will be performed to explore the effects of the difficulty index on movement time (TM) and multiple regression analysis to find which factors influence the TM.\n\n   For the analysis of the HRV indices, the Student t-test or Mann-Whitney test will also be used for intergroup analyses.\n\n   To analyze the influence of independent variables (age, disease stage, medications, etc.) on the dependent variables, the linear regression test will be performed.\n\n   A significance level of 0.05 (5%) will be defined and all intervals constructed throughout the work will have 95% of statistical confidence.\n\n   The statistical program will be SPSS (StatisticalPackage for Social Sciences), version 26.0.\n5. Dissemination and evaluation VR results regarding motor function, pain and HRV will be analyzed through descriptive and inferential statistical analysis and disseminated in scientific articles, which will be sent to specific journals in the area with a high impact factor.\n\nFurthermore, the results will be presented in book chapters and at international conferences. Thus, health and education professionals will have more scientific evidence to guide their activities in patients with AC.",

      "detailedDescription": "The incidence of septic shock complicated with tachycardia is high and the prognosis is poor. Enough attention should be paid to and appropriate treatment should be given. High heart rate and high cardiac output are beneficial compensatory reactions of sepsis and septic shock. However, excessive sympathetic activation and high heart rate also have adverse effects on the cardiovascular system. Sustained tachycardia is harmful to patients with sepsis and septic shock and needs to be controlled. At present, it is widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and \u03b2 Receptor blockers have the functions of preventing and reversing sympathetic effects, anti arrhythmia, anti-inflammatory and balancing myocardial oxygen supply and demand. Therefore, they are recommended to control arrhythmias in patients with septic shock. The 2014 guidelines for sepsis / septic shock in China suggest that if cardiac output is not low and the heart rate is fast after adequate fluid resuscitation, short acting drugs\uff08\u03b2 Receptor blockers\uff09can be considered. However, there are some differences in the current clinical research results, and it suggests that the timing of treatment may affect the hemodynamic results and clinical outcomes of patients.\n\nTherefore, this study intends to intervene with esmolol in patients with septic shock and tachycardia at different stages, and compare the hemodynamic parameters, clinical outcome, prognosis and adverse reactions with the conventional treatment group, in order to explore the appropriate time of esmolol in the treatment of patients with septic shock and tachycardia.",

Data will be extracted from SPOR on a yearly basis and results will be reported on selected cohorts (time periods and/or type of surgical procedure) during the study period.\n\nThere is an option for hospitals to register nausea and vomiting occurring at the recovery unit and submit the data to SPOR. If a hospital choose to use the variable in their dataset, all patients at their unit needs to be registered either with \\[No_Nausea or Vomiting\\], \\[Nausea\\] or \\[Nausea or Vomiting\\]. In the year 2019, more than 50% of procedures under anesthesia in the registry had registration of PONV. The strength with this system is that if a unit uses the variable, all cases will be classified either as \"noPONV\" or \"PONV\".\n\nThe investigators aim to use the variable PONV at the recovery unit to describe the risk for early PONV and explore associated factors in several cohorts of surgical procedures in Sweden.\n\nThe first dataset (2016-2018) was sent to the investigators from the SPOR registry in May 2019 and during the period June 2019- May 2020, the dataset was used to build up a model for the analysis of data with a preliminary report of elective surgeries in Sweden the year 2017.\n\nAn updated dataset (all cases 2016-2019) was retrieved from SPOR on June 3 2020 and further analysis and reporting is based on the most updated dataset (yearly basis).",

      "detailedDescription": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterized by a breakdown of tolerance against nuclear antigens. Thanks to improvements during the last decades in diagnosis, therapeutics and medical care, the lifespan of SLE patients has remarkably increased. However, standardized mortality ratio are still high in this population, with an increased mortality and morbidity associated with cardiovascular events and infectious events. Interestingly, these conditions are more commonly found during old age in the general population, raising the question of the presence of an acceleration of the aging process in SLE patients.\n\nIt has been demonstrated that the aging of the immune system, i.e. immunosenescence, is a key player in the development of many age-related diseases. The acceleration of immunosenescence, as it is observed during chronic viral infections for example, could favor the premature occurrence of clinical manifestations of accelerated aging. The exact contribution of such phenomenon in the context of SLE has, so far, never been explored.\n\nHere, the investigators propose to perform a comprehensive study of the phenomena of immune system aging in patients with SLE in comparison to age-matched healthy controls.\n\nThe study will recruit 50 SLE patients followed in Bordeaux University Hospital. Among classical disease activity information, blood samples will be collected at study visit to extensively evaluate immune system aging. Fundamental research will be realized on patients' samples. Patients will be included within their usual follow-up. No extra visit will be needed, and blood samples will be drawn at the same time as those drawn for clinical purposes.",

      "detailedDescription": "Although pain in laparoscopic procedures has been demonstrated to be inferior to that of laparotomic ones, it is still produced because of rapid distension of peritoneum, visceral manipulation, irritation and traction of vessels and phrenic nerves, presence of residual gas and inflammatory mediators.\n\nAnalgesia can be achieved with multimodal techniques, which include oral or intravenous drugs as well as loco-regional anesthesia techniques.\n\nThe abdominal wall has three muscle layers: external and internal obliques, and transversus abdominis. They are innervated by mixed somatic nerves that course between the transversus abdominis and the internal oblique muscles.\n\nTransversus Abdominis Plane Block is a regional analgesia technique which consists of injecting local anaesthetics between the transversus abdominis and internal oblique muscles, providing analgesia to the parietal peritoneum, skin and muscles of the anterior abdominal wall. It can provide benefit in both open and laparoscopic procedures and it is a safe technique, with a very low reported rate of complications.\n\nThree major techniques are used to perform the Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) block-a landmark-based, an ultrasound-guided, and a surgical- placed TAP block.\n\nAlthough the landmark technique is easy to perform, it might be complicated by inadvertent intraperitoneal organ damage.\n\nSurgically administered Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) blocks have been performed by surgeons intraoperatively using the transperitoneal approach, accessing the Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) from the inside of the abdominal wall. Direct visualization of the needle and local anaesthetic spread may help to increase the accuracy as well as eliminating the risk of intraabdominal organ injury and is technically less difficult. It is however necessarily placed after incision and pneumoperitoneum establishment.\n\nUltrasound-guided Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) block on the other side can be performed prior to incision and pneumoperitoneum, thus avoiding nociception from the very beginning.\n\nAim of the present prospective, randomised, single center controlled study is to compare postoperative analgesic efficacy of laparo-assisted vs ultrasound-guided Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) block in pediatric laparoscopic procedures. Primary outcome will be the comparison of pain scores between groups upon arrival to Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU).\n\nSecondary outcomes are:\n\n* pain scores at 1 and 6 hours after surgery\n* general anesthesia requirements, as defined by Minimum Alveolar Concentration-hour (MAC_hour)\n* intraoperative opiod consumption\n* complication rates\n* time to block completion",

      "description": "This study was conducted as a randomized controlled experiment to assess the impact of breast milk odor, applied before the first oral feeding of preterm infants transitioning to oral feeding, on their feeding performance. Infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who were beginning oral feeding were randomly assigned to one of two groups through computer randomization. In the \"pacifier\" group, infants were given a pacifier for 3 minutes one hour before feeding and again for 2 minutes 10 minutes before feeding to support oral feeding. In contrast, the \"breast milk odor and pacifier\" group received 2 cc of breast milk, which was dripped onto a sterile sponge and placed about 3 cm from the infant's nose one hour before feeding. At feeding time, all infants in both groups were bottle-fed by the researcher. This marked their first experience with oral feeding. The infants' feeding skills and performance were then evaluated using the Early Feeding Skills (EFS) form during the feeding session.",
      "detailedDescription": "Detailed Description:\n\nRecent research has indicated that olfactory stimulation can serve as an effective nonpharmacological method for enhancing feeding outcomes. Using breast milk for olfactory stimulation is both a cost-efficient and noninvasive approach that may speed up the process of oral feeding and lead to better feeding results. This study aimed to assess the impact of breast milk odor, applied before the first oral feeding of preterm infants transitioning to oral feeding, on their feeding performance. The sample size was calculated using power analysis, based on data from similar studies. As per the analysis, the study intended to include a total of 50 preterm infants, with at least 25 infants in each group. Following verbal and written consent from the families of eligible infants, the study proceeded with those mothers and infants who agreed to participate.\n\nBefore Feeding A pulse oximeter was attached to the feet of all infants to monitor their heart rate and oxygen saturation levels. The researcher filled out the \"Preterm Infant Identification Form.\" Nurses caring for the infants included in the study were briefed, and care was provided for 60 minutes before feeding and 10 minutes after feeding to ensure the babies could rest. No painful or stressful procedures were conducted during this period. All interventions were carried out by the researcher in a quiet and calm environment within the incubator to minimize the impact of external factors. Sixty minutes before feeding, all infants were positioned in a semi-elevated side-lying position.\n\nPacifier Group: To support oral feeding, a pacifier was provided for 3 minutes one hour before feeding time and again for 2 minutes 10 minutes before feeding. Heart rate and oxygen saturation levels were recorded 10 minutes before feeding.\n\nBreast Milk Scent and Pacifier Group: Similar to the pacifier group, infants in this group received a pacifier for 3 minutes one hour before feeding and for 2 minutes 10 minutes before feeding. Additionally, 2 cc of breast milk was dripped onto a sterile sponge and placed inside the incubator, approximately 3 cm from the infant's nose. Heart rate and oxygen saturation levels were also recorded 10 minutes before feeding.\n\nDuring Feeding:\n\nOnce all pre-feeding procedures were completed and documented, the infant's position remained unchanged by the researcher. The bottle was introduced near the infant's mouth while they were in a semi-raised, side-lying position. The stopwatch was activated as soon as the infant began sucking. To avoid tiring the infant, feeding was limited to 30 minutes. Throughout this period, heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation (SpO2) were continuously monitored. The infant's feeding skills were assessed using the Early Feeding Skills (EFS) form by an observer nurse who was not involved in the study.\n\nA slow-flow, soft nipple bottle with a smaller hole was used for feeding. To encourage feeding, the researcher gently touched the infant's lips with the bottle nipple. Once the infant's mouth opened, the nipple was placed inside, carefully lowering the tongue. During feeding, any stimulating actions, such as moving or rotating the bottle in the mouth, were avoided.\n\nThe infants were closely monitored for signs of fatigue (e.g., reduced sucking, milk leakage, difficulty maintaining posture) and symptoms of physiological or behavioral stress (e.g., pulling the head back, trying to turn away, coughing, grimacing, aspiration, desaturation, apnea, bradycardia, tachycardia). If any stress or fatigue signs were observed, feeding was paused to allow the infant to rest. Feeding resumed once the infant was physiologically stable (HR 120-160/min, SpO2 \u226590) and behaviorally ready.\n\nAfter Feeding:\n\nTo avoid influencing physiological measurements, no interventions were made for 10 minutes post-feeding. The infant's HR, SpO2 values, feeding duration, and the amount of milk consumed during feeding were recorded on the data form.",
      "eligibilityCriteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\nparents must give voluntary consent to participate; the infant must have been born between 26 and 34 weeks of gestation, as determined by the mother's last menstrual period; at the time of the study, the infant must be more than 30 weeks postmenstrual; the infant must be transitioning from enteral to oral feeding for the first time; the infant must be free of health issues other than prematurity; the infant must be fed with the mother's milk; the physician must have approved the infant's readiness for oral feeding; the infant must exhibit physiological and behavioral signs that indicate readiness for oral feeding.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nsevere bronchopulmonary dysplasia; any gastrointestinal, neurological, or genetic disorder (such as necrotizing enterocolitis, intracranial hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, omphalocele, Down syndrome, gastroschisis); any condition that could interfere with oral feeding (such as cleft palate, cleft lip, facial muscle paralysis, craniofacial anomaly)."

      "detailedDescription": "Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy account for approximately 14% of maternal mortality globally and is the fourth leading cause of maternal mortality in Malaysia. Despite this, the mechanisms and pathogenesis are still unknown. Vitamin D deficiency (hypovitaminosis vitamin D) has been shown to be one of the causes of gestational hypertension(GH).\n\nSeveral populations have observed the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of vitamin D receptor (VDR) to vitamin D deficiency among pregnancy complications, including GH. Alarming cases of hypovitaminosis D in sunny areas including Malaysia, highly imply the need to understand the genetic factor. Hence, genotyping VDR variants among pregnant women is essential for early vitamin D supplementation strategy. To investigators knowledge, there has been no published study conducted among Malaysian population on the association of VDR genetic variation and GH. Therefore, this study aim to investigate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and its association of VDR SNPs to the development of GH among Malaysian pregnant mothers, with the main focus on Malays, representing the largest ethnic in Malaysia.\n\nThe prevalence will be determined through a cross-sectional study involving 363 pregnant women recruited in Hospital Pengajar UPM (HPUPM) and Hospital Serdang, Selangor. Relevant socio-demographic, clinical and anthropometric data will be collected using structured interviewer-administered questionnaire. Blood specimens for the analysis of vitamin D will be done. The association will be determined in a case-control study involving 180 pregnant women who fulfilled the criteria, recruited from phase 1 study. Their blood will be further analysed for the variants of the VDR gene \\[(BsmI(rs1544410), FokI(rs2228570), TaqI(rs731236)\\] to look for the association.\n\nThis study expected to provide more evidence for early personalised intervention of vitamin D supplementation due to anticipated individual genetic variability. This antenatal care programme will reduce the government expenditures, reduce maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality while strengthening Malaysia's healthcare system.",

The safety and efficacy outcome measures will be assessed at baseline and 12 weeks.",
      "detailedDescription": "Migraine is \"a common episodic neurological disorder with complex pathophysiology that manifests as recurrent attacks of typically throbbing and unilateral, often severe headache with certain associated features such as nausea, phonophobia, and photophobia\". Worldwide, estimated prevalence was 13.8% to 15%. Quality of life of a migraine patient is extremely low and migraine badly hampers one's physical, emotional, and social efficiency and disrupt familial, social and professional relationships. Diagnosis is solely clinical depending on characteristics of headache and associated symptoms. Neuroimaging can be done only when exclusion of another cause of headache is needed.\n\nExact etiology and pathophysiology of migraine is unknown and multifactorial. There are several hypotheses of migraine pain generation. Local dilatation of intracranial and extracerebral vessels activate trigeminal nerve surrounding cerebral and meningeal vasculature. Migraine pain starts from the activation of trigeminovascular system. Afferent fibers innervating cerebral and meningeal vessels project to central nervous system and releases vasoactive peptides and inflammatory mediators. Some important mediators like Calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), NO, Substance P play role in inflammation and vasodilatation. Then sensitization and discharge of thalamic neuron and subsequent projection to sensory cortical neurons occurs. Thus, pain perception is received in migraine.\n\nIn studies, elevated levels of C reactive protein (CRP) and Transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) provides evidence of neuroinflammation. In migraine, impairment of cerebral mitochondrial energy metabolism and oxidative stress occurs. As a result, abnormalities in cerebral vasculature results in Cortical Spreading Depression (CSD).\n\nNiacin, which is known as nicotinic acid or Vitamin B3 is the precursor of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD) or Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADP). From dietary tryptophan, through kynurenine pathway, NAD is produced, and rest 1% tryptophan is catabolized to form serotonin (5- hydroxytryptamine/ 5-HT). Migraine is a serotonin deficient condition. It has been estimated that, dietary intake of Niacin is low in migraine patients.\n\nNiacin supplementation provides enough NAD to inhibit Kynurenine pathway and accelerate production of 5-HT from tryptophan. Serotonin acting on 5-HT1 receptor, causes vasoconstriction. It may activate nerve endings in cerebral microcirculation and sensitize them to vasodilatory kinins. Serotonin also inhibits synthesis, release of NO, glutamate, Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). As a result, inhibition of afferent pain transmission and prevention of neuroinflammation occurs. Niacin also reduces inflammation evidenced by decrease level of pro inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, TNF \u03b1, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). Increasing level of Niacin also improves brain energy deficiency, and has potent antioxidant properties, which may be helpful in migraine prevention. However, more prospective investigations are necessary to validate niacin's preventive effect on migraine.",

      "description": "Investigators will address the overarching challenge of advancing health equity and reducing disparities in prostate cancer by informing efforts to reduce travel burden in prostate cancer (PCa) treatment access among Black men.",
      "detailedDescription": "The following are the three aims of the proposal:\n\nAim 1: Determine how travel distance for PCa treatment impacts the outcome\n\nAim 2: Pilot a trial by offering ridesharing services for Black men seeking definitive PCa treatment in Greater Boston to reduce missed appointments. The investigators will implement a pre/post evaluation design with matched historical controls to estimate the impact of rideshares on reducing missed appointments among Black men seeking care at the Mass General Brigham Prostate Cancer Outreach Clinic. The investigators will also calculate the reduction in time from diagnosis to receipt of treatment associated with the intervention.\n\nWhat is the Prostate Cancer Outreach Clinic?\n\nIn 2018, MGB launched the United Against Racism initiative, a long-term, multi-million-dollar commitment to address the many impacts that racism has on MGB patients, employees, and the broader community. One of these projects, the Mass General Brigham Prostate Cancer Outreach Clinic (PCOC), founded by Dr. Quoc-Dien Trinh (PI), as a response to widening inequities in PCa care in Massachusetts. The PCOC serves as a catalyst to increase access for marginalized communities through high-quality, accessible, and affordable PCa care in MGB's flagship hospitals including Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital.\n\nWho are the target population?\n\nThe PCOC prospectively collects granular patient demographics and outcome metrics such as missed appointments and time to treatment initiation, among others, making it an ideal resource for a pre/post rideshare pilot trial. All data collected by the PCOC is found on MGB's REDCAP. The target population is Black men with intermediate or high-risk PCa, as Black men are more likely to report travel burden when accessing care and, therefore, most likely to benefit from ridesharing services.\n\nWhat is the study design?\n\nThe investigators will implement a pre/post-evaluation design with matched historical controls to estimate the impact of rideshares on reducing missed appointments.\n\nHistorical controls will be sampled from the pre-intervention period of April 2022 to September 2024 and the post-intervention period between October 2024 and November 2025, where October 2024 represents the initiation of the intervention.\n\nParticipants who identify as Black and reside in a census tract in Massachusetts and are recognized as having a high travel burden based on results from Aim 1 will be eligible to receive the rideshare intervention. By restricting the intervention to Black men, the investigators will ensure that men who are more likely to benefit from ridesharing services are recruited. Controls will be matched based on age, comorbidities, treatment received, and geographic characteristics identified in Aim 1. The investigators will prospectively collect patient information that will be used to match the pre-and post-intervention cohorts. The PCOC has the staff, resources, and patient load needed to conduct the pilot trial.\n\nThe number of rides offered will depend on the type of definitive treatment that participants will receive (standard of care), but the investigators will offer as many rides as needed for treatment completion. Historically, 45% of patients undergo surgery, 45% receive external beam radiation, and 10% receive brachytherapy. On average, men who undergo surgery have 3 to 4 visits: preoperative evaluation, consultation for comorbidities, surgery, and postoperative follow-up. Men who receive external beam radiation will have, on average, 20 to 28 sessions, along with pre-and post-radiation evaluation (average of 30 visits), while men who have brachytherapy will have on average, 5 to 6 visits. In addition to these rideshares, the investigators have appropriately budgeted for some additional or emergency room visits, and thus, do not anticipate issues covering or reimbursing any additional clinic or emergency room visits.\n\nWhat is the endpoint?\n\nThe primary endpoint is the rate of missed appointments, defined as any scheduled appointment where a patient canceled or did not show up during the pre-and post-intervention periods. The investigators will examine the time from diagnosis to treatment initiation in days as a secondary endpoint.\n\nWhat is the intervention?\n\nAt the time of referral, the PCOC community healthcare worker will collect patient demographics and information that will be used for the analysis and will be stored on MGB's REDCAP or Dropbox. The figure below describes the pilot trial's workflow.\n\nBefore the visit, the community healthcare worker will schedule the ride and contact the patient via text or call with the trip details. Liaison escorts will be available to receive the patient upon arrival and accompany the patient to the clinic. Upon completion of the visit, the healthcare worker would schedule a ride back to the original destination. A dedicated healthcare worker will manage all ride dispatches and will be responsible for notifying the patient of trip details (scheduled time of the ride, reminders, expected time of arrival at trip destination, name of the driver, and any delays or driver cancelations). The investigators will partner with one rideshare vendor to facilitate ride dispatches and simplify the billing system. Vendors like Uber Health or Lyft Healthcare have dashboards that allow the scheduling, coordination, and tracking of rides in a HIPAA-secure environment.\n\nWhich analysis will the investigators be conducting?\n\nSixty patients (n=60) who received the intervention (post-intervention cohort) will be matched 1:1 to pre-intervention patients (n=60), based on age, comorbidities, treatment, insurance coverage type, and geographic characteristics using coarsened exact matching. The investigators expect that a patient will have 12 visits on average. The outcome will be the percentage of missed visits over the study period. The distribution of the percentage visits is binomial, with extra variation due to the possible correlation of repeated visits on the same patient. The comparison of the outcome across matched post-vs pre-intervention patients will be performed with binomial logistic regression, with the intervention period as the independent variable, with an over dispersion parameter to account for the extra variation in the outcome due to the repeated visits on a patient. The investigators will adjust the standard error to account for the matching using generalized estimated equations. The investigators will also evaluate the time from diagnosis to treatment initiation using Cox regression models.\n\nIs the pilot study powered?\n\nWith 60 patients in the post-intervention group (rideshare) matched to 60 patients in the pre-intervention group (usual care) and an average of 12 visits per patient, the investigators have over 80% power (alpha=5%) to detect a decrease in missed visits from 20% in the pre-intervention group to 10% in the post-intervention group using the binomial logistic regression model. This effect size is consistent with the impacts of rideshare interventions documented in the literature. In this power calculation, the investigators conservatively assume the over-dispersion parameter (inflation in variance due to repeated visits) is \"strong\" = 2.5, as well as a correlation of 0.1 between the matched pairs. Because, in the last quarter, the investigators recruited more than 30 Black men, by September 2024, the investigators expect to have more than 250 controls for whom the investigators could match, and more than 120 patients have the potential to be recruited between October 2024 and November 2025. Therefore, the investigators have enough patients to conduct the pre/post-evaluation.\n\nAre patients remunerated for participation?\n\nRecruited patients will not receive compensation for participating in the trial, participants will receive the ridesharing services as the intervention of the pilot trial.\n\nAim 3: Conduct multilevel semi-structured interviews to identify barriers to and facilitators of ridesharing services through the PCOC.\n\nIn Aim 3.1, the investigators will engage the recipients (Men recruited in Aim 2) and the initiators of the intervention to identify the successes and challenges of the intervention through questions the investigators will develop with the team and stakeholder board.\n\nIn Aim 3.2, the investigators will collaborate with the stakeholder board to interpret and contextualize the quantitative and qualitative findings by holding a town hall meeting. The investigators will then employ a Delphi process to reach a consensus regarding the epidemiologic and geographic targets among Black men with PCa associated with travel burden and warrant intervention. The findings and recommendations will be published in a white paper to inform future ridesharing programs and policy changes to reduce travel burden to PCa treatment centers.\n\nWho will be conducting the interviews?\n\nOnly research staff on this protocol will conduct interviews. The stakeholder board will help develop the questionnaire but will not participate in the interview process.\n\nWho are the informants the investigators will be recruiting?\n\nThe investigators will recruit 15 participants who are initiators of the intervention group and 15 participants who are the recipients of ridesharing services.\n\nThe initiators will include clinicians, nurses, patient navigators, community healthcare workers, social workers, and health equity officers at MGB who either work at the PCOC or occupy managerial and executive roles within the institution, as well as urban planners and ridesharing vendors (Uber and/or Lyft). The recipients will include participants who received ridesharing services for PCa treatment (Aim 2) as well as members of community-based organizations. The investigators have included community-based organizations in the recipient group to represent the voices of potential patients who might benefit from ridesharing services. This number of interviews will allow for sufficient thematic saturation among both groups, while also being logistically feasible. The investigators have budgeted for 15 additional interviews, should a total of 30 interviews be insufficient to reach thematic saturation.\n\nWhat is the recruitment process?\n\nPurposive sampling will be employed to identify and invite key informants. The investigators have strong ties within MGB, and the investigators have commitments from the multidisciplinary stakeholder board to help with the recruitment process. Based on experience, the investigators expect 80% of the invited informants to participate.\n\nHow will the interviews be conducted?\n\nParticipants will be given the choice to be either interviewed in-person or remotely via telephone or Zoom (a web-based communication platform). Interview guide domains and questions will be developed by the investigators with relevant clinical and substantive expertise and informed by the stakeholder board and prior literature.\n\nWhat is the type of remuneration for participation in the interviews?\n\nInterviews will be scheduled for approximately 45 minutes, and participants will be remunerated a total of $50.\n\nWhat type of questions will be asked in the interview?\n\nBelow is an overview of the type of questions the investigators will ask the recipients and the initiators of the intervention. Although this is not a final list, the investigators anticipate that the questionnaire will be very similar. The final questionnaire will be appended to the protocol once it is developed and reviewed by the investigators of the study.\n\nHow will the interviews be analyzed?\n\nTranscribed digital recordings and notes from semi-structured interviews will be analyzed using standard qualitative methodologies described by the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research and others. Data analysis will be conducted separately for the initiators and recipients and then together to extract themes for each of the RE-AIM domains (figure above). A chronology of events will be examined in addition to key themes to assess the complexity of the intervention. Two members of the research team will independently code interview transcripts and develop a preliminary codebook. The investigators will use a combination of inductive and deductive coding based on the interview domains. The analysis will entail a multistep process, guided by Braun \\& Clarke. At least 2 members will independently review all transcripts and engage in a multistage coding process to further develop and generate the final codebook. Once consensus has been reached, reports will be generated for each code, and the team will refine the themes to ensure the data within each theme is both cohesive and distinct. In the final phase of analysis, illustrative quotes will be selected to produce a succinct, cogent story of the data within and across the identified themes from across sources of data. Qualitative study findings will be presented in a report summarizing themes extracted from initiator and recipient interviews and circulated to key participants for review and comment. The study team will then review the report to compare the themes raised by respondents regarding the effectiveness and implementation of ridesharing services and its ability in to reduce Black-White disparities in access to PCa treatment.\n\nWhat is the town hall forum the investigators will be holding to share the results?\n\nThe investigators will share the findings and themes in a town hall forum as a mechanism to (1) share findings with the key informants, stakeholder board, and community; (2) further contextualize findings; and (3) generate a comprehensive list of recommendations through charette-style planning and a Delphi process. The investigators will work with members of the stakeholder board to coordinate a culminating town hall meeting, at which key findings will be shared. The investigators will encourage broad engagement and inclusivity by inviting key community advocacy and patient support groups. During the town hall meeting, the investigators will use elements of charrette-style planning to engage group members in the process of making sense of the findings and generating recommendations. The investigators plan to hold the town hall meeting in person.\n\nWhat is the charette process for synthesizing recommendations?\n\nCharette is an intensive, hands-on workshop for a solution-oriented design and planning method. Charette participants will work in small task-oriented groups to explore findings gathered during the intervention and themes extracted from interviews to generate recommendations in a predefined timeframe. Each group will have a recorder who will keep track of the ideas. Once the time is up, the recorder will move to the next group and present the current state of the topic at hand. The purpose of the charette is to build on previous discussions and propose new ideas. Once the topics have rotated among all the groups, the results of each group session will be shared with the larger planning group for further discussion. At the culmination of the group discussion, participants will use dot-polling, which is an interactive process used during planning to prioritize items. Charette participants will synthesize draft recommendations that will be reviewed by experts and finalized through a Delphi process to develop stakeholder consensus to define population-level epidemiologic and community characteristics that identify who faces travel burden and where interventions are warranted to reduce travel burden for Black men with PCa.\n\nWhat is the Delphi process?\n\nThe Delphi process is a consensus method used to systematically collect expert opinions. It has been used widely in healthcare research to set priorities and develop practices when obtaining high-level scientific evidence is impractical. The technique provides a transparent and rigorous basis for assessing expert opinion and involves asking a panel to take part in a series of rounds to identify, clarify, and refine thinking around topics. The investigators will use a modified Delphi approach, which limits the number of rating rounds and relies to some extent on anonymity, feedback, and replication so that individuals can express opinions without being unduly influenced by others. Since the Delphi process is an iterative process with a 2-week turnaround for each step, it will be held separately from the town hall meeting and entirely over Zoom.\n\nThe investigators will select and invite the Delphi panel members based on guidance from the stakeholder board, with the goal of ensuring that patients', community-based organizations', clinicians', hospital administrators', transport planners', and national policymakers' perspectives are all represented. The investigators will recruit approximately 25 members for the Delphi process, making sure that relevant perspectives inform the discussion, and that all have a chance to contribute meaningfully. The investigators will select participants who are geographically, racially, ethnically, and professionally diverse. The investigators will include experts in transportation planning, public health, health disparities, community engagement, and patient advocacy.\n\nThe process will consist of the following steps. The draft recommendations, as developed through charette-style discussion will be developed into an integrated list of recommendations and used for the Delphi process. Following this, the investigators will hold 4 rounds: Round 1 - Participants will review the draft list of recommendations that will identify those at risk of travel burden and identify a threshold for travel burden that warrants an intervention, add any comments, and suggest others to add to the list (2-week turnaround); Round 2 - Participants will rate each item on the list (2 weeks). The traditional 9-point scale will be used, where 1 = not important and 9 = most important. Results will be tabulated and distributed to all participants, with votes indicated so that participants can see how each question was answered relative to other voters; Round 3 - A webinar conference will be held with care taken to achieve a power balance and include perspectives of the virtual participants. Round 4 - Approximately 4 weeks later, the investigators will hold a concluding conference call to give participants an opportunity to discuss the results of the webinar and to offer ideas for dissemination or additional research. The goal is to go beyond merely stating that ridesharing services should be offered to high-risk and underserved populations, but rather, to seek explicit strategic advice for the feasibility and implementation of ridesharing services. Although the investigators cannot say ahead of time what those recommendations will be, the investigators would expect these to include strategies to align rideshare services with existing clinical structures and systems for reimbursement of services as well as an infrastructure to include a partnership and communication between rideshare options and clinical staff.",

      "description": "Congenital heart diseases, the most common type of congenital anomalies, which affect approximately 3% of all live births and are the second most common cause of death in infants, are associated with 7% of all neonatal deaths. Among the interventions that can be applied with family-centered care of newborns followed in the intensive care unit, infant massage and safe wrapping are suggested interventions for mother-infant bonding and parental self-efficacy through the infant's sense of touch.\n\nObjective: The aim of this study was to increase mother-infant attachment, increase the self-efficacy of the mother by taking an active role in baby care, reduce the baby's pain and stabilize vital signs, and increase the adaptation of the baby and the mother to the process and reduce the hospitalization day.\n\nIn this study, it was aimed to evaluate the effects of maternal massage and safe swaddling on attachment, self-efficacy, and vital signs of the infant in infants undergoing cardiovascular surgery (CVC).\n\nThe sample of the study, which was conducted in an experimental design with a pre-test-post-test control group, consisted of 36 infants and their mothers who had CVC between December 2020 and January 2022 and were hospitalized in the intensive care unit. Infant massage (n:12), safe swaddling (n:12) and control group (n:12) mothers were determined by computerized randomization. After the mother-infant pre-assessment questionnaire, Parental Self-Efficacy Scale (PSES) Scale, and Maternal Attachment Inventory (MAI) pre-tests were applied to the mothers, infant massage and safe swaddling instruction were given to the mothers. The hemodynamic findings of the infant were recorded before, during and after the practices. Post-tests were applied before hospital discharge.",
      "detailedDescription": "Of the 130 million children born in the world each year, four million die in the neonatal stage. Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a serious congenital anomaly that can be seen at a rate of 5-8 per 1000 live births and is associated with 7% of all neonatal deaths (Aykan et al., 2022; Ert\u00fcrk, 2016). Although pediatric cardiology and pediatric cardiovascular surgery have advanced, current data show that 21% of infants with congenital heart disease still die in the first month and 40% die due to congenital malformations (Beider et al., 2010). Early diagnosis of CHD, which is difficult to diagnose due to hemodynamic difference, and planning the treatment are important in terms of reducing morbidity and mortality in children (Bulut et al., 2012). While most of the babies with severe heart disease die in the first weeks of their lives, 25% of them need surgical intervention in the first week of their life (\u00d6zkan et al., 2010).\n\nPreterm and term newborns, who have to spend the first week of their lives in neonatal intensive care units, are exposed to many invasive procedures (2-3 or 8-10 times a day) and experience pain and stress for different reasons. The pain experienced by the baby can prevent his behavior, family-baby interaction, and the baby's adaptation to the outside world, as well as cause changes in the development of the brain and senses, and growth is negatively affected (Derebent, 2006). By maintaining the balance between medical interventions and good primary care, babies' stress, pain and anxiety symptoms should be reduced. Easy-to-apply, low-cost non-pharmacological methods can be effective alone in pain caused by small invasive interventions; It has been reported that when used together with pharmacological methods, they increase the effectiveness of drugs (\u015eaduman, 2011).\n\nThe mother, whose baby is in the intensive care unit, has difficulties in establishing a close relationship with her child, and the mother's anxiety makes the attachment process more difficult. Effective nursing interventions to meet the needs of parents; helping parents to understand the infant's reactions, expressing their fears and expectations, actively listening to them, answering questions honestly, informing the parent about the treatment plan and program. It is also a nurse's responsibility to ensure mother-child interaction by enabling the mother to participate more in the care of the child (\u00d6zyaz\u0131c\u0131o\u011flu, 2009). Increasing maternal experiences is important in mother-infant interaction. The most important component of these interventions is that intensive care nurses help the mother to be a good observer in evaluating her behavior in order to increase the mother's self-confidence in taking care of the baby and to strengthen her better relationship with her baby. The goal is primarily to ensure that the mother perceives her baby positively. Then, it is to give the mother the opportunity to touch, hold, care and observe her baby and to support her to give sensitive and positive reactions to her reactions to environmental stimuli. Thus, the mother's self-confidence, her ability to read the baby's reactions and her ability to meet the baby's needs are increased (Aras et al., 2013). The most commonly used non-pharmacological techniques in the care of these babies are various techniques and therapies such as reducing environmental stimuli, individualized developmental care and evaluation program of the newborn, music therapy, breastfeeding, supporting non-nutritive sucking, giving sweet solution, skin-to-skin contact, changing position, hugging, kangaroo care, massage therapy and wrapping. These techniques and therapies have an improving effect on cardiovascular and skeletal muscle functions (Beider et al., 2010; Y\u0131ld\u0131z, 2017).\n\nThe sense of touch is very important in the child's perception of his environment, especially in the newborn and infancy period. The baby communicates and recognizes his environment through the sense of touch. Appropriate stimulation of the sense of touch supports psychosocial development. Baby massage is a simple, inexpensive and effective technique that is beneficial for baby development. Baby massage is a new practice in our country, which many families are interested in, both for this reason and because it allows parents to freely apply it to their babies. Touch is proof of love. The creation of mother-father-infant interaction and the development of healthy attachment affect the development of the baby and his whole life. The family's loving attachment to the baby is the most important factor that accelerates its healthy growth and development. Massage; It is the mechanical and nervous stimulation of the skin, subcutaneous adipose tissue, muscles, internal organs, metabolism, circulation and lymph system for therapeutic and/or protective purposes. Many positive effects such as providing relaxation, reducing painful muscle tensions, relieving sleep problems and pain, improving self-esteem in individuals with physical disorders and terminal illness, and managing mental health problems can be achieved with massage application (G\u00fcrol, 2010). In addition, baby massage is between mother and baby.",

      "detailedDescription": "Implications of Post-Stroke Dysphagia Dysphagia (swallowing impairment) after stroke is common, estimated to affect 78% of patients.1 Dysphagia results in additional negative consequences that complicate patient recovery and increase the risk of developing pulmonary complications (aspiration pneumonia) and may result in suboptimal nutrition. These comorbidities increase cost of care, up to $6,243 on average per patient, placing a burden not only on the individual, but also the healthcare system at large. The effects of dysphagia post-stroke extend beyond physical health concerns and increase the risk of depression, with devastating impacts on quality of life. Given these undesirable and dangerous health consequences, adequate assessment and treatment of swallowing impairments after stroke is a critical component of rehabilitation for this patient population.\n\nLimitations to Current Treatment Approaches Current treatment approaches to alleviate dysphagia after stroke, especially in acute and sub-acute phases, have primarily focused on diet modification, compensatory posturing, and providing alternate access to hydration and nutrition. While the goal of these strategies is to improve swallow safety and avoid negative consequences of airway invasion, these techniques can be burdensome to the patient if implemented long-term. Additionally, these approaches do not target rehabilitation of swallowing function, but rather provide a somewhat temporary solution to what is, for many patients, a life-long issue. Available rehabilitative approaches to target improvements in function of oropharyngeal musculature during swallowing include both swallowing exercises (task-specific) and non-swallowing exercises (e.g. tongue exercise), which rely on the principles of transference to improve swallowing function. However, evidence is inconsistent regarding efficacy of these \"exercise-based\" interventions that target the oropharyngeal musculature, and the scientific validity of these trials varies greatly. Of these non-swallowing exercise approaches, lingual (tongue) exercise has been frequently studied and can be facilitated by medical devices which provide bio-feedback of lingual pressure generative capabilities to the patient and clinician. However, there is little to no evidence that lingual strengthening improves swallow physiology or functional outcomes in post-stroke dysphagia, and a majority of these previous studies lack use of standardized outcomes or randomized controlled trial procedures. Also, lingual strengthening may not induce biological changes to tongue muscle fiber size, as would be expected with a resistance-based exercise program. Despite these mixed findings, lingual strengthening is still routinely to treat post-stroke dysphagia. A major limitation of these current approaches is a sole focus on increasing muscular strength alone without consideration for other aspects of muscle physiology necessary for swallowing, such as endurance.\n\nLingual Endurance Training as an Alternative Approach In this preliminary study, we have proposed to examine the effects of lingual endurance training in individuals with dysphagia after stroke, as an alternative approach to traditional progressive lingual strength training, because this patient group is known to have specific deficits in lingual function after stroke. Both oral and pharyngeal tongue movements are essential for safe and efficient swallowing. Thus, exercise of the lingual musculature is a reasonable goal. However, swallowing is an endurance task; lingual pressures required for swallowing are submaximal, requiring repeated and sustained contraction over the course of a meal. Thus, targeting improvement in lingual endurance over strength alone may provide greater transferrable benefit to daily swallowing tasks. However, there are currently no randomized controlled trials investigating efficacy of lingual endurance training as a treatment for dysphagia in any patient population. As such, this proposed preliminary trial is essential to gathering the necessary pilot evidence regarding whether lingual endurance training is feasible and effective as an alternative approach to dysphagia rehabilitation for individuals with swallowing impairments after stroke. The long-term goal of this proposed work is to develop improved, evidence-based protocols for lingual exercise training for individuals with dysphagia after stroke. Ultimately, the results of this proposed pilot will be highly significant in creating movement towards more specific and evidence-based approaches for this unique patient group, who currently have very few rehabilitative options available. In this initial trial, we will assess if lingual endurance training will be feasible (Aim 1) and effective (Aim 2) for improving swallowing function in post-stroke dysphagia.",

      "description": "Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people with atrial fibrillation (AF) and prevent stroke or systemic embolism (blood clots travelling through the blood stream to plug another vessel).\n\nAtrial fibrillation is a condition of having irregular and often rapid heartbeat. It can lead to the formation of blood clots in the heart which can travel through the blood stream to plug another vessel, and like this lead to serious and life-threatening conditions, such as a stroke. A stroke occurs because the brain tissue beyond the blockage no longer receives nutrients and oxygen so that brain cells die. As strokes arising from atrial fibrillation can involve extensive areas of the brain, it is important to prevent them.\n\nBlood clots are formed in a process known as coagulation. Medications are already available to prevent the formation of blood clots. When taken by mouth (orally), they are known as oral anticoagulants (OACs) including apixaban. OACs decrease the risk of the above-mentioned serious and life-threatening conditions. The main side effect of OACs is an increase of the risk of bleeding.\n\nThe study treatment asundexian is a new type of anticoagulant currently under development to provide further treatment options. Asundexian aims to further improve the standard of care with regard to the risk of bleeding.\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to collect more data about how well asundexian works to prevent stroke and systemic embolism and how safe it is compared to apixaban in people with atrial fibrillation and at high risk for stroke.\n\nTo see how well the study treatment asundexian works researchers compare:\n\n* how long asundexian works well and\n* how long apixaban works well after the start of the treatment. Working well means that the treatments can prevent the following from happening:\n* stroke and/or\n* systemic embolism. The study will keep collecting data until a certain number of strokes or embolisms happen in the study.\n\nTo see how safe asundexian is, the researchers will compare how often major bleedings occur after taking the study treatments asundexian and apixaban, respectively. Major bleedings are bleedings that have a serious or even life-threatening impact on a person's health.\n\nThe study participants will be randomly (by chance) assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups, A and B. Dependent on the treatment group, the participants will either take the study treatment asundexian by mouth once a day or apixaban by mouth twice a day for approximately 9 - 33 months.\n\nEach participant will be in the study for approximately 9 - 34 months. There will be visits to the study site every 3 to 6 months and up to 7 phone calls. Those participants who do not want or are unable to have visits to the study site may join the study remotely in selected locations.

Traditionally, the procedure is performed awake and under local anaesthesia to facilitate intraoperative monitoring via microelectrode recording and test stimulation for exact electrode positioning. Advances in MR imaging allow for clear visualization of the STN and therefore direct targeting. Retrospective series suggest that MRI-guided and image (CT or MRI)-verified STN-DBS under general anaesthesia yields a similar motor outcome and quality of life (QoL) as awake and microelectrode recording-guided surgery with intra-operative clinical testing.

      "description": "Hearing loss is a major public health concern due to its negative association with emotional well-being, cognition, and physical ailments, such as diabetes. Access to audiologists and otolaryngologists in many regions across the US is poor or extremely limited. Rural populations are older, less educated, and have lower household incomes compared to populations in metropolitan areas. Also, with increasing age adults experience greater rates of hearing loss. Fortunately, the 2022 FDA Final Rule for Over-the-Counter Hearing Aids (OTC HAs) could revolutionize assess to hearing aids and hearing healthcare by allowing adults with perceived mild-to-moderate hearing loss to purchase these devices over the counter, without medical clearance or care from an audiologist. Pharmacies located in rural areas now have the option to provide OTC HAs, something previously not possible. Currently, however, there are no established guidelines for effective provision of these devices in pharmacies located in rural communities. Educating pharmacy technicians to provide basic hearing healthcare related to OTC HAs use could address a critical need and create a new care delivery model to ensure sustainable, long-term access to hearing healthcare. The long-term goal of this study is to create a sustainable interprofessional collaborative between audiologists and pharmacists for the development of a hearing healthcare model that improves access and affordability of care in rural regions across the country. The specific aims are to 1) Determine an effective approach for educating pharmacy technicians for the provision of OTC HAs in rural community pharmacies, and 2) Identify satisfaction of care provided by pharmacy technicians and initial performance with OTC HAs in adults with hearing loss living in rural communities. A stepped wedged clinical trial design will be used to study the effectiveness of a comprehensive educational training program for pharmacy technicians. Technicians from rural Alabama and Mississippi, placed within four different clusters, will participate in a multimodal training program for the purpose of developing basic clinical skills to assist adults with perceived mild-to-moderate hearing loss. Additionally, adults with hearing loss who receive clinical services from trained pharmacy technicians will be asked to report on the care they received and benefit from their OTC HAs. The central hypotheses are a) that pharmacy technician training will result in greater understanding of hearing healthcare concepts compared to no training, and b) the training will lead to successful provision of basic hearing healthcare to adults with hearing loss in rural communities. The expected outcome of this project will be the establishment of a multimodal education program, leveraging the increased access of OTC HAs, to support those with hearing loss in rural pharmacies across the county. The ability of pharmacy technicians to provide this support will dramatically increase the availability of hearing services in rural communities, which will positively impact the quality of life for those with hearing loss.",
      "detailedDescription": "Many adults with hearing loss have no access to hearing healthcare due to a variety of factors1. One primary factor is that approximately 56% of counties across the US have no available audiological services. These counties are characterized by lower household incomes and older populations. Within some of these rural communities in Alabama, Hay-McCutcheon and colleagues found that adults with hearing loss did not know where to obtain services, travel distance to an audiologist was excessive, finances or insurance was lacking, some denied having hearing loss, and many did not know how to begin to address a hearing loss. Not addressing a hearing loss has significant implications for emotional well-being and mental health. Studies have found that hearing loss is associated with increased social isolation and loneliness. These conditions, in turn, can lead to cognitive decline. In addition to mental health, hearing loss has been associated with diabetes, affecting physical well-being. Considering the impact that hearing loss can have on general well-being, it is imperative that new models of care are developed to address this public health concern, especially for those living in rural and underserved communities, where access to hearing healthcare is limited. Addressing access to hearing healthcare for rural and underserved communities is a primary goal outlined in the 2016 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine document, Hearing Health Care for Adults: Priorities for Improving Access and Affordability10 and within the Notice of Special Interest for this application, Hearing Healthcare for Adults: Improving Access and Affordability (NOT-DC-21-001).\n\nIn an attempt to address the lack of hearing healthcare for adults, the FDA issued a Final Rule for OTC HAs in 2022. This rule allows adults who are 18 years of age or older with perceived mild-to-moderate hearing loss to purchase OTC aids without a medical exam, from an unlicensed seller, and without a prescription or fitting from an audiologist. Consequently, many adults without access to hearing healthcare now have the option to address their own hearing loss. Currently, these hearing aids can be purchased from retail stores, pharmacies, or online, and can range from approximately $200 per pair to up to $3000 per pair. However, for those who do not have geographical access to retail outlets, the internet, or who are not technologically astute, these potential solutions to hearing loss will remain elusive. Large retail chains are not easily accessible in rural communities, nor is access to the internet. To mitigate this problem, new care delivery models are needed to assist those with hearing loss across racial, educational, and economic lines. The study outlined in this proposal, where pharmacy technicians will be trained to assist rural populations with the provision of OTC HAs, is significant because it will be the first step for the development of a new care delivery model to increase access of hearing healthcare. Within the audiology field, it is not uncommon for support staff to be trained to assist with hearing assessments, such as newborn hearing screenings, elder care in hospitals, and hearing screenings for elementary school children. Educating technicians to assist pharmacists with the provision of OTC HAs, therefore, is a logical step to address hearing healthcare.\n\nIn rural communities, the pharmacy provides support to residents in a variety of ways. Pharmacists are trusted professionals who are trained to care for their patients and their medication-related needs. Community pharmacies have been referred to as untapped resources for public health. The pharmacy profession supports expanding roles for pharmacy technicians. Literature has suggested that their roles should be expanded to provide more point-of-care treatment, such as cholesterol and blood glucose screening, increasing duties associated with the technical aspects of pharmacy operations, and pharmacy administration duties. The development of a new care delivery model where the professions of audiology and pharmacy can work together to increase access to hearing healthcare in rural communities is highly significant.\n\nResults from rigorous clinical trials conducted by Humes and colleagues in a largely white, highly educated, metropolitan college community demonstrated that adults with hearing loss can effectively set consumer driven (CD), or OTC, hearing aids independently. But data from these studies also suggested that adults were more satisfied with the hearing aids if they were given help setting the device. Over the past two years we have been conducting a clinical trial with OTC HAs (ID: NCT04671381) in West Central and South Alabama and unpublished preliminary data from 29 participants on a measure of hearing handicap found a large Cohen's d effect size of 0.91 when comparing adults who received no guidance setting their OTC HAs to those who received guidance after four weeks of OTC HA use. These data further stress the importance of developing care delivery models for rural communities to assist with the provision of OTC HAs.\n\nInformation from this study will provide the basis for interprofessional collaboration among audiologists, pharmacists, and pharmacy technicians for the provision of basic hearing healthcare in rural communities with older and poor populations. Also, the study will identify best practices for educating pharmacy technicians in the provision of OTC HAs in rural and communities. Importantly, these contributions will address an area of need outlined in the Hearing Healthcare for Adults: Improving Access and Affordability (NOT-DC-21-001), which is to increase access to hearing healthcare in diverse populations using innovative care delivery models.",

It has been shown that improper glycemia control leads to impaired wound healing and a higher risk of other postoperative complications. However, glucose levels measured in patients before surgery are taken infrequently, and there remains controversy regarding optimal management. Usually, a blood glucose meter is used to measure non-fasted blood glucose concentrations, and a single-point measurement can easily misrepresent the actual glycemic control. Continuous glucose monitoring allows for a minimally invasive real-time remote glycemia control and is providing insights into glucose regulation in patients, demonstrating significant periods of clinically silent hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.\n\nThe primary aim of our project is to assess the feasibility of the use of CGM in measuring blood glucose levels in patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery.

Lower extremity peripheral blocks can be used preoperatively to minimize the use of sedatives that may be required during positioning and to provide effective and safe analgesia.",
      "detailedDescription": "In the study, one anesthesiologist (Anesthesiologist A) will perform the relevant peripheral blocks according to the groups to which the patients are randomized; the other anesthesiologist (Anesthesiologist B) will perform unilateral spinal anesthesia in all patients blinded to the peripheral blocks.\n\nOn the day of surgery, the patients will first be taken to the block application room and standard monitoring (ECG, pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure) will be applied in the supine position. In the pre-block period, individual pain assessment will be performed with the Visual Analog Scale (VAS - 0 cm = no pain / 10 cm = unbearable pain) and recorded on the case report form. After the pain assessment, disinfection of the block area will be performed with 10% povidone iodine (Batidex) in accordance with surgical sterilization rules. After sterilization, the relevant peripheral block will be performed by Anesthesiologist A under USG guidance. Intermittent negative aspiration will be performed during all interventions to detect possible vascular puncture. All groups will receive 30 ml of local anesthetic solution containing 5 mcg/ml adrenaline and bupivacaine at 0.25% concentration.\n\nGroup 1 (PENG Block): Convex USG Probe (1-5 mHz) is placed transversely on SIAS (Spina Iliaca Anterior Superior). The probe is then rotated 45 degrees and aligned with the pubic ramus. In this position, the iliopubic eminence, ilipsoas muscle-tendon, femoral artery and pectineus muscle are observed. A 100 mm 21G block needle (Stimuplex A\u00ae:B. Braun Melsungen AG, Japan) is inserted in-plane from lateral to medial to the musculofascial plane with the psoas tendon in front and the pubic ramus behind and the injection is performed.\n\nGroup 2 (Suprainguinal Fascia Iliaca Compartment Block) : Linear USG Probe (7-13 mHz) is placed parasagittal to obtain an image of the SIAS. The probe is then shifted medially to identify the fascia iliaca, iliac muscle, internal oblique muscle and deep circumflex iliac artery. A 50 mm 21G block needle (Stimuplex A\u00ae:B. Braun Melsungen AG, Japan) is advanced in-plane from caudal to cephalic and injected between the fascia iliaca and iliac muscle.\n\nGroup 3 (3-1 Block) Linear USG Probe (7-13 mHz) is placed at the femoral fold and femoral vein-arterial-nerve is visualized. The femoral nerve is located below the fascia iliaca. At this point, a 50 mm 21G block needle (Stimuplex A\u00ae:B. Braun Melsungen AG, Japan) is inserted in-plane from lateral to medial and injected lateral to the femoral nerve. After injection, pressure is applied distal to the needle entry site to spread the local anesthetic proximally in the nerve sheath.\n\nThe VAS score of the patients will be reevaluated and recorded during positioning for unilateral spinal anesthesia 30 minutes after the block is performed. Patients with VAS \\> 3 will be administered sedoanalgesia with propofol - ketamine combination as rescue analgesia before spinal anesthesia and recorded in the case report form. (1 = need sedoanalgesia / 2 = no need sedoanalgesia) Unilateral spinal anesthesia will be administered by Anesthesiologist B after the patient is positioned so that the fractured hip remains at the bottom. The quality of the patient's position will be evaluated by Anesthesiologist B administering spinal anesthesia and recorded on the case report form (0 = inadequate, 1 = adequate, 2 = good, 3 = optimal) All patients will be routinely administered 1000 mg acetominophen 3x1 in the postoperative period.\n\nAll patients will be followed up in terms of VAS score and possible opioid requirement in the postoperative 24 hours and evaluated in terms of satisfaction with the procedure.\n\nPatients will be monitored for 24 hours in terms of undesirable side effects and if signs of vascular puncture, hematoma, LA toxicity are observed, these events will be recorded in the case report form and serious adverse reactions will be reported.",

Healthy gut microbiota is known to prevent the colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by pathogens, the so-called mechanism of colonization resistance, but this protective mechanism can be altered by therapies that impair gut microbiota, including antibiotics with consequent colonization of gut pathogens, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE). CRE carriers represent an epidemiological threat to other hospitalized patients and to the whole community, but are also at risk of developing clinical consequences of this colonization, including bloodstream infections from these pathogens. Neomycin has shown high efficacy in the eradication of CRE invitro. Neomycin has also been approved to treat hepatic coma by eradicating bacterial in gastrointestinal tract.

      "detailedDescription": "Neonatal goal-directed echocardiography (TNE) performed by neonatologists has been increasingly applied to hemodynamic assessment in the NICU to guide critical neonatal treatment in real time. There are many detection indexes of TNE, which are closely related to neonatal weight, birth weight, postnatal age, race and other factors. Therefore, establishing neonatal echocardiographic reference ranges is essential for the development of TNE. At present, there have been normal reference standards for echocardiography in children and adults at home and abroad, but there is no uniform standard for echocardiographic parameters in newborns, especially premature infants. At present, there are many problems in establishing the reference range of neonatal echocardiography internationally, including the small sample size included in establishing the reference range, no premature infant standard for some parameters, the reference range is not stratified according to gender, etc. Moreover, the majority of current echocardiographic reference ranges are derived from studies in European and American populations and are not applicable to Asian patients. So far, reference ranges for neonatal echocardiography established based on high-quality clinical studies are still lacking, greatly affecting the use of echocardiography in neonatal intensive care units. Therefore, this study intends to carry out a national multicenter, prospective, observational study to establish the reference range of echocardiography at different time periods after birth in neonates, and stratify according to creatinine, birth weight and gender, providing a reference for the application of echocardiography in neonatal intensive care units, and providing an important basis for the development of TNE-centered neonatal hemodynamic comprehensive assessment program in the NICU.\n\n1. Study Design and Process:\n\n   This study is a multicenter, prospective, observational study. Neonatal bedside echocardiography was performed by a trained neonatology clinician or sonographer. Five time points were selected for neonatal echocardiography, namely, 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, and 28 days after birth. The examination was completed in the quiet state of the newborn, and the measurement method was based on the American Guidelines and Standards for Echocardiography in Children and the American NICU Echocardiography Practice Guidelines. All ultrasound data were averaged over three or more cardiac cycles.\n2. Sample Size Calculation:\n\n   Each participating NICU will be required to enroll 300 infants (60 infants for each PNA timepoint) for a final sample size of 1500 \"normal infants\".\n3. Statistical Methods:\n\n   Data statistics were performed using SPSS 21.0 software. The data obtained for each of the ultrasound hemodynamic parameters were tested for normality. The measurement data conforming to normal distribution are expressed by mean \u00b1 standard deviation, and the measurement data with non-normal distribution are expressed by median (interquartile range). Spearman correlation analysis was used to compare the correlation between different indicators and postnatal, birth weight, birth weight and gender. The echocardiographic reference range of newborns at different time periods after birth was established by 95% confidence interval and stratified according to birth weight, birth weight and gender. P \\< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n4. Quality control:\n\nAt the beginning of the study, a cooperative group kick-off meeting will be organized to interpret the study protocol in detail. In addition, the online or offline training of the participating units will be carried out to further unify the parameter setting and data collection criteria of the ultrasound machine. Establish a WeChat group to answer questions related to this study at any time. During the process of the project, regular contact meetings within the cooperative group will be held to ensure that the investigators participating in the study will implement the protocol. During the study, the study site will assign a special person to review the completeness and correctness of the data submitted by each participating site.",

In this study the aims are to: 1) Adapt the mhGAP-IG to primary school settings, 2) Implement the adapted module-based school program and investigate effective implementation strategies and teacher, student, and caregiver outcomes, 3) Develop, implement and evaluate an intersectoral supervision, referral and communication model between the health and education sectors, and 4) Develop sustainable and scalable implementation advice and guidelines with policymakers.\n\nMethods: This project is a pragmatic mixed-methods hybrid Type II Implementation-Effectiveness study utilizing a co-design approach. The main study will utilize a stepped-wedged design with phased implementation where participating schools will be randomized to intervention initiation. Those not yet randomized to the intervention will serve as \"controls\". There will be six starting sequences and three schools will be randomized to intervention initiation at each randomization interval. In addition, other quantitative designs including a nested prospective cohort, case control studies, cross-sectional studies in addition to qualitative research will strengthen the necessary components for successful implementation and evaluation.\n\nPopulation: Teachers are the primary participants in the trial. In addition, data will be collected from health personnel, school leadership, pupils and their caregivers.\n\nOutcomes: Implementation outcomes include detection, reach, sustainability and service delivery to children and adolescents in need of the mhGAP from the school and health sectors. Main client outcomes include teachers\u00b4 mental health literacy, stigma and violence towards the school children. Child and caregiver outcomes will include mental health status, mental health literacy, and help-seeking behavior.\n\nDiscussion: This study will provide knowledge on implementation and sustainability of mental health programs relevant for children in primary schools in line with current WHO guidelines.",

      "detailedDescription": "Deep neuromuscular blockade is known to improve surgical conditions in procedures such as abdominal or pelvic laparoscopic surgery, laparotomy and laryngeal surgery. In addition, deep neuromuscular blockade enables a reduction in pneumoperitoneal pressure, postoperative pain and the incidence of intra-operative and postoperative adverse events. Correspondingly, the use of deep neuromuscular blockade is increasing, and for its maintenance neuromuscular monitoring is essential; the use of neostigmine may also be helpful in achieving a rapid recovery. Magnesium sulphate has gained prominence as an adjuvant drug in multimodal anesthesia and pain medicine. It has several clinical indications, including attenuation of the adrenergic response to tracheal intubation and improved peri-operative analgesia. Magnesium sulphate also enhances the action of non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs, resulting in potentiation of neuromuscular blockade (NMB).The site of magnesium potentiation of neuromuscular blocking drugs is the motor end plate, where magnesium reduces the release of prejunctional acetylcholine, thereby decreasing the muscle membrane excitability. However, limited data exist concerning the effect of magnesium sulphate on the duration of deep or intense NMB and on the period of no response to nerve stimulation. In this study, the investigators will compare the effect of magnesium sulphate pretreatment on the onset and duration of intense and deep neuromuscular Block of rocuronium versus Cis-Atracurium and on the period of no response to nerve stimulation in children undergoing elective open abdominal surgeries.",

In the literature, a variety of qEEG parameters have been proven informative in the prognosis of stroke. In addition, it has been demonstrated that changes in certain qEEG parameters during traditional/task-specific rehabilitation approaches are correlated with clinical outcomes of functional motor recovery. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been proposed as a non-invasive and therapeutic treatment used to accelerate and enhance the recovery process of motor function in stroke patients. Many studies have reported that inhibiting contralesional rTMS may have positive effects in stroke patients with severe upper extremity motor impairment. In this context, the aim of the proposed study is to investigate whether there is a correlation between the change in qEEG parameters and the improvement of motor functions associated with rTMS treatment and to provide an electrophysiological prognostic biomarker of inhibiting contralesional rTMS for stroke patients.",

      "detailedDescription": "Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a favorable alternative for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) patients of all surgical risk profiles. Patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) underwent TAVR had similar 30-day mortality as well as stroke and new pacemaker implantation rates compared to tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) subjects, but carried higher risk of moderate/severe perivalvular leakage (PVL), conversion to surgery and device failure. Clinical experience in China suggests BAV and heavy calcium burden are more common among TAVR candidates than US/EU cohorts.\n\nMorphological characteristics at supra-annular structure (from annulus to the level of sinotubular junction) are quite complex in BAV, especially concomitant with heavily calcified leaflets. From our previous single center clinical practice, \"waist sign\" above the annulus during balloon aortic valvuloplasty in TAVR was often observed in patients with bicuspid AS, suggesting that supra-annular structures are the most constrained portion of BAV anatomy where the prosthesis anchors and seals. Therefore, we developed a balloon based supra-annular sizing strategy for self-expanding valves implantation in BAV and the device failure rate as well as pacemaker implantation rates were relatively low as shown in previous cohort study. Several other studies have also achieved successful outcomes associated with device \"down sizing\" (using a device smaller than that recommended by annular sizing).\n\nThe aim of this study is to compare \"down sizing\"strategy (experimental group) versus annular sizing strategy (control group) in BAV patients undergoing TAVR with self-expanding valves.",

It is part of the Sustainable Human Development Training Pathway of the Vice-Rectorate for Equality, Inclusion and Sustainability, and 3 ECTS will be accredited for the completion of any of the UGR official degrees.\n\nThe main objective of the study is to test whether participating in a competence-based course can improve students' cognitive, emotional and personal traits as well as academic performance. Together with this main purpose, the present study also aims to compare the effects of two competence-based programs on the students' ability to improve specific aspects of cognition, emotional intelligence, creativity or academic performance among others. Both programs involve training sustained attention and an accepting and open attitude though they differ in several aspects of their methods, intention and aims.\n\nDrawing conclusions from the research and outcomes, pedagogies which are best suited to develop theses competences at the Higher Education level will be suggested. Assessment and certification of this kind of competences will also be proposed.",
      "detailedDescription": "The content of the UGRComp program (M\u00e1s Presente, Arm 1) was designed in 2021 using the European LifeComp framework, the content of the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program (MBSR, Arm 2) follows the University of Massachusetts and Brown University specifications, and the content of the neuro-muscular stimulation program has been designed for the purpose of this study and is a combination of educational sessions and specific physical exercises to enhance physical wellbeing and prevent neuro-degeneration (Arm 3). Arms 1 and 2 will attend classes at the University of Granada premises. Arm 3 will receive training under the supervision of a Clinic specialized in Sport Medicine, also in Granada (Spain). Instructors of the three arms are fully certified and have more than 10 years of professional experience in the field.\n\nAll UGR undergraduate students are informed and invited to participate both in the course and in the study. They can choose to participate either in the study alone, in the course alone or in both. However, they are advised that, in the event that there are more applications than places, priority will be given to those who have registered earlier and those who choose to do the study.\n\nSo that the 3 ECTS credits of the course can be validated for the completion of the Degree as prescribed by the European Higher Education Area, a petition was filed to the Vice-Rectorate for Teaching and Learning of the UGR. This petition was inserted in a broader proposal by the Vice-Rectorate for Equality, Inclusion and Sustainability as part of the Sustainable Human Development Training Pathway. In this petition, the content of the course, design and aim of the study, potential participants, duration and other issues related with the project were included and explained.\n\nThe UGR grants some facilities (lecture rooms and Administrative and Support Staff's help). Vice-Rectorate for Equality, Inclusion and Sustainability will be responsible of the accreditation and certification processes. The Civitas-UGR Chair is responsible of co-funding and the study members from the Mind, Brain and Behaviour Research Center (CIMCYC) of the University of Granada (Spain) are responsible of study design, LimeSurvey management, randomization and data analysis.\n\nAll participants are asked to fill in an informed consent, a demographic questionnaire to determine eligibility and a battery of tests. Eligible participants are randomly assigned to either group.\n\nAll questionnaires are uploaded to the UGR LimeSuvey platform, an open source online survey tool specially designed to develop, publish and collect survey responses. This software is the one recommended by the University of Granada to present and collect online data for research purposes as it complies with all current legislation and ensures that all protection data requirements are being effectively met.\n\nFor specific security guarantees, an institutional email account is created through which all communication related to the project is carried out. In the same line, all the documentation generated within the project is uploaded and shared on a virtual cloud owned by the UGR (www.ugrdrive.ugr.es).\n\nIt is expected to find improvements in all measures (psychological and academic) in the two experimental groups (students in Arms 1 and 2) after completing the course compared to pre-training and compared to an active control group (students in Arm 3). In order to measure potential specific effects of each mindfulness program, pre-training to post-training psychological measures will be compared once completed the program. Altogether, this applied study might help to elucidate whether these important transversal competences and soft skills can improve with mindfulness-based techniques and ultimately could be recommended as part of the official curricula of degree in Higher Education.",

Currently, the Interleukin-6-inhibitor tocilizumab is used in combination with GC to achieve higher remission rates and lower cumulative GC-doses. The use of tocilizumab also has some disadvantages. One is the increased susceptibility to infections. On top of that, a long-term follow-up of the phase II study by Villiger et al. showed a 55% relapse-rate after discontinuation of intravenous tocilizumab after a median of five months.\n\nStudies have also shown that methotrexate(MTX) in combination with GC was able to prevent relapses and reduce cumulative GC doses.\n\nThe aim of the study is to evaluate whether MTX is superior to placebo to prevent relapses in subjects with GCA after Remission-Induction Therapy with Glucocorticoids and Tocilizumab.

Prior to the study period, video streaming was gradually implemented in the intervention group during a 6-months period (1st of July 2022 - 31st of December 2022).\n\nUsing a cluster randomized setup, the aim was to investigate differences in the management of emergency calls (dispatches) when emergency medical service (EMS) dispatchers use video streaming compared with telephone-only (audio-only) communication. All emergency calls will be randomly distributed between the two clusters.",
      "detailedDescription": "In Denmark, all emergency medical calls are answered by a nurse- or paramedic trained in dispatching emergencies. The EMS dispatcher determines the level of urgency and the type and number of resources to be allocated (e.g., ambulance, physician-manned vehicle and/or physician-manned helicopter (HEMS). The decision-making process is supported by a standardized national criteria-based dispatch tool called Danish Index for Emergency Care (DI). DI is a tool that classifies the patient's main complaint into different symptom groups (chapters) to determine the level of urgency required and which resources to allocate.\n\nAs standard, emergency calls are based on telephone-only (audio-only) communication, which might limit the understanding of a complex clinical presentation.\n\nPrevious studies suggest that a visualized clinical presentation could aid the EMS dispatchers in their decision-making and dispatch.\n\nThe decision on implementing video streaming has been made by the management board of the Prehospital Emergency Medical Services, Central Denmark Region, Denmark. It has been decided to implement video streaming gradually to allow for this cluster randomized study. Because video streaming is a deemed part of the standard operating procedure (SOP), ethical approval from our local ethical committee is waived. After the study period, video streaming will be implemented in the current control group as the decision to use video streaming as SOP has already been decided.",

      "description": "Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a rheumatologic condition occurring in patients \\> 50 years old, characterized by inflammatory pain of the scapular (shoulder) and pelvic (hip) girdles. PMR is most often isolated but can be associated with giant cell arteritis (GCA), a large vessels vasculitis, in 16 to 21% of case. The main features of GCA are headaches, jaw claudication, visual disturbances, abnormal temporal artery, scalp tenderness associated to elevated CRP and/or ESR. However, GCA could be asymptomatic in particular in case of isolated involvement of large vessels (subclinical GCA).\n\nGCA requires high doses of glucocorticoids, compared to isolated PMR, to avoid complications resulting from vascular remodeling (stroke, blindness). Ruling out GCA in PMR patients relies on the performance of some complementary exams that explore cranial vessels as color doppler ultrasound and/or temporal artery biopsy and large vessels that relies on PET/FDG or angio CT scan.\n\nThe aim of this study is to identifie serum biomarkers that could rule out or identifies GCA in patients with PMR features. Ultimately, if biomarkers are identified, this could allow to select PMR patients in whom complementary exams are needed or not. For this study, investigators chose to explore thrombomodulin. Thrombomodulin is a protein that is increased in the circulating blood during vascular inflammation, and therefore seems to be a good candidate for distinguish isolated PMR from PMR associated with GCA.",

The study sample consisted of 114 women in total, 57 of whom were in the intervention group and 57 were in the control group. The women in the intervention group were provided with genital hygiene behaviors training. The study data were collected Identifying Information Form, Genital Hygiene Behavior Inventory (GHBI), and Self-Care Agency Scale (SCAS).",
      "detailedDescription": "Design The study was designed as a randomized controlled trial in which the subjects were randomly assigned to the intervention (receiving genital hygiene training) and the control group.\n\nThe study was conducted in the Family Health Centers of two randomly selected villages with a distance of 20-30 km to Van province located in the east of Turkey. These villages are in a rural area and people make their living mostly through farming. Each village had one family health center, and other health institutions were in the provincial center. Family health centers are primary care health institutions which provide reproductive health service for women (healthy woman follow-up, laboratory tests, family planning, education, counselling, etc.). While training is provided within the scope of preventive health services in family health centers, there is no training provided specifically on genital health regarding vulvovaginal candidiasis. Working hours are between 08.00-17.00 every weekday, and there are three family health doctors and three family health professionals (midwife and/or nurse) in these centers.\n\nSample The study sample consisted of women who tested positive on at least one culture test and received and completed treatment for vulvovaginal candidiasis in the last year according to the registry of the Family Health Centers. The study inclusion criteria were being within the age range of 18-49 years, not having a systemic disease, and not being pregnant or puerpera between the dates when the study was conducted. According to the registration system of the family health centers, 1,400 women who met these criteria were receiving service from these centers.\n\nIn order to predict the most suitable sample size for the study, priori-power analysis was performed on a web-based software (https://www.stat.ubc.ca/\\~rollin/stats/ssize/n2.html). Sample size was calculated to be 57 for each group (57 in the intervention group and 57 in the control group) with 5% margin of error at two-way significance level, 95% confidence interval, 80% power of representing the population and by assuming that the mean score of genital hygiene behaviors, which was 84.51 (standard deviation 5.69), would increase by three points. According to the records of the family health centers where the study was conducted, there were 142 women who received and completed treatment for vulvovaginal candidiasis in the last six months. 142 women were assigned to the intervention and control groups through randomization. Women were listed by the researchers for randomization. According to the list, women with odd numbers were assigned to the intervention group and those with even numbers were included in the control group. The sample selection process carried out in line with CONSORT criteria is presented in Figure 1.\n\nData Collection Tools In the collection of the study data, Identifying Information Form, Genital Hygiene Behavior Inventory (GHBI), and Self-Care Agency Scale (SCAS) were used.\n\nIdentifying Information Form: The form developed by reviewing the literature consisted of questions inquiring about the sociodemographic characteristics of the women (age, educational status, employment status, etc.).\n\nGenital Hygiene Behavior Inventory (GHBI): The scale was developed in Turkish in order to measure genital hygiene behaviors of women, and the validity and reliability study of the scale was conducted by Karahan in 2017. The scale consists of three subscales, which are \"general hygiene\" (12 items), \"menstrual hygiene\" (8 items), and \"abnormal finding awareness\" (3 items). The 23-item and 5-point Likert type scale is scored between 1 and 5. The minimum and maximum scores to be obtained from the scale are 23 and 115. As the score obtained from the scale increases, the women's levels of displaying proper genital hygiene behaviors increase. The Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient of the scale is 0.80.\n\nSelf-Care Agency Scale (SCAS): The scale was developed by Kearney and Fleischer in 1979. The Turkish validity and reliability of the scale was conducted by Nahcivan in 1993. It is used to measure individuals' self-care agency levels. Each item of the 35-item and 5-point Likert type scale is scored between 0 ad 4. The minimum and maximum scores to be obtained from the scale are 0 and 140. A high score on the scale shows the individual's high level of self-care agency. The Cronbach's alpha internal consistency of the scale is 0.89.\n\nProcedures The women assigned to the intervention and control groups were called on their telephone numbers registered at the family health center by the researchers to inform them about the study, and they were invited to the family health centers. The pretest data were obtained from the women through the scales used in the study and the questionnaire on their sociodemographic characteristics by face-to-face interviews held by the researchers in the counselling room in the family health centers. Four weeks later, posttest data were collected by following the same procedures.\n\nFollowing the pretest, \"genital hygiene behaviors training\" was provided to the women in the intervention group by E.S.B., one the researchers. In addition, a genital hygiene brochure prepared by the researchers which included the same content as the training was given to each participant. The training program was carried out as oral instruction as well as using the demonstration method which is called as \"tell-show-do\". Individual questions of the women were answered at the end of the training. In the first meeting with the women, 2 sessions of 45 minutes with a 10-minute break were held in the counselling rooms of the relevant family health centers. Two weeks after these sessions, a 45-minute session was held in order to reinforce the training with the same method. No intervention was made to the women in the control group.\n\nGenital hygiene training program was developed by reviewing the literature, and expert opinion was taken for content check before application. In line with the opinions of three academics in the field of nursing, necessary corrections were made, and the training program was finalized. The training program included introduction of reproductive organs, properties of genital discharge, achieving hand and general hygiene, genital infections, hygiene rules in sexual contact, ensuring genital hygiene during menstruation, problems related to genital organs, and coping with genital problems.",

      "description": "Pes planus is a deformity called \"flatfoot\" and is defined as the valgus of the hindfoot while loading the foot, the disappearance of the medial longitudinal arch in the midfoot, and the supination of the forefoot relative to the hindfoot. The aim of this study is to compare the subtalar angle, q angle, trunk muscle endurance, and performance of individuals with pes planus and healthy controls. Volunteer students between the ages of 18-35 will be included among the students studying at the Health Sciences University G\u00fclhane Faculty of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation. The feet of individuals who want to be included in the study will be examined by the researchers with the navicular drop test and the presence of pes planus will be determined according to this test. Subtalar Angle to determine the degree of rotation (Varus/Valgus) in the hindfoot, Q Angle for knee biomechanics, Navicular Drop Test to determine flat feet, Mcgill trunk Flexion, Extension, and Lateral Bridge Test to evaluate trunk endurance, Xbox to evaluate lower and upper extremity performance 360Kinect\u2122 game console will be used. In this study, statistical analyzes will be made with SPSS 21 package program (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Wilcoxon test or Mann Whitney U will be used after determining the conformity to the normal distribution in the comparison of the values before and after the exercises, individuals with and without flat feet. Results will be evaluated at the significance level of p\\<0.05. Cohen's d values will be calculated to determine the study effect size.",
      "detailedDescription": "The navicular drop test is a test used to measure the amount of pronation in the foot, which is obtained by subtracting the navicular height measured while standing with weight on the foot, from the navicular height measured in the sitting position without placing weight on the foot. While individuals are sitting on a chair with bare feet, the navicular tubercle will be marked on both feet and marked at the level of the navicular tubercle on a card on the floor. Then, the individual will be asked to stand up, and the navicular tubercle level will be marked again on the same card while giving full weight to the foot. The expression in millimeters of the distance between both lines will be recorded as the amount of navicular drop. The amount of navicular drop between 6 and 9 millimeters will be considered as normal MLA, and if it is 10 millimeters or more, it will be considered as pes planus. This test will be done for both the right foot and the left foot To measure the subtalar angle, the participants will be asked to lie face down with their feet hanging out of the bed. The subtalar neutral position (without the foot in pronation or supination) will be determined, and the calcaneal midline and the distal 1/3 tibial longitudinal midline will be marked with a line. The pivot point of the goniometer will be placed on the midline of the Achilles tendon and one arm will reference the distal 1/3 tibial longitudinal midline while one arm will refer to the calcaneal line and the deviation angle will be recorded. The deviation angle in the valgus direction will be given a negative (-) value, and the deviation angle in the varus direction will be given a positive (+) value. This measurement will be made for both the right foot and the left foot The Q angle is the angle between the line extending from the anterior superior iliac spine to the middle of the patella and the line drawn from the middle of the patella to the tibial tubercle. Measurements will be made by means of a goniometer. Its normal value is 8-14\u00b0 (average 10\u00b0) in men and 11-20\u00b0 (mean 15\u00b0) in women. Right Q angle and left Q angle will be measured with the patient in the supine position and without contracting the quadriceps Mcgill trunk flexion test is a test used to evaluate the endurance of trunk flexor muscles, McGill trunk extension test trunk extensor muscles, McGill lateral bridge test is a test used to evaluate the endurance of core muscles that provide lateral stability. In the Mcgill trunk flexion test, participants will be asked to cross their hands on their chest and will be positioned on the floor with their trunks flexed at 60\u00b0 and their knees flexed at 90\u00b0. Sixty degrees of body flexion will be provided by a stretcher with an adjustable head. It will be ensured that there is no support behind the person during the test. In the Mcgill trunk extension test, the participants will be positioned in the prone position with their spina iliaca anterior superior to the side of the bed. Participants will be asked to extend their upper body straight forward from the edge of the table and will be fixed above their knees with the help of a belt. Before the test starts, the upper extremity will be supported with the help of a stool placed on the floor to prevent fatigue. When ready for the test, the participant will be asked to raise their hands on the stool and cross them in front of their torso and stand parallel to the ground. In the Mcgill lateral bridge test, the participants will lie on their dominant side, place their foot on the other foot, cross their non-dominant arm over their chest and place them on the dominant shoulder, and the dominant forearm shoulder straps. The participant will be asked to stand on the elbow. As soon as the participant is ready, he will be asked to stand on his forearm with his body on a single line, and the stopwatch will be started, which will raise his hips. The person will be asked to maintain the positions for as long as possible. Before the tests, individuals will be shown how to do the tests and they will be given a trial for a few seconds. The stopwatch will be started and the test will be started, in case of any deterioration in its position, the stopwatch will be stopped and the test will be terminated. The elapsed time will be recorded in seconds. Mcgill trunk flexion-extension and lateral bridge tests were previously performed in healthy individuals and their validity and reliability were found to be high. (McGill trunk flexion intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.97, McGill trunk extension intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.97, McGill lateral bridge intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.99) (37.38.39).\n\nXbox 360Kinect\u2122 game console was used for upper and lower extremity performance evaluation. Xbox Kinect; There is an infrared Kinect camera sensor that can detect user movements without the need for a special controller, the movements of the user in the virtual reality environment can be monitored in real-time on the screen. Before starting the play therapy, the patients were informed about the games by the physiotherapist and they were shown how to play the games. 100 m running game in Kinect Sport for 100 m running performance, single-leg jump game in Kinect Sport for single-leg jump performance, discus throw game for upper extremity performance. will be determined and the scores of the participants will be recorded. Kinect is a valid and reliable method for evaluating upper and lower extremity function In this study, statistical analyzes will be made with SPSS 21 package program (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Wilcoxon test or Mann Whitney U will be used after determining the conformity to the normal distribution in the comparison of the values before and after the exercises, individuals with and without flat feet.

In this context, it is important to note that a relevant portion of acute ischemic stroke patients die from adverse cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction, rather than from complications associated with the stroke itself. A possible reason might be that this patient group often suffers from at least moderate asymptomatic coronary artery disease. This study seeks to integrate cardiac computed tomography angiography into the standard-of-care diagnostic protocol of acute ischemic stroke. The aim of this prospective mono-centric trial is to enable accurate diagnosis of therapy-relevant coronary artery disease, other concomitant cardiac findings and cardiac causes of acute ischemic stroke, without delaying stroke therapy. In the long-run, the goal is to investigate whether cardiac computed tomography angiography and the resulting therapeutic measures (interventions or medications added) can improve functional outcome and rate of adverse cardiac complications in patients with acute ischemic stroke compared to a retrospective matched-cohort of patients without cardiac CT imaging.",

Four minutes before the ROP, the infant will be monitored and physiological parameters will be recorded, and three minutes before the ROP, the experimental group will start to listen to music (Video recordings will be evaluated by three experts, PIPP-R and PICS). The music recording will continue to be played during the ROP examination for music group. No application will be made for the control group other than the clinical routines.",
      "detailedDescription": "This randomized controlled experimental study is planned in order to determine the effect of music on pain, comfort and physiological parameters in preterm infants in ROP examination matched for gestational age, gender and birth weight. The research sample will consist of 28 preterm infants who meet the inclusion criteria. In the literature, the number of infants varies between 10 and 30 in different studies in which music was applied to preterm infants. In this study, it was decided that the number of infants in the groups should be 14 according to \u03b1=95% confidence level and 90% power. In the study, it was planned to have 14 infants in the music and control groups. After reaching 28 preterm infants in the study, power analysis will be calculated using pain scores and it will be decided whether the sample size is sufficient or not. All bodies of preterm infants will be recorded with a visible video camera for an average of 10 minutes, 4 minutes before the start of the ROP examination and 4 minutes after the completion of the ROP examination (for PIPP-R and PICS scores). The infants in the music group (Acem A\u015firan Maqam music prepared by T\u00dcMATA group) will be applied music for a about total of 10 minutes, starting 3 minutes before the ROP examination and continuing during the ROP examination, 3 minutes after ROP examination. After the necessary disinfection process is done, the voice recorder will be placed in the incubator at a distance of 45 cm from the head of infant and the sound level will be adjusted to an average of 45-60 decibels. The examination will begin with the placement of the speculum in the eye. The duration of the examination varies according to the visibility of the retinal vascularity, and the examination will end with the removal of the speculum from the eye (mean ROP time 1.61 \u00b11.59).

The participants (N=330) will be randomized to either dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo o.d. in a blinded fashion. Researchers will than use kidney transplant biopsies, measured GFR, blood pressure sampling, glucose tolerance test (OGTT), dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA scan) and estimated GFR from the two groups in comparison, to evaluate the effect treatment. The participants will be followed for a total of 3 years.",
      "detailedDescription": "This is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial with dapagliflozin 10 mg vs. placebo o.d. in kidney transplant patients. The patients are randomized 1:1 to active: placebo treatment 6 weeks after transplantation and followed for a total of 150 weeks (156 weeks post-transplant).\n\nBefore treatment initiation (6 weeks after transplantation) the following investigations will be performed;\n\n1. Estimated GFR: Assessed using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease 4 (MDRD-4) formula and is presented as mL/min/1.73 m2. Plasma creatinine concentrations are to be analyzed at the Department of Medical Biochemistry where the patient is followed and is presented as mmol/L. (Estimated GFR will be calculated from at least 4 plasma creatinine measurements per year).\n2. Blood sample: Measured variables include plasma creatinine, hemoglobin, hematocrit, sodium, potassium, magnesium and uric acid.\n3. Kidney tissue analyses: a.) Light microscopical evaluation in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) kidney graft biopsies: Semi-quantitative estimation of percent graft fibrosis in the renal cortex according to the Banff classification, percent interstitial fibrosis and percent inflammation outside fibrotic scars. b.) Immunohistochemistry: Graft samples will be deparaffinized and boiled in antigen retrieval solution and then exposed to primary antibodies against collagen and extracellular matrix markers, e.g. periostin, tenascin and picrosirius red. In addition, p16INKa, a marker of premature aging, and endothelial markers to evaluate capillary density will be used.\n\n   c.) Samples will be digitally scanned to perform digital morphometric evaluation using the softwares 3D Histech, Analysis Pro and QuPath. Areas not of interest (renal medulla, scar tissue, capsule or subscapular areas), poor quality scans and artefacts will be excluded. Digital software will also be used to estimate glomerular volume and mesangial volume fraction using QuPath. All evaluations will be performed by investigators blinded for the study participants' identity and clinical data. This is an explorative study, and no power estimate is available.\n\n   d.) The investigators will also perform molecular analyses, mRNA and proteomics in a subsample (n=25 in intervention, n=25 in control group, matched for age, gender and eGFR as appropriate) at the same two time-points as described above (altogether n=100 biopsies processed for RNA sequencing and proteomics), using standard bulk mRNA/miRNA sequencing and proteomics of whole sections from 'RNA later' kidney graft biopsies (Genomics and Proteomics Core Facilities, UiO). The investigators will also perform bioinformatic analyses focusing on fibrosis.\n4. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT): Will be performed in persons not on glucose-lowering treatment by ingestion of 75 g glucose dissolved in water (or 1 g/kg if body weight is \\<75 kg). Blood samples for measurements of glucose, insulin and C-peptide are collected at 0, 30 and 120 min, respectively. Glucose tolerance is assessed by the 2-h glucose value, while first phase insulin release is primarily reflected by the 30 min insulin value which is included in the Stumvoll equation which measures both first and second phase insulin release. Insulin sensitivity will be assessed by the Matsuda equation.\n5. Protein/creatinine ratio: Will be assessed at the Department of Medical Biochemistry where the patient is followed. Open urinary stix is not considered appropriate, partly due to the risk of unblinding in case of glucosuria detection by a combined stix. (Protein/ creatinine ratio will be collected from at least 4 urine sample measurements per year)\n6. Blood Pressure: Will be assessed as both systolic and diastolic measure, and measurements are performed according to standard procedures (measured in mmHg ). The same standard will be followed for blood pressure measurements at the local hospitals.\n7. Metabolomics: Urine and serum will be sent on dry ice in larger batches. LC-MS methodology will be used for the analysis, using a commercial kit (Biocrates). ELISA methodology will in addition be used in case verification analyses are necessary. This exploratory analysis will focus on markers for fibrosis, inflammation and secretion function in the kidney tubuli.\n\n   After 2 weeks the patients will go through repeated blood sampling and blood pressure measurements, followed by the following procedures;\n8. Measured GFR: Assessed at the Laboratory for Renal Physiology, by the iohexol serum clearance method utilizing the Bayesian estimate 4-point method. Serum samples are to be obtained 10 min, 30 min, 2 h and 5 h after administration of 5 mL Omnipaque (300 mg I/mL). measured GFR (Iohexol serum clearance) and DXA assessed body composition (subcutaneous and visceral fat percentage of total fat mass) is assessed, after 72 weeks of treatment all investigations/biobanking performed before and after 2 weeks are repeated. Then, after 150 weeks, the final visit is performed, including blood pressure measurements and the urinary protein/creatinine ratio and clinical chemistry determinations.\n9. DXA scan: Total body composition will be determined by a narrow fan-beam Lunar Prodigy Densitometer (GE Healthcare) and all the scans will be analysed using enCORER software version 14.10 (GE Medical Systems, Lunar Corp., Madison, WI). The automated software is capable of discriminating subcutaneus adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) within android region of interest (ROI). In vivo, short-term coefficients of variation for total body tissue and lean and fat mass are 0.1%, 0.8%, and 2.5%. The VAT short-term repeat measurement error coefficient of variation is 9.8% DXA-derived VAT was previously validated against CT, the standard method for the quantitative assessment of intra abdominal adipose tissue.\n\nAt week 78 patients will go through repeated analyses of the tests listed above. They will also go through 24 hour blood pressure tests 8 weeks, 72 weeks and 150 weeks after randomization.\n\nThroughout the study all plasma creatinine and urinary protein/creatinine ratios will be included in the study clinical research form (CRF). Safety measures will also be included. Measured GFR will measure the chronic GFR slope, while estimated GFR will assess the total GFR slope (both the early dip and the chronic slope of GFR). Furthermore, after the final study visit, which represents150 weeks of blinded treatment, all patients will be allowed further open treatment with SGLT2-inhibitors to the discretion of the treating physician and the patient. Furthermore, eGFR slope, graft loss and cardiovascular events will be followed based on annual data from the Norwegian Renal Registry for up to 10 years after transplantation.\n\nFor a more detailed description of primary and secondary objectives and endpoints see bellow.",

      "detailedDescription": "The phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of dysmetabolism in the Greenlandic Inuit population are yet to be described in detail. However, the unique interaction of genetic and environmental factors in this population and its effect on disease development calls for further investigation. Therefore, we aim to examine how metabolic diseases manifest and progress distinctively in this population compared to Western populations.\n\nThe study employs whole genome sequencing, with a focus on identifying variants in the TBC1D4 gene, which is linked to muscular insulin resistance, and HNF1\u03b1, associated with MODY (Maturity-onset Diabetes of the Young) diabetes. In addition, the prevalence of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) in relation to metabolic disorders is examined. Our methodology combines genetic analysis with clinical evaluations to understand the impact of these genetic factors on disease manifestation and potential complications.\n\nThe findings will likely offer a unique perspective on the genetic influence on metabolic diseases in the Greenlandic Inuit population, highlighting the significance of novel genetic variants for disease management and prevention. The study investigates the relationship between metabolic disorders and OSA, and aims to describe how diagnosis and treatment of OSA can be introduced in an Arctic setting. This research emphasizes the need for genotype-aware treatment approaches and culturally tailored healthcare strategies, not only for the Greenlandic Inuit but also as a model for personalized medicine approaches in other populations. The insights gained here contribute to a deeper understanding of metabolic diseases, potentially influencing future global healthcare strategies.",

      "description": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by a rapid decrease in renal function. It is frequent in hospitalized patients and its incidence is higher in critically ill patients. It is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality.\n\nAKI affects over 13 million people per year globally, and results in 1.7 million deaths. It is diagnosed in up to 20% of hospitalized patients and in 30- 60% of critically ill patients. It is the most frequent cause of organ dysfunction in intensive care units and the occurrence of even mild AKI is associated with a 50% higher risk of death. AKI has been associated with longer hospital stays, in-hospital mortality, cardiovascular events, progression to chronic kidney disease and long-term mortality. It results in a significant burden for the society in terms of health resource use during the acute phase and the potential long-term sequelae including development of chronic kidney disease and kidney failure. Yunos et al. have focused on chloride, which is the most abundant strong anion in extracellular fluid. Progression of hyperchloremia in the ICU was identified as a predictor of increased mortality in a large retrospective cohort study of critically ill septic patients. Sadan et al. have shown associations between hyperchloremia and an increased incidence of AKI in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, as well as in patients who have undergone abdominal surgery. Abnormal blood chloride concentrations were associated with metabolic acidosis, which may worsen patient outcomes. Moreover, hyperchloremia may be caused by inappropriate fluid management with chloride-rich solutions.\n\nImportantly, chloride-rich solutions were reportedly associated with hyperchloremia and major adverse kidney disease, including death, in intensive care settings. Urine samples are relatively easy to collect in ICU, and real-time urinary electrolyte monitoring device is available for clinical use. In addition, recent development of urinary AKI biomarkers has enabled clinical evaluation of kidney function. Komaru et al. examined associations among urinary chloride, mortality, and AKI incidence in ICU patients and concluded that lower urinary chloride concentration was associated with increased mortality and incidence of AKI in the ICU.",

      "description": "Distal malignant biliary obstruction results from different types of tumors including pancreatic cancer, biliary tract cancer (BTC), gallbladder cancer, and metastasis, which can lead to obstructive jaundice. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) represents the gold standard for jaundice palliation in this setting of patients. However, surgically altered anatomy (i.e., Whipple intervention, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, Billroth II surgery), periampullary diverticula, gastric outlet obstruction, and malignant obstruction of the lumen determine the failure of the procedure in about 5-10% of cases, requiring alternative methods of decompression. Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) and surgical bypass are well established alternatives in these patients, but associated with increased morbidity, longer length of hospital stays and higher costs, and patient discomfort.\n\nIn 2001 Giovannini et al. described the first EUS guided biliary drainage (EUS-BD) through a transduodenal access with a needle knife. Subsequently, EUS-BD has considerably evolved thanks to the development of dedicated devices such as lumen apposing metal stents (LAMS), specifically designed for endoscopic ultrasound procedures. LAMS are made up of braided nitinol, that is fully covered with silicone to prevent tissue ingrowth, with wide flanges on both ends to provide anchorage.\n\nRecently, LAMS have been incorporated into a delivery system with an electrocautery mounted on the tip (Hot Axios; Boston Scientific Corp.), which allows the device to be used directly to penetrate the target structure without the need to utilize a 19G needle, a guidewire, and a cystotome for prior dilation. This has been described for drainage of peri-pancreatic fluid collections, common bile duct (CBD), gallbladder, and for creation of gastro-jejuno anastomosis. The biliary drainage procedure performed with LAMS is a one step procedure that requires less or no need for accessory exchange and becomes faster, thus potentially decreasing the risk of complications.\n\nThe procedure has been described as safe and effective with a technical success of 98.2 %, clinical success of 96.4 %, and low rate of complications 7 % (duodenal perforations, bleeding and transient cholangitis) \\[6\\]. A systematic review and meta-analyses showed clinical and technical success rates of 87% and 95% respectively \\[7\\]. Currently, the EUS-BD is indicated as a rescue therapy for jaundice palliation after ERCP failure. Actually, only a retrospective series is published in literature about the gallbladder (GB) drainage in patients with malignant biliary obstruction (MBO), demonstrating the feasibility of gallbladder drainage to relieve malignant distal bile duct obstruction in patients with failed ERCP. No data are actually reported, especially in a prospective way, about the GB drainage as first intention in patients with MBO.",

      "description": "There is increasing evidence of a strong, bidirectional correlation between the gut and the skin, that associates gastrointestinal health with skin homeostasis and allostasis. The dysregulation in the intestinal microbiome-host interplay is connected with the development of many chronic skin inflammations.\n\nPlaque psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated non-communicable dermatitis affecting approximately 2-3% of the world's population, regardless of gender and age. In most cases (about 70-80%), the skin lesions are mild and do not require systemic treatment. Its etiology is not fully understood, but apart from the genetic predisposition, it is strongly associated with the \"gut-skin axis\". The rise of the local and systemic immune response in psoriasis is a consequence of systemic inflammation due to intestinal dysbiosis associated with increased intestinal permeability. Thus, gut microbiota modulation should become a research target due to its great potential to impact inflammation, including skin dermatitis, and its manifested consequences.\n\nDiet is an underestimated element in psoriasis management, meanwhile, the dietary ingredients support skin health. Among them, prebiotics favorably alters the composition and activity of the intestinal microbes and alleviates inflammation in the intestines. It was hypothesized that restoring the balance of the gut microbiome and the proper functioning of the intestinal barrier in subjects with psoriasis will alleviate the inflammatory symptoms and skin lesions observed in this chronic dermatitis.\n\nThe goal of this clinical trial is to determine if a diet supplementation with prebiotic (chicory-derived inulin-type \u03b2-fructans; ITFs) vs. placebo (maltodextrin) will induce health-related benefits in a mild degree PS, and determine if the identified benefits are evoked by compositional and/or functional shifts of the intestinal bacterial communities. Healthy individuals will constitute a control group (C).",
      "detailedDescription": "The gut microbiota contributes to the health of the host. It enables the digestion of food, the proper functioning of the immune system, and protection against the invasion of pathogens. The gut microorganisms play a key role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal epithelium. The epithelium serves as a selective barrier that, on the one hand, separates the immune cells of the intestinal mucosa from the microorganisms present in the lumen of the gut, and at the same time allows microbial metabolites to interact with the host cells and thus regulate the immune response. Dysbiosis of the intestinal microflora may result in damage to the intestinal integrity and, consequently, an increase in the permeability of the intestinal barrier. The translocation of bacterial antigens and metabolites into the bloodstream contributes to the activation of the local and systemic immune response resulting in local and systemic inflammation. Disruption of the interaction between the gut microbiome and the host can lead to inflammation. Plaque psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated dermatitis. It is manifested by peeling, itching, and reddening of the skin. Psoriasis is a non-communicable disease affecting approximately 2-3% of the world's population, regardless of gender and age. In most cases (about 70-80%), the skin lesions are mild and do not require systemic treatment. The etiology of psoriasis development is not fully understood. In addition to genetic predisposition, the increased immune response in PS may be a consequence of systemic inflammation due to intestinal dysbiosis associated with increased intestinal permeability.\n\nDietary ingredients support skin health. Among them, prebiotics gained our special interest as ingredients with proven beneficial effects on host health by modulating gut microflora. Inulin-type fructans derived from chicory are prebiotics that favorably alters the composition and activity of the intestinal microbes and alleviates the inflammation in the intestines. The investigators supposed that restoring the balance of the gut microbiota and the proper functioning of the intestinal barrier in subjects with psoriasis will alleviate the inflammatory symptoms and skin lesions observed in this chronic dermatitis. The aim of the research is to determine whether dietary supplementation with inulin-type \u03b2-fructans derived from chicory will transfer health benefits to individuals with psoriasis and to investigate whether these benefits are due to modification of the composition or activity of the gut microbiota.\n\nTo achieve this goal, the original, advanced, and complex studies were proposed on subjects with psoriasis to investigate the effects of dietary inulin-type fructans on the characteristics of the gut microflora, metabolic parameters, and biomarkers of the skin-gut axis. The obtained results will provide new knowledge and explain the nature of the interaction between the gut microbiota and the skin, providing further clues about the functioning of the gut-skin axis.",

      "description": "The implementation of an mechanical in-exsufflator device (MI-E) requires specific expertise because it is a complex device that requires fine-tuning of the settings according to different clinical situations to optimize its effectiveness. Generally, it is performed by experienced physiotherapists in neuromuscular disease reference centers or directly at home via medical-technical home care providers.\n\nTreatment data is recorded by the machine at each MI-E session, which may be daily or less frequent, depending on the patient's dependency. All of this information can be accessed by manually downloading the data from the SD card that comes with each MI-E machine. Therefore, the retrieval of this information systematically requires the visit of staff to the patient's home.\n\nTo date, compliance with these devices is not regularly measured since there is no means of telecommunication allowing remote monitoring of these therapies, whereas technological development in the field of remote monitoring has allowed remote monitoring of patients with sleep apnea syndrome treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and, more recently, of some patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency treated with invasive ventilation (NIV). These developments are transforming on the one hand the follow-up of patients under NIV at home by the medical and paramedical teams and on the other hand the financial coverage by the health insurance organizations (ETAPES programs). Within the framework of NIV therapy, we think that remote monitoring of the quality of the sessions, i.e. measurement of peak expiratory flow, insufflated volumes, frequency and duration of the sessions, could facilitate and improve the follow-up of these patients for the medical-technical providers, the expert physiotherapists and the doctors of the reference centers. It is still too early to assume the extent to which data from remote monitoring of MI-E devices would improve patient follow-up. Nevertheless, given the increasing number of devices installed over the past several years, it is likely that the issue of telemonitoring will become a central issue. Thus, in this observational trial, we propose to evaluate the feasibility of a simple system of remote monitoring of MI-E devices in non-therapy-naive patients, with the objective of assessing the barriers and limitations of remote monitoring in this population.\n\nPrimary aim is to evaluate the feasibility of remote monitoring of data from the MI-E device used in the patient's home in neuromuscular diseases.\n\nPatients will be identified by the investigators using the AGIR \u00e0 dom software package (medical-technical follow-up file). If the patient accepts, the information and no-objection form will be sent to them electronically or by mail following this call, and at least 3 days before their scheduled appointment.\n\nDuring the patient's usual follow-up visit, if the patient does not object to participating in the study, AGIR staff in dom will install the device. This visit will take place in the patient's home. During this visit, a SanDisk (SD) Eye-Fi SDHC 4GB + WiFi Class4 memory card will be inserted into the port provided, in place of the memory card already present in the MI-E device. Then a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B will be placed in the room where the MI-E device is normally used by the patient, and connected to a power source (accessible electrical outlet in the room). The wifi SD card, which uses the device's power supply, will communicate with the Raspberry Pi via the wifi network and upload the recorded data each time the MI-E device is used.\n\nAfter 90 days, a routine recovery visit will be scheduled. AGIR \u00e0 dom staff will replace the wifi SD card installed during the D0 visit with the standard SD card originally provided with the MI-E device. The data locally on the SD Wifi card will then be downloaded for analysis and comparison with the data being uploaded",

Please note, ultimately a total of 10 schools were recruited, with 5 assigned to each arm.",
      "detailedDescription": "Aevidum was established in 2009 as a student-led initiative to raise awareness and reduce the stigma surrounding mental illness. Their mental health curriculum and club activities are currently used in over 300 schools in Pennsylvania and surrounding states. In comparison to current interventions, Aevidum is unique in that it provides students the opportunity to build a strong support system among peers. Aevidum's curriculum and club activities provide an opportunity for schools and students to engage with mental health and suicide prevention materials with a student-directed method. Youth voice is a powerful tool that schools and communities can utilize to make mental health and suicide prevention programming more impactful. Allowing youth the chance to lead and let their voices be heard can create greater buy-in for activities.\n\nAt present, there is not a strong evidence-base for the efficacy of student-led initiatives that aid in reaching mandated Act 71 curriculum standards for mental health and suicide prevention. Aevidum lacks an evidence-base for its curriculum and club programming, which is freely available to schools. To continue offering free resources, while also maintaining and updating these resources to ensure they are innovative and best reflect student needs, Aevidum needs to establish an evidence-base to support future funding. This project plans to evaluate the effectiveness of these efforts in supporting adolescent mental health. Results will be used to inform school-based mental health programming and to establish an evidence-base for the Aevidum program, furthering mental health awareness and education, while also reducing mental health stigma.\n\nWhile set up as a randomized clinical trial, this portion of the study is largely exploratory and has not be formally powered. Knowledge, help-seeking, school environment/stigma and program visibility will be assessed both in a pre/post assessment and compared between study arms as follows:\n\nAim 1: Assess Aevidum's curriculum in improving students' mental health knowledge and help-seeking intentions.\n\nHypothesis: Exposure to Aevidum's five module mental health curriculum will result in significant improvements in knowledge and help seeking intentions between pre- and post-survey measures using the published University of Michigan Depression Center (UMDC) Peer-to-Peer Depression Awareness Assessment among the 6 schools assigned to curriculum only.\n\nAim 2: Assess the combination of Aevidum's curriculum AND club activities to improve student perceptions of school culture.\n\nHypothesis: Exposure to both curriculum and club activities will have the added benefit of improving school environment/stigma and program visibility in addition to knowledge and help-seeking on the Peer-to-Peer Depression Awareness Assessment among the 6 schools assigned to curriculum + club.\n\nIn secondary statistical analysis, the curriculum-only schools will be compared to the curriculum plus club activities schools directly.\n\nSpecifically: 1) Compare students from schools in Aim 1 (curriculum only) to those in Aim 2 (curriculum plus club) regarding changes in knowledge, help-seeking behavior, school environment/stigma and program visibility.\n\n2) Compare the impact on 9th graders in curriculum schools versus 9th graders in curriculum plus club schools (curriculum will specifically be delivered to 9th grade students at all participating high schools).",

      "detailedDescription": "The proposed study will assess the safety, feasibility, preliminary results and neurological aspects of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy in the treatment of hospitalized patients with treatment-resistant depression.\n\nScreening, after signing the ICF, is done in patients newly admitted to the psychiatric service of Ghent University Hospital or patients referred for hospitalization through the outpatient clinic of the psychiatric service of Ghent University Hospital. Involved patients are hospitalized at the Anxiety, Compulsion and Mood Unit for 8 weeks. They will receive add-on treatment with psilocybin-supported psychotherapy in addition to standard treatment (daily group therapies, mainly non-verbal and activating). This consists of a preparatory phase (4 sessions of 1.5 hours before the first psilocybin session and 1 session of 1.5 hours before the second psilocybin session), the psilocybin sessions themselves (2 sessions, week 3 and week 6) and an integration phase (3 sessions of 1.5 hours after each psilocybin session). All sessions occur with the same 2 therapists throughout the entire course. Therapists are trained to provide experiential and systemic psychotherapeutic interventions.\n\nAfter hospitalization, weekly outpatient follow-up consultations continue until 12 weeks after the last psilocybin session. Subsequently, patients may still agree to a prospective, observational and naturalistic follow-up until 1 year after the last psilocybin session, during which they will be called monthly by a psychiatrist from the research team to inquire about current mental status and any therapies undertaken in the interim.\n\nDuring the study, patients are required to fill out questionnaires at regular intervals. Video-recordings will be made of certain parts of the preparation and integration sessions, for analysis with the client experience scale (EXP). The morning of each psilocybin session, female patients must provide a blood sample for a pregnancy test. The morning of each psilocybin session, all patients must provide a urine sample for toxicology screening. EEGs are also taken from patients the day before each psilocybin session, the morning of the first integration session after each psilocybin session and 12 weeks after the last psilocybin session (at the last outpatient consultation). At the start and at the end of the hospitalization phase, a semi-structured interview will be conducted with the patient to gauge expectations on the one hand and experiences on the other.\n\nThroughout the study, the patient's partner will be involved. The partner must complete a number of questionnaires at baseline and throughout the study and will have to be present at 3 EEGs. In addition, the partner will also participate in 1 preparatory session and 2 integration sessions. The partner will also be given the opportunity to spend the night of a psilocybin session with the patient in the hospital (rooming-in). At the start and at the end of the hospitalization phase, a semi-structured interview will be conducted with the partner to gauge expectations on the one hand and experiences on the other.",
